Hello everyone,

This past weekend Al and I went to Bullfrog; he rode his motorcycle
and I drove my dry, comfortable 4-wheels. He's training for a cycle
trip to OK to visit relatives this September....

Boxerlover - I did not get your stamp in my book either.  I thought 
your stamp was so pretty and your carving was great. Thanks for the HH

Hi all,

My clan and I finally got our long lost letterbox retrieved and 
posted.  I'd love to upload the clues to the LBNA site but I can't 
log in.  So... in lieu of that, I'll post the cluses...

First, the good news:  the Enginerd letterbox isn't a total loss.  
It did stink of urine, but probably only got in through a small hole 
in the outer ziploc.  Nothing inside the box itself seemed...

Hi all,

While not a frequent poster, I do read all that comes across the
board.  Inspired by all your spring 'boxing I've got out there a bit
myself recently.  While in Manitou Springs for a little...

I'm expecting to have to pull the Enginerd box today, but I can't log

Got an email this morning letting me know that one of my placed
