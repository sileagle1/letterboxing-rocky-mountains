                        The report of the demise of 'Steinbeck #1: Pigasus' was somewhat

my offer of help with the decryption of the clues.

                        Hi again!
It looks like there are a few people interested in meeting up over 
the last week of December.  Does anyone have any suggestions of 
places that may be somewhat central to the local boxers,...

                        A big thanks to Dixie and Cappy for scooping up my endangered Fodor!  I will get him replaced as soon as it's safe.
