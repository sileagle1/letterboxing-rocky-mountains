You don't NEED to send Phoenix Rising to me.  I'm hoping that sometime

                        Heck I voted for the pie!

If you want votes for Ren faire w/e I put my vote in for Jul 16 instead of the 30th (I work
the Burro races in Fairplay that w/e).

                        There is a poll up for one week about the Colorado Map. I think every

                        Hi all,

Went on a lovely little hike up the Mesa Trail to snag a box at 6:30AM 
this morn.  I had to be in the office to start something at 6AM but 
didn't need to hang around!!  It's a lovely hike...
