                        This box was pulled for repair this morning.  I hope to have it back out
by the end of the week.  However, it will be put in a new location.
Winter is coming and the area it was in will be a drain...

made it magnetic rather than velcro - so hopefully it will last a little

So, I'm assuming that the picnic area, etc., around Buffalo Bill's
