                        This box didn't move today... we couldn't find any other spot.  I will
need to redo clues though as I think the ones I made are not enough to
find the box.

                        There is a good possibility that this box will be pulled and moved on
Sunday morning.  If it is moved, I will update the clues by Monday
afternoon.
