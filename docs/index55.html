Big questions to ponder:
What did we talk about before there was pie?
       or

Or the haiku:

Letterbox and Pie
Look! Esmerelda snacking

Dear Boxer Lover, please do not ever say anything like "What's the

Thanks, everyone, for the nice welcome! 

As luck would have it, my husband and I will be at Bullfrog in late
April. His motorcycling group is holding a rally there and he will
ride his cycle down....

I picked up the Footloose Box from Roxborough last week.  I trudged 
through tons of mud and my boots were huge - but I made it up and

I have a plan - If you can get your HH to Moab, I will be there     
(hiking and looking for pie and boxes) in April.   Then, I will get 
your HH to Kokomo, Indiana and someone can take it further...
