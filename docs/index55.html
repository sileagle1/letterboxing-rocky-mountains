The Lemony Letterbox is back!

The clue has been updated because we found (hopefully) a better 
hiding place, so don't try to use an old copy of it.

Happy Hunting!

I have a plan - If you can get your HH to Moab, I will be there     
(hiking and looking for pie and boxes) in April.   Then, I will get 
your HH to Kokomo, Indiana and someone can take it further...

You can't really go wrong with any of the boxes in the Moab area. But 
I kinda like the Ticaboo and Lulu's day out series. It's a short walk 
but you feel really secluded. And I like...
