                        V22 is my "virtual" letterboxes.  It's up to 22 now.  You find the 
clues, and solve online puzzles to come up with the final stamp 
image.  They're harder than they sound (some of them).

                        I apologize to all.  I messed around with some settings on the poll, 
and promptly nuked all of the responses.

                        Hey Julie,
Just a thought - but you might want to go FIND that box before 
adopting it, to make sure its still there.  I can't get confirmation 
from anyone that's actually been there. 

And that...

                        I think it would be interesting to take a poll to see which boxes in 
the Front Range area most of us have already found, or want to go 
find.

Then - perhaps we could schedule a gathering that would...

I don't know about the rest of you - but sometimes reading the 
hundreds of emails regarding New England letterboxes can be a bit 
intimidating.  

So - I've created this list so that we...
