                        Hi - I'm looking for letterboxes in the northern Colorado region 
(Fort Collins - Loveland) and haven't come up with anything.  Does 
anyone know of any boxes stashed in my area?  I tried googling...

                        Howdy,
Just wanted to let you all know that we finally went on our first

 It was a beautiful location.  I thank you all for...

                        Hiya -

Just in case someone was planning on hunting this this weekend,  
wanted to let you know that two of the buccaneers went to check up on 
it and found it missing. Bleh! It was so well hidden...

You guys are a bucketful of information!  Thanks.  I can't wait to get
started.  Maybe by the end of the summer we will be planting some boxes up
in this area... so keep your eyes...
