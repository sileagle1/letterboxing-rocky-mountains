                        I found a new spot for Fodor, just in time for Halloween.  Not 100% comfortable with the spot... but.  *shrugs*  I'll get clues up tomorrow.

                        Because of its location, I've pulled Union Station until after the 
baseball excitement is over.  At that point it will be replaced 
promptly, probably with a fresh logbook.

Go Rockies!
