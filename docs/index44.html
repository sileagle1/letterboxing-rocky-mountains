The Loveland LB isnt on the main site anymore I dont think.  Why dont you contact the Drew clan and ask them if they think its still there?  You mean the one with the 7.7 mile hike, right? ...

                        Kathy, I show the Continental Divide box was found on June 25, 2005 so that is probably still there.

Which other one are you talking about?

                        Maintenance has been completed and The Shining is back in business, as of

it'll hold up pretty well now.
