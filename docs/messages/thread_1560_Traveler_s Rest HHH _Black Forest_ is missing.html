checked on it. Sure enough, it's gone. Even the piece of concrete block that was on top of it <br>
was gone. Only the bark covering remained, scattered around. I hope whoever stole it is <br>
wracked with guilt!! >:( I just feel extra bad for the 4 owners whose HHs were in there. I don't <br>
even know who they are to let them know that they're gone.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just wanted to let everyone know in case you were planning to visit it soon. I'll get it re-carved and replanted as soon as I can, though probably in a slightly different location.<br>
