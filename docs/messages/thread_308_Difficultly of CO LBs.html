letterbox clues for all of the boxes in CO.  (My husband wished I could<br>

Anyway - I am working on labeling them yes or no based on if we can take<br>
the kids with us.  Matthew is 2 and Maggie is 3 1/2.  They are pretty<br>
good hikers.  This last weekend they were able to go with us to plant<br>
The King of All He Surveys (and we continued on this trail after<br>
planting the box - so probably a good 3/4-1 mile total walking).. then<br>
we went to lunch and out to hide Swimming in Opposite Directions (.67<br>
miles each way - most of which was flat).<br>
 <br>
Soooo with all of that, I am looking for information on the following<br>
boxes (the clues are not enough to tell me if the kids can make it):<br>
 <br>
Coyote Canter<br>
Sod Village Pioneer Adventure<br>
Abert's Squirrel LB & Parasite Box<br>
Bear Creek<br>
Chantress<br>
SoC #1<br>
SoC #2<br>
Star Box<br>
The Strangest Bird<br>
No Use<br>
Shining Star<br>
Zeke's<br>
Deer Creek<br>
Wings of Eagles<br>
Rainbow Trail <br>
Onion <br>
 <br>
I think I have figured out the rest - most of which are no's (we have<br>
found most of the yeses in Golden, Littleton & Morrison.)<br>
 <br>
Any help would be greatly appreciated! =]<br>

 No Use--- Yes, but be careful. Very short ways off road, kinda <br>
steep, with potential loose rocks if you go the wrong way.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Onion --  A definite yes.<br>
<br>
Great idea. You might want to upload a copy to the files section of <br>
this list so other people with kids can save some time.<br>

 <br>
I have to say, the new boxes that have been placed almost always say if<br>
it is kid friendly, and I know I REALLY appreciate that.  saves me time<br>
trying to figure it out.  =]   Of course, on mystrery clues and such,<br>
that can't always be done.<br>
 <br>
Well, I will upload the information asap... if anyone has any<br>
disagreements, please let me know as some of them I guessed on based on<br>
the clues.  <br>
 <br>
Whewn I do this, please remember, my kids are VERY young - but they have<br>
been hiking since they were babies... so, with that in mind, you will<br>
still have to think of your own child's abilities =]    I don't know<br>
many 2 & 3 year olds that can make 1.5 miles round trip (semi-flat<br>
ground) walking the whole way.  I mean shoot, my 13 year old even<br>
complains on hikes that long!  But, I could be wrong...   =]<br>

They should be able to do Wings of Eagles with a hand from Mom or <br>
Dad. It's up but it's a short ways and there's a path. <br>
But I also think they should be fine with Zeb Gump's Grizzly Creek, <br>
Crystal, Mustang and 16 ton.  And Big Fish!  Oh, and Buffalo Bill. <br>
LOL If there's any climbing at all in those it's short!<br>
