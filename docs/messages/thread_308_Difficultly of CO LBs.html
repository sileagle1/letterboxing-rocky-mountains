Great idea. You might want to upload a copy to the files section of <br/>
this list so other people with kids can save some time.<br/>

<br/>
I have to say, the new boxes that have been placed almost always say if<br/>
it is kid friendly, and I know I REALLY appreciate that.  saves me time<br/>
trying to figure it out.  =]   Of course, on mystrery clues and such,<br/>
that can't always be done.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I will upload the information asap... if anyone has any<br/>
disagreements, please let me know as some of them I guessed on based on<br/>
the clues.  <br/>
<br/>
Whewn I do this, please remember, my kids are VERY young - but they have<br/>
been hiking since they were babies... so, with that in mind, you will<br/>
still have to think of your own child's abilities =]    I don't know<br/>
many 2 &amp; 3 year olds that can make 1.5 miles round trip (semi-flat<br/>
ground) walking the whole way.  I mean shoot, my 13 year old even<br/>
complains on hikes that long!  But, I could be wrong...   =]<br/>

They should be able to do Wings of Eagles with a hand from Mom or <br/>
Dad. It's up but it's a short ways and there's a path. <br/>
But I also think they should be fine with Zeb Gump's Grizzly Creek, <br/>
Crystal, Mustang and 16 ton.  And Big Fish!  Oh, and Buffalo Bill. <br/>
LOL If there's any climbing at all in those it's short!<br/>
