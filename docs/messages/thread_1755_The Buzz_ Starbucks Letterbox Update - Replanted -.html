                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Buzz: Starbucks Letterbox was originally planted in April 2007.  Somewhere along the line it disappeared.  This weekend I re-carved the image and have returned the box to its original hiding spot (tempting fate that it will be left undisturbed).  Although I carved the same image again the original image was a simple outline.  The new image I "carved out" to show more detail.  When I compared the two I think the new image is a huge improvement over the old.  The box is hidden under leaves and is ready for visitors once again!  I would invite boxers who have already found the box to visit again and grab the new image.  Blackvelvetrav<br/>
