As you may know, goddess, Princess Tupil and I are heading to <br>
Scotland in a couple of months.  We've been in touch with a former <br>
Colorado letterboxer who lives there now and think we've identified <br>
a few letterboxes to find along our route.  We're also planning on <br>
leaving one with a prototype of goddess' signature stamp so in a way <br>
she can stay forever in Scotland.<br>
<br>
I was thinking, it might be fun to have some of you fine Rocky <br>
Mountain people's stamps in the log book we leave, so in a small way <br>
it's like you've travelled along with us.  If you're interested, <br>
please email me off list at jelybean "at" adelphia "dot" net and <br>
I'll tell you how to get an image to me.  I can offer in return to <br>
send an image of the stamp we're leaving, it's a nude goddess icon <br>
thingy, if you've seen goddess' signature stamp in a letterbox near <br>
you it's very similar, a little smaller.<br>
<br>
I also thought it might be fun to have some hitchhikers "cross the <br>
pond" so if you have a cool hitchhiker you'd like to donate, email <br>
me off list.  I can probably only take a couple.<br>

I was wondering if you had found some boxes to seek in Scotland. <br>
Sounds like you found not only boxes, but at least one boxer. And <br>
these ideas are very cool.<br>
<br>
I am also wondering if you will be wearing your summer, or your <br>
winter kilt when you get there.<br>
