                    <div class="plaintext-content">I received an e-mail from 2PUP this week and it looks like some of my <br>
newer boxes have already gone missing.  I ran out today to confirm <br>
and sure enough we have some missing boxes in Kuna, Idaho:<br>
<br>
Sidewinder:  Confirmed MIA<br>
<br>
Language of Purple:  <br>
Box # 1 Purple Prose  Alive and Well (somehow moved to the spot that <br>
box # 2 was in.  The clues have been updated)<br>
Box # 2 Purple Cow  Confirmed MIA<br>
<br>
Cowboy Angel:  Alive and Well<br>
<br>
Last night Lizman and I pulled the 3 remaining boxes from the <br>
Astrology series.  In total I was able to save 7 of the original 12 <br>
boxes.  But I am amazed that any of them were still alive.  Just like <br>
the night before the 3 that we found were not covered up at all.  <br>
They were just tossed back on top of their original hiding spots.  No <br>
rocks, sticks or leaves for camouflage.  I am not sure why I am <br>
finding my boxes so carelessly re-hidden if you can even call it <br>
that.  Yes, that is frustration you hear in my post.  It only takes a <br>
couple of minutes to properly re-hide a box for the next seekers to <br>
find in place alive and well.  Why have people become so sloppy here <br>
in Idaho with putting them back?<br>
