had a GREAT time and would like to thank all the placers for their <br>
boxes out that way.  Sorry it's a long post, but as some of you have <br>
figured out by now, it was a VERY full trip!<br>
<br>
The Trip West:<br>
<br>
I needed a stop and found myself at the Grizzly Creek rest area. Got <br>
out of car to poke around.  Had a very, very vague sense there was a <br>
box in this area, but for now I was just PREconnoitering for possible <br>
placing on the way back.  Poked around for maybe 10-15 minutes.  Went <br>
to this tree and looked upstream.  Hey I thought that would be a good <br>
place for a ..<br>
<br>
Wait a minute!  What's this?  Sure enough I'd ended up right on top of <br>
Es's box here w/o ever having read the clues!  Not even once.  My copy <br>
of them was in my car!  As I was busy printing out clues the week <br>
before I left I couldn't help wondering:  I wonder if anyone's ever <br>
found a box when they weren't really looking for one?  So, I can <br>
answer yes!  A nice giggly surprise for the first box of the trip!  <br>
<br>
Also, some perve was hanging out at the picnic table near this box.  I <br>
can also now confirm in the affirmative an opinion I've always had.  <br>
When I returned to the parking lot the only vehicle there was a REALLY <br>
big oversized truck which had to belong to pervert guy.  Let's just <br>
say, in this case it IS true what they say about guys with big trucks <br>
and the relative size of their "other equipment" .  Anyway, I <br>
digress...ahem!<br>
<br>
Made one more quick stop before Moab for Boxer Lover's Raft the <br>
River.  Loved how this stamp captured what it's all about here and how <br>
it inks up in color.<br>
<br>
Day # 1 BMAO in Moab:<br>
<br>
First stop Es's Westerns box.  Just what you'd expect in a Es box.  <br>
Great history, spot, log book and stamp.  I was still drinking coffee <br>
and waking up while sitting on a rock by the Dewey Bridge while <br>
stamping up.  Great way to start the first full day of boxing!<br>
<br>
Next on to Kennamtn's Inidgo box and a FF :-).  wahooo<br>
<br>
On to hike the rest of this trail.  Poked around to see if I might <br>
find the right place to begin's Y's Alien Gothic box, but never got <br>
going the right way, I guess.  Fisher Tower and this 4.5 mile r/t  <br>
hike was well worth hiking even (gasp) w/o boxes to find!<br>
<br>
Now kinda hot, tired, and hiked out went for a lovely drive along <br>
highway 128 along the Coloroda River - one of my fave roads in the <br>
whole country and a big part of the trip destination.  Nabbed <br>
rivergeek's Colorado River and Paddle Hard boxes.  Watched the sun go <br>
down and realized in BBD (Before Boxing Days) I'd floated by or driven <br>
by these boxes many times.  Then headed back to camp - sunburned, <br>
tired (in a good way) and ready for some campfire time and....<br>
<br>
pie!  Sorta....The next day being my actual bday I'd picked up some <br>
cheese cake for the trip. Cheese cake is like a "3-fer": It's like <br>
pie, it's like cake, and it's got cheese.....mmmmm cheese.  Made me <br>
think about more ideas for that Homage to Fromage box.  <br>
<br>
Day # 2 The Big, Big Day - Fools Day<br>
<br>
Oh I just get happy all over again thinking about this day :-)<br>
<br>
Spent the firt part of the day "hanging out with" Kat and her Desert <br>
Bighorn box (still working on coffee here...all that counting sure <br>
woke me up!), then Portal Trail #1, Stopped at Ye Ol' Climbing spot on <br>
the way home for Kat's Moab Man - what a cutey, <br>
then tagged along on with Lulu and Ticaboo on their big Day Out.  <br>
Delightful little canyon and felt in some way I was "there" with all <br>
you who went to the Box on the Rocks meet the PREvious year (almost <br>
exactly).  Had a giggle at Blackvelvtrav's Easy Rider Kokopelli (koko <br>
being a spring-oriented trickster and a lot like us April Fools) and <br>
literally laughed out loud at A & J Bear's Don't Bust the Crust box <br>
(cute little box and sneaky hiding spot too and after reading this <br>
line in SO many local boxes...Ha!)  <br>
<br>
I love all the wonderful colors and images in these two pages of my <br>
book.  So southwest, and the graphics are really my aesthetic style!<br>
<br>
Headed back to the car for some lunch across the road at the river <br>
before the plan was to hit Kat's Layers box.  Tried to start the car <br>
afterwards, even though I'd just moved it for a picnic and the stoopid <br>
thing wouldn't start.  Yikes!  A nice couple from Carbondale, CO <br>
helped me out with a jump to the battery, but I was paranoid now about <br>
driving into the back of beyond, shutting off the car and being <br>
stranded.  Drove into town and was determined not to shut off the car <br>
until I at mechanic - not easy to do on a late Saturday afternoon.  <br>
Once there, got some ice and supplies then held my breath as I started <br>
the car.  Bloddy thing started just fine!  Drove around town turning <br>
the car off and on, and the little green machine that clicked 90K on <br>
the way over was just fine - as it always has been sinc the day I <br>
bought it - huge relief!  <br>
<br>
Sheeze, I still got plenty of daylight left.  What's this dourown <br>
panel box, I thought as I sat in my car delaying restarting it and <br>
looking for something to read.  Haven't been out that way from town <br>
yet.  I had food, I had beer in the car along with some blankets.  So <br>
what if I get stranded (thankfully no more auto issues for the trip.)<br>
<br>
What an AMAZING canyon to be exploring right in that rosy tangerine <br>
glow of the sunset hours!  Then there's this box itself.  Wow, wow, <br>
wow what a terrific way to end a really great birthday!  I was <br>
grinning the whole way back to camp :-)..for more campfire and <br>
cheesecake (and red wine) ....<br>
<br>
Day #3 <br>
<br>
The only truly sunny, lovely day of the trip.  Having been so inspired <br>
by all the really awesome spots and boxes, I took the morning off to <br>
hang out at Hittle Bottom (love that name - it's a place not a body <br>
part) on the CO River in my lawn chair.  Sipping more coffee (have I <br>
mentioned I'm NOT a morning person and it takes me awhile to get <br>
vrooooming each day?) I dug through the few box-making supplies I'd <br>
brought with me to put something together to leave behind in Moab.  (I <br>
DID leave behind this box.  Coincidently it's called BMAO in Moab on <br>
LbNA.)  I also helped some kids make a sand castle on the beach that <br>
morning and, I realized too late, had also done a pretty good job on <br>
the beginnings of a sunburn.<br>
<br>
Some hikers on the trail back from Kat's Layers box that same day said <br>
my knees were about the same color as the surrounding rocks.  Ooops!  <br>
It was SO worth it, though!  Loved this series of boxes (I did <br>
geography in college) and the unbelievable hike, again in the rosy <br>
glow of sunset.  I just sat on a rock for an hour and watched the <br>
world.<br>
<br>
Day #4 - Last Day in Moab<br>
<br>
Packing it in this last day! Sheeze I only just realized in looking at <br>
my book how all over the place I was that day!<br>
<br>
Back to the canyon where dourown is to see some awesome rock art stamp <br>
art in the form of Aljan's Phoenix Rising box and an extra special <br>
treat I'd only heard tales of on this list.   Art on the Rocks by the <br>
Bears went hopping by my book, Snoeshoe Koko (Kat) - great view!), <br>
Fish Out out of Water (by 10 year old Lizman) on my way up to Dead <br>
Horse Point State Park.  <br>
<br>
Ok this place is amazing!  And again I arrived in time for Magic <br>
Hours.  Had the park practically to myself for an hour or so as I <br>
hiked around. Then when I finally did get around to looking for boxes -<br>
 holy crap, they kept popping up everywhere!  Then an off duty ranger <br>
showed up and walked by where I was with a LOT of boxing loot!<br>
(I'd recognized her from paying the park fee - it's SO worth the cash <br>
to see this park!) on her way to the vista point with her yoga mat.  <br>
Oh dear god, I have all these boxes, its getting late and I'll never <br>
be able to get them all back unobserved!  Do I still have food, beer <br>
and blankets in my car?  I'm gonna be here all NIGHT!<br>
<br>
Oh right - check!  Heck what do I care?  It's all good!  (hehehe <br>
there's something to be said for basically living out of one's car for <br>
a week.)  After getting a few boxes back OK I went and peeked at the <br>
vista point...what the??  Dunno WHERE she went (I suspect she went <br>
over the edge to a private spot) but I was able to get the rest of the <br>
boxes back tucked away safely.  The last evening in Moab turned out to <br>
be QUITE the boxing extravaganza!  Some talented placers in a <br>
phenomenal spot.  Great way to end the last day.  Ya'll rock!<br>
<br>
Day #5 The Way East<br>
<br>
Stopped off on my way back to I-70 to place Thompson Canyon and Just <br>
Say Go boxes.  I'd discovered this place years ago and did up a few <br>
boxes in advance to leave behind.  I hadn't even had a chance to email <br>
the Moab crew privately about their boxes, and to mention these clues <br>
were up before Kat piped up via LbNA totally excited.  Hehehe - nice <br>
to leave Happy Campers (who had made me equally happy during my <br>
trip) "in my wake" on the eastbound trip.<br>
<br>
I'd run out of daylight on my trip to Moab to stop by Commuting Those <br>
Were the Days (Kat) so made the stop en route back.  Great little stop <br>
off, history and image...and dinosaur exploring...<br>
<br>
Here beginnith the day of playing "tag" (in reverse) with arttrekker <br>
(who you might remember had posted on this list about her upcoming <br>
trip from Calif via Avon to NM.  I kinda role my eyes now too when I <br>
think about her.  She stamped into EVERY box between here and Glenwood <br>
on MY birthday....)Sheeze she doesn't mess around!  And snagged a HH <br>
who'd been sitting in this box for a bit I would have had! if I'd been <br>
able to stop on my way out.  She also managed to snag my FFs on two <br>
boxes I left in western CO (Ruler of the Schoolyard and No Name) less <br>
than 24 hours after I got home and got the clues up.  We some good <br>
laughs back and forth in email after I go home.<br>
<br>
And finally, that Napolean Dynamite guy sure is busy in Palisade. I <br>
got to see him, like 3 times, dudes and dudettes....right after, you <br>
guesse it, artrekker visited a few days before.<br>
<br>
Nothing like rolling into town at 11pm, having to unload the car, take <br>
your first shower in 4 days and get up in 7 hours later to go back to <br>
work the next day to begin to ruin a really, really good boxing buzz!<br>
<br>
Least it was only a 3 day week and I was able to get back out there <br>
both days last weekend here in the Denver area and got to meet Aljan <br>
in person.<br>
<br>
Yep, if life were any better these days I think it would be down right <br>
illegal!<br>

liked the tedious-to-color Raft the River and I look forward to<br>
finding your new boxes on my next excursion south. I'm not going to<br>
tell you just how close you were to Alien Gothic. I, too, missed it on<br>
the way in on that wonderful trail and like I told y-nought once, if<br>
it had been a snake it would have bitten me! You ended up with a *LOT*<br>
of fabulous letterboxes! We have been the fortunate beneficiaries of<br>
the efforts of the good folks in and around Moab (and their visitors)<br>
who have hidden some exceptionally fine boxes. I had the same<br>
experience you did after hiding When a Frog is a Horse; I didn't even<br>
get to announce it to this list before Kat emailed me that she and<br>
Kennamtn had found it! Anyway, glad you had a great trip (Happy<br>
Belated Birthday!) and thanks for the entertaining travellog.<br>
