though I am a proud Texan, I sometimes wish I lived in a<br/>
Rocky Mt. area.  However, since I'm a Southern boy at heart,<br/>
I just couldn't handle your winters.  I'll just have to be<br/>
satisfied visiting as often as I can.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I guess I didn't tell you about Texas ties.  I lived there for a <br/>
year and a<br/>
&gt; half (in the Houston area) while I did some work for my church.  I <br/>
have an<br/>
&gt; uncle who has been in the Dallas area for years, and two years ago <br/>
my father<br/>
&gt; moved out to the Dallas area as well.  When he did that, my <br/>
grandparents<br/>
&gt; decided it would be better to be close to two children as they were<br/>
&gt; approaching their 90s so they also moved to Dallas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's like there is this big Texas magnet pulling us.  I'm fighting <br/>
it pretty<br/>
&gt; hard though.  I enjoyed my time there, but I'm really not a TX <br/>
gal.  I need<br/>
&gt; mountains around me.  During that 1.5 years in Houston, I hadn't <br/>
come home.<br/>
&gt; I still remember flying back to SLC, and as we approached Colorado <br/>
and I<br/>
&gt; finally began to see mountains out of the plane window, I <br/>
literally began to<br/>
&gt; cry.  The person next to me must have thought I was losing it.  <br/>
Who cries<br/>
&gt; when they see mountains out of a plane window?  It just hit so <br/>
hard that I<br/>
&gt; finally knew I was coming home. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So that's the Texas story.  If Silver Eagle still reads the list, <br/>
I'm<br/>
&gt; saluting in his direction.<br/>
