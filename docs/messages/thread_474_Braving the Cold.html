Jodie, it sounds like you had a great fun start to the new year!<br/>
We thought we were escaping it a bit by having to go to Albuquerque <br/>
for a quick trip and coming home through Santa Fe, but it was COLD <br/>
and SNOWY and RAINY down there too! We still found four boxes, but <br/>
had to leave soooo many behind it just isn't fair! Maybe some pie <br/>
would help ease the frustration! LOL<br/>

Four boxes is good!<br/>
<br/>
My crew has been stranded in Flagstaff for threeeee daaaaays (most <br/>
whiney voice) and we couldn't even get out of the hotel to go <br/>
letterboxing.  Oh, the humanity.  But, they do have a computer that <br/>
I'm currently monopolizing, so, hi everyone! :::waves through the <br/>
snow flakes:::<br/>
<br/>
Kat...last weekend out of the blue Skeech said, 'we should go to <br/>
Moab and get those boxes you were talking about'.  So.. we did!  We <br/>
left late so only got to lulu and ticaboo, but we had a blast.  And <br/>
learned.. again...that you must read the clues!!  We spent a lot of <br/>
time looking in the wrong place for Ticaboo, but eventually had our <br/>
little lightbulbs flicker on and scrambled to glory!  Thanks for the <br/>
great afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Then we went to Dennys and had pie. <br/>

I work for Mesa so fly America West and United, depending on which <br/>
color plane I'm on and which city I'm headed to.  We're all express <br/>
flights. We also fly USAir express on the east coast, but you'll <br/>
never catch me there!  Used to fly Frontier until we got the new <br/>
United contract. Too much information? HEE!<br/>
