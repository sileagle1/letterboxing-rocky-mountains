Jodie, it sounds like you had a great fun start to the new year!<br>
We thought we were escaping it a bit by having to go to Albuquerque <br>
for a quick trip and coming home through Santa Fe, but it was COLD <br>
and SNOWY and RAINY down there too! We still found four boxes, but <br>
had to leave soooo many behind it just isn't fair! Maybe some pie <br>
would help ease the frustration! LOL<br>

My crew has been stranded in Flagstaff for threeeee daaaaays (most <br>

letterboxing.  Oh, the humanity.  But, they do have a computer that <br>

Kat...last weekend out of the blue Skeech said, 'we should go to <br>

learned.. again...that you must read the clues!!  We spent a lot of <br>
time looking in the wrong place for Ticaboo, but eventually had our <br>
little lightbulbs flicker on and scrambled to glory!  Thanks for the <br>
great afternoon.<br>

I work for Mesa so fly America West and United, depending on which <br>
color plane I'm on and which city I'm headed to.  We're all express <br>
flights. We also fly USAir express on the east coast, but you'll <br>
never catch me there!  Used to fly Frontier until we got the new <br>
United contract. Too much information? HEE!<br>

Es, who escaped from Flag and made it home tonight<br>
