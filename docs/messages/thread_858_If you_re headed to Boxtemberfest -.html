                    <div class="plaintext-content">and you've already printed out all the clues...you haven't!  Something <br>
like 9 new boxes have been added in the last few days!  I'll have clues <br>
printed out for all the area boxes available at the fest, but for those <br>
of you who plan of boxing on your way here, you might want to do a last <br>
minute check before you leave home.  <br>
<br>
Also, some of the clues have been updated (just tonight) to make <br>
changes brought on by snow plow damage, barricaded roads and one to try <br>
and help you a little more in finding it. :)  So.. once again, you <br>
might want to double check!<br>
<br>
Woohoo!  Good times, good times!<br>
<br>
Es, wondering if everyone checked the mystery boxes, too<br>
