                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do exactly as Es said. If I write it backwards I don't have to guess where <br>
I will end up and then I just put it in the right order as I write it. I <br>
usually start with a general idea of location though like a trail or a <br>
park--well sometimes even a city and then I go from there when I find a spot <br>
that works. If I am determined to hide in a predetermined spot, I may hide a <br>
box in a riskier location b/c I didn't consider all my options as I should.<br>
