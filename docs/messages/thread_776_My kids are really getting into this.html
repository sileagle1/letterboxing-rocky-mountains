I will end up and then I just put it in the right order as I write it. I <br/>
usually start with a general idea of location though like a trail or a <br/>
park--well sometimes even a city and then I go from there when I find a spot <br/>
that works. If I am determined to hide in a predetermined spot, I may hide a <br/>
box in a riskier location b/c I didn't consider all my options as I should.<br/>
