                    <div class="plaintext-content">As if it wasn't bad enough that someone made off with Super Uno Guy <br>
and just left the empty box lying around, we got a report that <br>
Dilbox was not where it was supposed to be and, when we went to <br>
verify, found that it was indeed missing.  For those keeping score <br>
at home, that's two missing boxes within a month and two missing <br>
Dilboxes within a year.<br>
<br>
Checked around the area for any sign of Dilbox, but there was <br>
nothing.  The hiding place barely appeared to be disturbed at all, <br>
so it seems strange that someone accidentally stumbled across it.  I <br>
had also included a note taped inside the lid appealing to anyone <br>
who accidentally found it to please put it back and not spoil the <br>
fun for others.<br>
<br>
We will, of course, re-carve and replace in a better spot nearby <br>
since we really like that area, but we'll probaby wait until summer <br>
so we don't end up hiding it in the midst of dense foliage that is <br>
only accessible in winter.<br>
<br>
Finally, does anyone have text that they use in or on their boxes to <br>
appeal to non-LBers to put the box back and not take it with?<br>

I hope you can find an equally good spot for it's replacement, that <br>

When one that's well hidden goes missing I tend to think someone was <br>
stamping in and was seen.  People passing through the area (tourist <br>
type boxers) can be in a hurry and not take the usual precautions.  <br>
In my own humble opinion. <br>
