Hey Preboxed - we want to thank you for a hike up to the mine! My <br/>
little sister is in Denver on business and had called yesterday to see <br/>
if we wanted to meet halfway for supper. So, Glenwood it was. <br/>
My son printed out a couple of boxes to find, but we only had time for <br/>
one. <br/>
Yes, we did see the marmot heading up the hill, poking around in what <br/>
looked to be washing machines or some sort of trash. The kids were <br/>
pretty excited and we loved looking, but not touching, the mine. <br/>
I have to say though, my dh was pretty sure we were going to be <br/>
arrested for going on mining company property. It was pretty funny, <br/>
and he was the first one back to the truck with our 2 year old on his <br/>
shoulders! <br/>
What an adventure, we're going back for the Riverwalk box! and the No <br/>
Name box!!<br/>
Also, it was our first time being FF! And our first hitchiker! <br/>
Yeah! We are soooooo hooked!<br/>

other side of the canyon in Eagle (listed on the High Country page).<br/>
If anyone is headed to Basalt, let me know, I left a box there and<br/>
have lost my clue sheet, so it has yet to be posted. I thought it was<br/>
going to be some sort of mystery, now it is to me as well! Hmmm, maybe<br/>
you can find it with no clues at all! Except that it's in Basalt, I<br/>
love to be last in line for the train, and it's on the opposite side<br/>
from all those books. And the wrong end for visiting. And you know how<br/>
I'm drawn like a magnet to where I can see those wheels go round and<br/>
round. There, that outta get you started. :)<br/>
