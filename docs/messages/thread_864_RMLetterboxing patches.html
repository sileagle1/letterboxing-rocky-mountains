lately -- Great Lakes and Texas just had some made, and Mid-Atlantic <br>

Has anyone given any thought to making a cool logo and patch for this <br>

RGBisMe (of RGBisMe and True Indigo) did the design. The LbMA group <br>
had a contest where people submitted designs and then everyone voted <br>
on their favorite.<br>
<br>
Here are some of the others, most by RGMisMe:<br>

(They are filed in the LbMA site's files section, but I pulled them <br>
out so you wouldn't have to join the group to see them.)<br>
