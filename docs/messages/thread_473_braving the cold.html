Turtles Can't Fly played host to my son's new stamp, then we played archeologists and hunted down stegosaurus (what a fine little stamp) on the hogback.  We finished up the day with the king surveying his lands and saw four of the BIGGEST buck mule deer we had ever seen!  It was a fine, fine day.<br>
 <br>
Happy Hunting in 2005!  Jodie, Donnie, Damien and Rowan<br>
