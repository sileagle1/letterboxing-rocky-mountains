I just posted some photos from our event in Santa Fe today - we all had <br>
a great time. Thanks again to everyone for coming, it's so wonderful to <br>

can all get together again before too long ;-)<br>

Judging from the smiling faces, it looks like you all had a great <br>
time!  I really wish I could have been there.  Santa Fe has great <br>
boxing even when there is no event, so I can only imagine how much fun <br>
the boxing was for the Spooktacular event!<br>
<br>
If only I didn't have the Race for the Cure tomorrow morning <br>
(http://www.komendenver.org/site/TRC/Race/General?<br>
pg=peditor&fr_id=1050&px=1289510) I would have been down there <br>
stamping myself.  If anyone wants to join me, you can still register <br>
tomorrow and I will bring my logbook/stamp so we can do an <br>
exchange.  :)<br>

Santa Fe!  We're sorry that we missed it.  We were busy lobbing pumpkins<br>

Last year, a stray winter squash knocked out one of Cirrus' teeth<br>

practically a textbook in the homeschool world.  For my own sanity it is<br>
a banned book at our house.  The Cloud Brothers get into plenty of<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to lionsmane, Astro D and Rubberpeace (and all the other folks <br>
who helped) for this awesome event. Our camera was suffering from <br>
operator error so my report will be verbal.<br>
<br>
First, the setting was unbelievably beautiful. A perfect spot for the <br>
gathering surrounded by colorful leaves dipping into crystal water <br>
that skitters down the rocks.......paradise.<br>
<br>
Then there was this constant flow of....event stamps that were <br>
inspiring, delicious food, exchanges and travellers, yummy food, a <br>
haunted wood full of bats, spiders, witches and a horseman (sans <br>
head), more food, some stories and more exchanges and a brownie.<br>
<br>
And we left thinking about what a great bunch of people we had just <br>
seen. Old friends that we saw in person for the first time......faces <br>
we could put with the stamp images we've been seeing for a <br>
while....and brand new friends that share the same appreciation for a <br>
good clue, the outdoors and folk art.<br>
<br>
The only thing that was lacking for me was more time to spend talking <br>
or heading down the road for a few more 'boxes. Seriously, for every <br>
letterbox stamp I got yesterday there are at least five more in that <br>
area on my wish list. And hunting letterboxes with new friends is <br>
such a kick!<br>
<br>
Oh well...I guess I'll just have to go back....<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>

LionsMane and all the other fantastic Santa Fe letterboxers really <br>
outdid yourselves!<br>
Being that this was my first letterboxing event, when we attend <br>
future letterboxing events, I know I will be expecting the same <br>
greatness.<br>
The stamps were extreme quality and well thought out and created. And <br>
the 'haunted trail' hike was such a blast and oh, so beautiful in the <br>
mountains.<br>
<br>
To all of you who made all those hot scrumptious soups....ahhhhhh <br>
yum....there are just no words to describe how delicious they were <br>
and how well they hit the spot before and after the haunted trail <br>
letterboxing and stamp exchanges!! Thank you!!!!!<br>
<br>
A few of us drove up to the Santa Fe Ski area afterwards to hunt for <br>
a few more letterboxes and the aspens were breathtaking in all their <br>
fall splendor!<br>
You guys could not have planned a better location, nor a better day <br>
for the Spooktacular! <br>
<br>
Oh and my kids really appreciated the goodie bags I brought home, <br>
too! You all put such thoughtfulnness into every detail.<br>
Thanks for such a fun day/event!<br>

I am nodding my head with everything you said. I enjoy sharing <br>
letterboxing with my Twinville Trekker family, but they are not as 'die-<br>
hard' as I can be and usually tolerate letterboxing for up to a 5-box <br>
limit......and Hey! At that point, I'm just getting started! hehehe<br>
<br>
So, at this past week's event joining a small group of fellow <br>
letterboxers, discussing and working out clues, while hiking and <br>
enjoying nature and chatting about letterboxing was such a blast! I had <br>
no idea it could be so fun.<br>
<br>
I was telling my huband later that night when I got home, that it was <br>
such an odd feeling afterwards remembering how I felt so welcomed and <br>
part of a tightknit community, as if noone, no matter that some of us <br>
had never met before, were strangers. I was a little nervous showing up <br>
by myself, not knowing anyone, except by trail names we've seen in <br>
logbooks and online. But it was like joining a letterboxing family or a <br>
tribe. Too cool.<br>
<br>
I can't wait to do this again.<br>
And if anyone is planning to visit Santa Fe or Albuquerque, please let <br>
us know. We will be happy to join you for some letterboxing or some <br>
chatting over coffee/tea.<br>
