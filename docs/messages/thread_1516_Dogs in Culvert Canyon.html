were a little farther than Gold Bar Tower which was across the canyon <br/>
from us. That was SUCH a sweet hike!<br/>
<br/>
Linus is a little too smart for his own good and gets bored waiting for <br/>
us slow people to stamp in and read logbooks. We need to work on his <br/>
little disappearing act. He is also driving our four cats crazy trying <br/>
to herd them all into one room. (He doesn't close the door, though).<br/>
<br/>
A little side note about the cats.......when we got back from Moab we <br/>
looked around for Garfield and finally heard him whimper from one of <br/>
the dresser drawers. He must have crawled in when we were packing and <br/>
got closed up in there for a day and a half (yikes!) Linus swears he <br/>
didn't do it!<br/>

&gt; Great pictures! Did you guys go very far up Culvert Canyon? I hope <br/>
you didn't knock over <br/>
&gt; that balance rock, LOL! I'm sorry I haven't replaced LuLu yet, doh! <br/>
The really amazing thing <br/>
&gt; is that we have a couple of Blue Stampers as well, and one of them, <br/>
Highway (guess where <br/>
&gt; we found him at 8 weeks old wandering down the yellow stripes)  could <br/>
be Linus's twin. If <br/>
&gt; Linus is as smart as Highway, you're in for a great time. If Highway <br/>
had thumbs, he would <br/>
&gt; be gripping his own stamp. He can open and close all the doors in our <br/>
house. I don't <br/>
&gt; know about his code-cracking skills..........<br/>
