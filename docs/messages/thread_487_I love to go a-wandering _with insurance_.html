 Actually, my card expired with the New Year so I need to pick up new <br>
ones for me and my boys.<br>
<br>
Kat, I think it would be a good idea for you to buy one if you are <br>
going to hike in Colorado, and that brings up the problem with this <br>
system. If we had a Nationally organized system that would pay <br>
regardless of where you were rescued it would be a lot better for <br>
people like me who live next to three other states. Or like CW <br>
Sunseeker, who moves around a lot. I brought this up on a <br>
Canyoneering message board and got shouted down bigtime, because each <br>
state prefers their own system and is unlikely to change theirs to <br>
match everyone elses. <br>
<br>
As it is now, anyone thinking of looking for my Grenadiers Letterbox <br>
would be wise to get one. Horses can't even get up there and a badly <br>
sprained ankle just might get you a helicopter ride.<br>
<br>
They just found a guy down here that spent three days lost behind the <br>
ski area in constant snow and avalanche danger. I think about 15 <br>
people on snowmobiles and skis spent two long days trying to find him <br>
in snow up to 8 feet deep. Remarkably, he's fine, but I hope he has <br>
an insurance card!<br>
<br>
y-nought.....who wished he had some pie to give the paramedics when <br>
his buddy got rescued last spring.<br>
<br>
