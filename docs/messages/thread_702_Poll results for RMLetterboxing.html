                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I'll ask Choi to redo the map. I double-checked the list of <br>
counties and three were left off the scheme that Ramdelt put forward:<br>
<br>
Denver--definitely goes in Front Range<br>
<br>
Rio Grande-- not really SW Colorado, but closer to it than Front <br>
Range or Eastern Plains.<br>
<br>
Conejos-- Same situation as Rio Grande, my tendency would be to put <br>
these in SW Colorado because they are at the foothills of the East <br>
San Juan Mountains.<br>
<br>
I would sure like to hear any opinions on this before I talk to Choi.<br>
<br>
As far as I know, we only had one complaint about the poll. It seems <br>
that someone wanted a region to be called "Colorado Pirate Country". <br>
I really can't say who that was....it's a secret.<br>
