<br/>
Generally, Steampunk is a fashion, design, and popular-culture phenomenon that combines romance and technology.  Among its many influences are futurism, time travel, and the Victorian Age.    These seemingly disparate facets combine into a resulting look that might be called "Mad Max Meets Jane Austen."<br/>
<br/>
In 1987, K.W. Jeter, author of Morlock Night, coined the term "Steampunk" to describe a genre of fantasy and speculative fiction that later came to describe an entire artistic and cultural movement.<br/>
