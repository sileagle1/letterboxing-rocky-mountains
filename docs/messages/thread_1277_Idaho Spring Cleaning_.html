have hit the trails to check on our local boxes for status updates.  <br/>
I hope to eventually check all of my Idaho boxes this spring and <br/>
summer updates will be constant on both Atlasquest.com and <br/>
Letterboxing.org.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are already boxing in Idaho, planning on boxing in Idaho, or <br/>
just dreaming of that special Idaho boxing moment please, please, <br/>
please check and double check your clues and print right before <br/>
heading out as change will be constant over the next several months.  <br/>
If you are coming to Boise we would love to have you visit!<br/>
<br/>
I will also post on here the boxes I am checking and their status.  <br/>
Some I may replace, some I may relocate and some I may retire <br/>
depending on what I find and the level of activity the box has seen.  <br/>
