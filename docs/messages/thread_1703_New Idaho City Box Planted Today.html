I was able to get a letterbox ready to roll this morning and we made time to plant it in Pioneer Cemetery.  If you are up that direction make sure to visit "Choir of One" http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=114784  and the "The Boy Who Pet Bees" planted by XSG - http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=81580  Both boxes are alive (no pun intended) and well at Pioneer Cemetery.<br/>
