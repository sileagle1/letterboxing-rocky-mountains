surprised to see that one get accidentally found. It was hidden <br/>
really well and I know they didn't solve the clues; they are pretty <br/>

looking for a place to hide something and came upon the letterbox in <br/>
it's nook. Strangely, we share a desire for secret places with some <br/>

journal entry in a geocache I found once. It was "hiding" behind a <br/>

my own. But if there had been some finders' stamps in the log I would <br/>
be a lot more upset. I know I have heard it on this list before, but <br/>
it's the log with everyone's stamp that is most valuable.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry to hear one of your boxes got vandalized.  It is<br/>
easier for me to accept when somebody finds mine and<br/>
throws it away thinking it is trash, but to just destroy<br/>
something confounds me.  I, too am surprised when some<br/>
of my boxes are accidentally found, especially when they<br/>
are hidden really well.  Sometimes it is because the last<br/>
finder did not rehide it well, but sometimes it is because<br/>
an animal found it and left it in the open for someone to see.<br/>
Either way, losing a box is hard, especially if it is far<br/>
away and I can't replace it easily.  And like you say, the<br/>
log is lost forever.  Glad you will be replacing it since<br/>
I hope to look for your boxes next time I get to your area.<br/>
