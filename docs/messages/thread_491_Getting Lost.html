Yes, having Harrison Ford find you when you are lost.....sounds like <br/>
a good idea to me.   On a more serious note, however, I saw a great <br/>
pirate stamp when I went Letterboxing in Oklahoma City with my <br/>
sister...It is in Midwest City, Oklahoma and it is in six pieces.  <br/>
Each stamp comes together to make a great picture of a pirate. The <br/>
carver explaines it a little on the clues.  It was a lot of fun.  <br/>

...would rather be found by Colin Farrell but wouldn't complain too much about Harrison either.  <br/>

I am going to try and ease the itch by starting to scribble on some new designs for future plants today I think.<br/>
