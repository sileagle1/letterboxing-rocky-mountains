<br/>
My daughter (VolcanicAsh101, age 14) and I (Altchar, age to be left to <br/>
ones imagination) are visiting the Denver area from Tallahassee over <br/>
Thanksgiving.  This will be our first time in the area and we hope to <br/>
get in some great boxing (and maybe some exchanges, if anyone wants).  <br/>
I know it's only August, but we just got confirmation and we're excited.<br/>
<br/>
Please send suggestions for quick trips, drive-bys or particularly <br/>
special boxes.  We're staying with a non-boxer friend, so don't want to <br/>
plan day long hikes or anything, as that might be considered rude - <br/>
although I will try to convert him.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, if we plant a box or two in the area, would anyone volunteer to <br/>
adopt them for maintainance purposes?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!!  If you prefer to reply off-listserv, my email is <br/>

<br/>
I'm actually flying in Tgiving night, and leaving on the 28th.  We'll be in<br/>
Denver proper, on S. Raleigh St.  I'm collecting some cool clues (and some<br/>
of your that are PFX limited, I think J ).  I may be bringing a stamp or two<br/>
to plant for the CFLLB group too (Central Florida Letterboxing).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll let you know more as we get closer.  I would love to meet up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Mile Hiya Back at ya Altchar!<br/>
<br/>
The "Denver area" is kinda big. Do you have anymore information to <br/>
share about where you'll be based? That'd help heaps to begin to <br/>
suggest boxes, which I'm happy to do with a tad more info....esp viz <br/>
dates...IF you'll be in the area before/after the actual holiday <br/>
weekend, by chance.<br/>
<br/>
I'm in Denver proper, and if I'm around would LOVE to meet for <br/>
exchanges. However, having just spent lots of time with my family in <br/>
the Pacific NW for vacation, I doubt I'll be doing "family stuff" <br/>
but I just MIGHT be taking advantage of a paid 4-day weekend....to <br/>
head out town to do some boxing...dunno yet.<br/>
<br/>
Please stay in touch as the time gets closer and I'll do what I can <br/>
to suggest boxes/etc/etal...on or off list. I've been the <br/>
instigator for PREvious informal meets and greets before, but that's <br/>
gonna be a toughy weekend (probably) to get a "posse" together to <br/>
meet ya..I could be wrong...<br/>
