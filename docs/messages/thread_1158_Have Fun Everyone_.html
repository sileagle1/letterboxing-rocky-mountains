                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I just got back in town from a family reunion in Virginia for <br/>
the last week. I had hoped to maybe sneak over to the gathering, but <br/>
can't, sniff sniff.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, however, I did get to go boxing on a couple of <br/>
afternoons with my sister and neice who live and box in MA and GA! We <br/>
hit over a dozen boxes, and only came home with 5 new finds! And, of <br/>
those finds, only 2 were handmade, and, the storebought stamps had <br/>
nothing to do with the beautiful spots they were hidden in! DOH! In <br/>
other words, I applaud the efforts and beauty of the boxes our area <br/>
boxers have hidden! It was interesting out there, we found 2 boxes in <br/>
the Shenandoah National Park and they were visited fairly regularly. I <br/>
wonder if the rangers allow it, or do they know about letterboxing, <br/>
hmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to see the gathering pictures!<br/>

looking under rocks and eating fine pies!<br/>
<br/>
Have a moment of silence and possibily something with merinque on it <br/>
for those of us who can't attend. <br/>

(Although we DID have the great pleasure of seeing the Catamount <br/>
Carvers this week!  And the superb event stamps!)<br/>

Es, saluting all the inky fingers that will be there tomorrow night<br/>
