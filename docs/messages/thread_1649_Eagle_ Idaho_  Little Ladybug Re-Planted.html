hiding hole that was becoming too small with each passing day.  Also I <br/>
noted that the old log book was smelling a bit funky!  Today I re-<br/>
carved the Little Lady Bug and placed it in a new container in the same <br/>
tree but at the base instead of in the tiny hole.  This carving is <br/>
brand new and does not look anything like the original Little Lady Bug <br/>
so I would encourage boxers who have visited in the past to visit <br/>
again.  <br/>
