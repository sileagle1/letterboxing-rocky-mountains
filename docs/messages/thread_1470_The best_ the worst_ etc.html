<br>
Some friends of ours got us hooked on LBs 4 years ago.  They took the <br>
concept a step further and included photos (pics of the boxes, the <br>
surroundings, people who were LBing with them, etc.)We also have been <br>
doing that and I have then put them in 8x8 scrapbooks. <br>
<br>
Is anyone interested in doing some "the best site I have been to", "the <br>
worst, the most dangerous, the most..."?<br>
