                    <div class="plaintext-content">New notes from my sister below.  I will update the clues officially <br>
tomorrow or the next day.  She has never letterboxed before so this <br>
is her first time helping with clues.  Sorry that Dixie Peach had <br>
trouble with the first attempt.<br>
<br>
Note From Sister:<br>
<br>
It is a glorious New Year's Eve day in Colorado. It's over 60 <br>
degrees and sunny! I just got back from checking in on the <br>
letterbox. It is there, although it was a little difficult for me to <br>
find than I thought it would be. Since I took notes along the way <br>
the first time, when planting the letterbox, I thought they must be <br>
clear. Once I actually used them to find the box the second time, I <br>
realize that they could be more clear. I've included additional <br>
detail or modifications. Please give my apologies to the letterboxer <br>
who had a tough time finding the letterbox. I can easily see why she <br>
had a hard time finding it. I too saw the cluster of rocks that she <br>
was talking about, which would have made my initial instructions <br>
confusing. Hopefully these are better. Also, as I looked again at <br>
where the letterbox is, I can't imagine that wildlife could get to <br>
it, although, it is just off a little deer trail. I don't think a <br>
human could find it either, unless they had the instructions below, <br>
so hopefully it will be kept safe and will be easier to find with <br>
the below instructions. Happy New Year!<br>
<br>
Getting There<br>
<br>
Take 6th Avenue to Indiana <br>
Go South on Indiana to West 6th Avenue Service Road. <br>
Take a Left on West 6th Avenue Service Road. <br>
Take a Right on Arbutus, same road for Red Rocks Community College. <br>
At 1st Roundabout, take a Left and continue on Arbutus. You will <br>
pass a cutoff called "Campus Loop" in the roundabout to get to the <br>
Arbutus cutoff. <br>
At 2nd Roundabout, take a Right to Warren Tech school. The road is <br>
also called "Campus Loop". <br>
The trail head is across from the Warren Tech school, where the sign <br>
says "No Motorized Vehicles". <br>
I'm not sure the best place to park without being towed, so please <br>
do use your best judgment. <br>
 <br>
<br>
Hiking<br>
<br>
Follow the narrow path for a while. <br>
Path has branches to the right, but keep going straight/left, until <br>
you come to somewhat of a fork in the road. To the left, you will <br>
see that the trail goes into a neighborhood. You will want to head <br>
right at this juncture. <br>
<br>
The path widens to somewhat of a dirt road  follow this (it curves <br>
a bit to the left) until you see the water tank. <br>
Take a right, just before the red fire hydrant. <br>
The path goes up the hill to the left. <br>
<br>
Once you get to the top of the 1st hill, it plateaus. Soak in the <br>
panoramic views, then look to the South. <br>
There are a series of hills, but we're going to the top of this 1st <br>
one. Continue on the path at the top of this plateau until you reach <br>
a fork. The main path continues to the left of this hill with <br>
virtually no incline. Straight ahead is a steep path going to the <br>
top of this hill. Stop. <br>
<br>
Getting your bearings: At this point, the steep path is to the South <br>
of the water tank and SouthWest of Downtown Denver. You can look <br>
down on the water tank. There is a path to the right, another path <br>
to the left, and a path in the middle. We are taking the middle <br>
path, which looks like the road less traveled because it looks like <br>
the steepest path in this area. <br>
<br>
Take the steep path. As you start up this path, you'll notice a <br>
cluster of grey, sharp shrubs that look dormant or dead. They are on <br>
both the right and left hand side of the path. Continue going past <br>
these shrubs. As you look up the hill, you'll notice that there is a <br>
large open area of wild grass on the hill. Continue to the point <br>
where the shrubs are on both the right and left hand side of the <br>
trail again. Stop here. Look to the right, where the dead-looking <br>
grey shrubs start up again. About one or two paces in, at the second <br>
shrub, you'll see a cluster of rocks. The letterbox is buried <br>
underneath these rocks. There is a cluster of large and small rocks <br>
on top of the letterbox, although most are medium to large size <br>
rocks. It is not obvious that a letterbox would necessarily be here, <br>
so you will want to turn over a number of rocks to be sure to find <br>
it.   <br>
<br>
Be sure to continue to the top of this hill, roughly 50 long and 70 <br>
short paces away, to soak in the panoramic views. I had counted 50 <br>
longer paces when climbing from the letterbox to the top of the <br>
hill. I then counted roughly 70 paces from the top of the hill down <br>
to the letterbox. The differential is that the trail is steep, so my <br>
paces were pretty short paces when coming down the hill. From the <br>
top of the hill, you can continue on this trail, or follow your <br>
steps back to the trailhead. <br>
