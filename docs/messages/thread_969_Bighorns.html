                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi folks, the Symbols of Colorado Series just didn't feel complete <br>
without the state animal, the bighorn sheep.  I had carved a stamp <br>
some time back from a photo we took of some bighorns, and it's been <br>
burning a hole in my backpack ever since waiting for the JeLy family <br>
to get to a place where one might actually SEE bighorns.  Well, we <br>
returned to the scene of the crime today, back near where we took the <br>
picture in the first place, and I finally left the box, SOC #6: <br>
Bighorns.  Since I've been so hard on y'all of late, this is an easy <br>
one, easy clues and a short hike.  Enjoy:<br>
