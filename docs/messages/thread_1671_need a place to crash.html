We are traveling on an extreme shoestring budget, and wondered if there were any letterboxers able and willing to help us in the way of free lodging. We will have with us a tent, as well as a pair of army-style cots, so we could use either floorspace for the cots, or yard space for our tent. We plan to be only one night in each place (except for the two nights we're spending in the dorms in St. Louis. Our need is for places to park/camp for a single overnight while in transit. Any nights we can't be with letterboxers, we will be looking for free/cheap camping places, so recommendations in your areas will be as valuable and welcome as offers of places to sleep. We plan to provide all our own food and needs, we're only looking for space from those who are willing and able to help out.<br/>
<br/>
Our proposed itinerary of where we're sleeping is:<br/>
<br/>
Tues 7/14 Albuquerque, NM<br/>
Wed 7/15 Oklahoma City, OK<br/>
Thu 7/16 Tulsa, OK<br/>
Fri &amp; Sat 7/17 &amp; 7/18 St Louis, U of M Dorms<br/>
Sun 7/19 Omaha, NE<br/>
Mon 7/20 Rapid City, SD<br/>
Tue 7/21 Denver, CO<br/>
Wed 7/22 Durango, CO<br/>
Thu 7/23 Flagstaff, AZ<br/>
Fri 7/24 Home in Gilbert, AZ<br/>
<br/>
We have planned for about 8 hours of driving, and lots of stops for letterboxing along the way on each day. Yeah, I know it's not that far between Oklahoma City and Tulsa, but there were more extracurriculars in those two cities, and we wanted to make sure we had time for all the things we wanted to see there.<br/>
<br/>
The locations could be moved a little, if necessary. The schedule is more flexible after LB Con than before. We absolutely have to be home by Saturday evening on the 25th, though. The reason I'm asking so early is so we can make reservations at campgrounds, if necessary...<br/>

Heart Writer and I will be Driving to LB Con this summer, and doing a little sight-seeing here and there along the way. We are traveling on an extreme shoestring budget, and wondered if there were any letterboxers able and willing to help us in the way of free lodging. We will have with us a tent, as well as a pair of army-style cots, so we could use either floorspace for the cots, or yard space for our tent. We plan to be only one night in each place (except for the two nights we're spending in the dorms in St. Louis. Our need is for places to park/camp for a single overnight while in transit. Any nights we can't be with letterboxers, we will be looking for free/cheap camping places, so recommendations in your areas will be as valuable and welcome as offers of places to sleep.
