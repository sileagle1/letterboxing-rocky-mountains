I have been wanting to ask you if you wanted to do this because I <br>
know you're interested! I vote YES! I think it would ROCK to get <br>
together and hike to this box as a group!<br>
After we solve the puzzles, of course. LOL<br>
<br>
Woot!<br>
<br>
I haven't even read the rest of the notes yet (been on vacation) but <br>
got so excited I had to jump right in with my yes vote!!<br>
<br>
Esmerelda, oh yes, it will be our's....<br>
