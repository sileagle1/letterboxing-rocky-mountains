                    <div class="plaintext-content">That is really interesting.  I hadn't heard of that, but it makes<br>
pretty good sense.  Here in ID they still don't charge for rescues,<br>
but I think they have considered it.<br>
<br>
by the way, I got an email today from CW Sunseeker.  She is back in<br>
AZ, we'll see how long she stays there before moving again.  Her<br>
husband's work takes them all over.  Anyway, she said the compass that<br>
was left at a letterbox is an inexpensive one and she already bought a<br>
replacement.  So if anyone wants a new compass.  It is up for grabs.<br>
She said thanks for the thoughtfulness though.<br>
