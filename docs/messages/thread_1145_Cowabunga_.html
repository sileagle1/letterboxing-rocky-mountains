delights and amooooses me, so I made a temporary box for it.  And <br>
right here is the only place to get the cluuuuuuuuues.<br>
<br>
This box will disappear on October 19th and probably find a new <br>
life ...perhaps as a traveler, a postal box, cootie, or to a new <br>
hiding spot, since I know only a handful of you will be able to <br>
mooooove yourselves to Denver for this wonderfully creative urban art <br>
project (oh yeah and a letterbox!)<br>
<br>
After I pull the box on 10/19 but before its next In Cow Nation ...if <br>
you should happen to meat me on the trail, and I have this box on <br>
me ...say Cowabunga! for this hand carved stamp...one of my faves, so <br>
far.  (Log handmade too - no ink or pen in box.)<br>

Find Aspen Eyes.  2 cement squares towards the closest street from the <br>
back right leg.  Look under, on the side by the drain.  <br>
<br>
Wrapped in the same color as the pole and the dark space for <br>
camouflage not waterproofness.  Please note how it's wrapped before <br>
opening and note that the contents are really jammed into this <br>
oversized altoid-like box.  Please - be discreet and rehide sooper, <br>
dooper well or I'll come to your house "Cow Patty" your lawn and <br>
shubbery...<br>
<br>
This is a pretty low key place to hang out to wait for your snagging <br>
moment at all times of day....Number of people around will vary, <br>
however.<br>

Parking not great in this area, but remember the 16th Street Mall <br>

My 5 year-old was delighted to retrieve the box after we "accidentally" dropped a sweater next to the hiding place as cover. We had a wonderful time, and we never would have made it down there without your box as incentive. Great urban location!!! Thanks!<br>

If by any chance you plan on hunting them down on that specific <br>

Thank you so much for this AWESOME box!  And the stamp is soooooo<br>
adorable!  My 5 year old ended up debating a 12 year old regarding the<br>
sex of Aspen Eyes.  Not sure there was ever a conculusion as s/he has<br>
horns AND udders!  We are total city slickers! <br>
<br>
I would encourage everyone to make time to head out for this great<br>
find, we had so much fun taking pictures of all the cows on parade<br>
along the way.<br>
