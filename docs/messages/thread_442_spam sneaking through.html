Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I haven't been able to get into the site as much as I would like and <br/>
I had missed the fact that several things of spam had slipped <br/>
through.  Sorry about that.  We try to get it right away, but we have <br/>
been lucky enough to not have to do much moderation yet.  There are <br/>
up sides and down sides to that.  The upside is less control and <br/>
immediate access to new members.  The downside is an occasional email <br/>
we don't want.  I have banned the members that posted the spam and <br/>
deleted the ones I found.  Hopefully this will help some.<br/>
<br/>
Have a wonderful Christmas!!<br/>
Cadenza<br/>
