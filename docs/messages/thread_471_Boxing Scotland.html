Hi folks, happy holidays!  Princess Tulip, goddess and myself are <br>
going to Scotland in the spring, and when I asked goddess what she <br>
wanted to do there, the first thing she said was letterboxing.  I <br>
knew it was a smart move marrying her.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I vaguely remember some discussion on this board about some <br>
exchanges with 'boxers in Scotland.  I was hoping some of you kind <br>
souls could point me to letterboxing resources and more importantly <br>
CLUES in the land of tartans.  Any ideas?<br>

She probably is on the big list/but is definately on another list I am on.<br>
Should I tell her you are interested in a possible exchange and give her your email?  I dont remember where she lives in Scotland.<br>

If you could put me in touch with her, I'd appreciate it.  I don't <br>
know yet about an exhange, we're still not sure what parts of the <br>
country we are going to be in.  What I am looking for right now is <br>
where to find clues to Scotland letterboxes so we can plan some <br>
boxes into our trip.  OK, so we can plan our trip around some <br>
letterboxes.  There, I said it.  Why are you looking at me that <br>
way?  You know you plan your trips that way too....<br>
