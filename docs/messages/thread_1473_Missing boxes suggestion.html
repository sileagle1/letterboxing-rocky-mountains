I second the motion here.  When you are working on a list of all letterboxes in an area, it is tough when every other box you click on states that it is missing.<br/>

<br/>
Great Idea Claudey!<br/>

I was wondering if I could make a friendly suggestion that maybe we can encourage our <br/>
members to do a little pre-spring cleaning on the letterboxing lists... I noticed that there are <br/>
several boxes listed on both sites that have been missing for over 2 years. Perhaps the <br/>
owners could either archive them to keep them from showing up in searches, or replace <br/>
them. I know it's hard when you have missing boxes out of town from where you are, but I'm <br/>
sure that members living in those cites would be more than willing to help replace them, <br/>
myself included! I hope no one takes offense at this suggestion. I just know that I was <br/>
frustrated when I did a search for boxes in a particular city, only to find that 1/3 of the listed <br/>
boxes were MIA. Not frustrated at the placers, mind you—those dirty rotten thieves who took <br/>
them! Still, it would be nice if the list only showed active boxes, or boxes that will be <br/>
replaced in a month or 2. Just my 2¢.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It has taken me a whole lot of boxes (and a lengthy trip into CA) to <br/>
figure this out, but there are several suggestions I have for the <br/>
frustrating "no box" situation. Probably this is old news to seasoned <br/>
LBers, but hopefully it will help the newbies.  First of all, when I <br/>
go onto the LB North America site and get to the state I am looking <br/>
for, I go to the top and hit the "sort by placement date" selection.  <br/>
This allows me to see the most recent boxes.  For boxes tht are not <br/>
as new I always check the clue page and/or the membership page to see <br/>
when the last found date was.  I then can make a decision as to <br/>
whether or not I want to take a chance at a particular box. <br/>
<br/>
 I was rather surprised to find that this was not covered in Randy <br/>
Hall's book-it would sure make it less frustrating for those just <br/>
starting out.<br/>
