                    <div class="plaintext-content">Pretty quiet on the list. Here's a story: I went up to the high <br/>
country for a hike and persuaded my companion to check on my Engineer <br/>
Mountain Box with me. The trail was 90 percent still covered in snow. <br/>
The three foot tall stumps in the clues are still completely buried. <br/>
I think it will be a while before that trail is ready for much <br/>
action. <br/>
<br/>
This means that the creeks will be full, the flowers big, and the <br/>
bears will have something to eat this year. Much rejoicing around <br/>
here after many dry years!<br/>
