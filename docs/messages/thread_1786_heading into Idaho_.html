Our family is venturing into Idaho and we plan on taking 2 different routes there and back to make the most of our LB experiences!!!  I can't wait to see how we come out of it.  We'll be hitting Salmon, Idaho Falls, Twin Falls, Kuna, Craters of the Moon and a lot in between.  Hoping to hide a few more as well.<br>
