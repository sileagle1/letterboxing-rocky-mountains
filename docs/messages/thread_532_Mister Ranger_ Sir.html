I just did a for real laugh out loud thinking of letterboxers ripping <br>
up the stair to find the box!  Sounds like animals to me, too. <br>
Although my mother tried to pull an iron fence out of the ground <br>
once, because she was SURE the box was under it.  Fortunately she's a <br>
wimpy old lady and couldn't do more than jiggle it before I wrestled <br>
her to the ground. <br>
<br>
I hope they don't get ahold of a mean ranger who tells them that <br>
we're all evil.  If they get one of the good ones you'll be set!  And <br>
then we can have another celebration.  I'll order the pies now. <br>

Oh, now I'm laughing! Poor old mom, I have this vision of Es, <br>
pinning down mom, makin' her behave! As for those rangers, they can <br>
have their ole coastline right there. There's plenty of open <br>
coastline where I can hide boxes and thumb my nose at the law.<br>
