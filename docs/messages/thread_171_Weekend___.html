If you are referring to the proposed meet/greet that I was dreamin' <br>
about, then no, not this weekend.  I didn't get enough replies so it <br>
keeled over and died.  I didn't rush to plan one as I want it to be <br>
nicely done and have a big group attend - schedules permitting - <br>
can't make everyone happy.  Thoughts???  Perhaps I should just plan <br>
it, post it and deal with it.  April is looking very promising!  <br>
I'll keep everyone posted!  <br>
<br>
Oh, I saw your stamp in some boxes last weekend!  Happy boxing!<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
