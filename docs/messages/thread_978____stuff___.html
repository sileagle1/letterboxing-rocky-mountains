                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello boys and girls out there in letterbox land.  Got a question <br>
for you.  Today, team JeLyBean loaded up the candy wagon and headed <br>
out for a 'boxing extravaganza.  We found six today (why, thank you) <br>
but four of the six had ...stuff... in them beyond the standard <br>
stamp and logbook.  By ...stuff... I mean the kind of things one <br>
typically finds in a geocache.<br>
<br>
(Short aside for those of you unfamiliar with geocaching: it's a lot <br>
like letterboxing except you use GPS coordinates to find the box, <br>
and instead of a stamp, the box is full of ...stuff...  You bring <br>
your own ...stuff... and take one of the pieces of ...stuff... out <br>
of the geocache and leave one of your own pieces of ...stuff... <br>
Other than that, it's very similar to letterboxing.  Except we are <br>
much more cool.  Aside over.)<br>
<br>
Anyway, here's the question.  If you run into this kind <br>
of ...stuff... what do you do with it?  Here's the reason I'm <br>
asking.  In my experience, geocachers are not always familiar with <br>
letterboxing and how we play our game.  Owing to the relative <br>
imprecision of GPS devices, geocachers often show up in an area and <br>
begin hunting around for a likely spot to hide a geocache.  They are <br>
not aided by letterboxing clues like "look under the pile of rocks <br>
at the base of the big tree."  Because both letterboxers and <br>
geocachers tend to place their boxes in cool areas, there is often a <br>
letterbox and geocache near each other.  Often, geocachers will find <br>
the letterbox by mistake and think it is the geocache they were <br>
searching for.  The will then open the box and be immediately <br>
disappointed at the lack of ...stuff...  They will fall into one of <br>
two categories: 1) the kind that will look through the journal, <br>
realize the stamp in the box may have something to do with the <br>
stamps in the journal, think that this may not exactly be a <br>
geocache, sign in pen or pencil and leave, or 2) the kind that will <br>
think the stamp is the ...stuff... they were looking for, take the <br>
stamp and leave some other ...stuff...<br>
<br>
It's the latter of these that concerns me.  On more than one <br>
occasion, I have come to a letterbox with no stamp, but does contain <br>
a plastic alligator or wooden nickle.  I then know that a category 2 <br>
geocacher has been there.  Because of this, I now write on the lid <br>
of all my boxes "This is not a geocache."<br>
<br>
Anyway, when I see ...stuff... in a letterbox I get worried that <br>
geocachers are thinking the letterbox is the geocache and it is only <br>
a matter of time until the stamp disappears and is replaced by Mardi <br>
Gras beads.<br>
<br>
So, what do you do with the ...stuff... take it out, leave it, or <br>
other?<br>

Having come across this scenario SEVERAL times in my recent Road Trip<br>

in my "spiel" identifying my Placed box, I say, (and I KNOW it <br>
sounds kurt and I apologize in advance) but I say "enjoy the <br>
contents, etc/etal...and..."remove NOTHING...along with "replace <br>
EXACTLY where found", and yes in caps....<br>
<br>
and since I did my PREsearch for months before starting boxing, I <br>
learned quickly about geocaching.....I personally also decide to <br>
TAKE nada either...It's a diffent game....<br>
<br>
I debated, but then decided against adding text which said "This is <br>
NOT a GEOCACHE" but decided, again as a newbie, this was just beyond <br>
rude-sounding.....<br>
<br>
Maybe I was wrong/it's time for Boxers to add this?<br>
<br>
Dunno but I DO get what your saying Jely....if a newbie like <br>
me "gets" what you're saying....well it might be time?<br>

Little Raven is close to my house.  It was one of the first LBs that I found when I started LBing in September and there was no "stuff" in it when I found it.  <br>
<br>
If you would like me to check on it or remove "stuff", just let me know.  I could put a "this is not a geocache" note in it for you too.  There's only a light dusting of snow here today, a big change from the gorgeous day yesterday.<br>

<br>
I think Little Raven is probably safe from geocachers... that was <br>
such a random location for a placement I can't imagine anyone having <br>
a cache nearby!  I was mostly curious to see who had been up there <br>
visiting yesterday!<br>
<br>
I really appreciate the offer, though!<br>
<br>
You must be fairly close to Buffalo Bill, too.  What a lovely area to <br>
live in!<br>
<br>
Es, who doesn't mean it to sound like they're evil when she <br>
says, 'safe from geocachers'<br>

  Hello boys and girls out there in letterbox land.  Got a question <br>
for you.  Today, team JeLyBean loaded up the candy wagon and headed <br>
out for a 'boxing extravaganza.  We found six today (why, thank you) <br>
but four of the six had ...stuff... in them beyond the standard <br>
stamp and logbook.  By ...stuff... I mean the kind of things one <br>
typically finds in a geocache.<br>
<br>
(Short aside for those of you unfamiliar with geocaching: it's a lot <br>
like letterboxing except you use GPS coordinates to find the box, <br>
and instead of a stamp, the box is full of ...stuff...  You bring <br>
your own ...stuff... and take one of the pieces of ...stuff... out <br>
of the geocache and leave one of your own pieces of ...stuff... <br>
Other than that, it's very similar to letterboxing.  Except we are <br>
much more cool.  Aside over.)<br>
<br>
Anyway, here's the question.  If you run into this kind <br>
of ...stuff... what do you do with it?  Here's the reason I'm <br>
asking.  In my experience, geocachers are not always familiar with <br>
letterboxing and how we play our game.  Owing to the relative <br>
imprecision of GPS devices, geocachers often show up in an area and <br>
begin hunting around for a likely spot to hide a geocache.  They are <br>
not aided by letterboxing clues like "look under the pile of rocks <br>
at the base of the big tree."  Because both letterboxers and <br>
geocachers tend to place their boxes in cool areas, there is often a <br>
letterbox and geocache near each other.  Often, geocachers will find <br>
the letterbox by mistake and think it is the geocache they were <br>
searching for.  The will then open the box and be immediately <br>
disappointed at the lack of ...stuff...  They will fall into one of <br>
two categories: 1) the kind that will look through the journal, <br>
realize the stamp in the box may have something to do with the <br>
stamps in the journal, think that this may not exactly be a <br>
geocache, sign in pen or pencil and leave, or 2) the kind that will <br>
think the stamp is the ...stuff... they were looking for, take the <br>
stamp and leave some other ...stuff...<br>
<br>
It's the latter of these that concerns me.  On more than one <br>
occasion, I have come to a letterbox with no stamp, but does contain <br>
a plastic alligator or wooden nickle.  I then know that a category 2 <br>
geocacher has been there.  Because of this, I now write on the lid <br>
of all my boxes "This is not a geocache."<br>
<br>
Anyway, when I see ...stuff... in a letterbox I get worried that <br>
geocachers are thinking the letterbox is the geocache and it is only <br>
a matter of time until the stamp disappears and is replaced by Mardi <br>
Gras beads.<br>
<br>
So, what do you do with the ...stuff... take it out, leave it, or <br>
other?<br>
<br>
'Box Happy... and don't take the stamp,<br>

Have you found that one to recognize the area?  If you are around, I<br>
wouldn't mind an update, but I don't need people to go too far out of the<br>
way.  I actually think that one might be higher in snow.  It would likely<br>
have to wait till spring.<br>
