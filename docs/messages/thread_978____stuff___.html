                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello boys and girls out there in letterbox land.  Got a question <br/>
for you.  Today, team JeLyBean loaded up the candy wagon and headed <br/>
out for a 'boxing extravaganza.  We found six today (why, thank you) <br/>
but four of the six had ...stuff... in them beyond the standard <br/>
stamp and logbook.  By ...stuff... I mean the kind of things one <br/>
typically finds in a geocache.<br/>
<br/>
(Short aside for those of you unfamiliar with geocaching: it's a lot <br/>
like letterboxing except you use GPS coordinates to find the box, <br/>
and instead of a stamp, the box is full of ...stuff...  You bring <br/>
your own ...stuff... and take one of the pieces of ...stuff... out <br/>
of the geocache and leave one of your own pieces of ...stuff... <br/>
Other than that, it's very similar to letterboxing.  Except we are <br/>
much more cool.  Aside over.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here's the question.  If you run into this kind <br/>
of ...stuff... what do you do with it?  Here's the reason I'm <br/>
asking.  In my experience, geocachers are not always familiar with <br/>
letterboxing and how we play our game.  Owing to the relative <br/>
imprecision of GPS devices, geocachers often show up in an area and <br/>
begin hunting around for a likely spot to hide a geocache.  They are <br/>
not aided by letterboxing clues like "look under the pile of rocks <br/>
at the base of the big tree."  Because both letterboxers and <br/>
geocachers tend to place their boxes in cool areas, there is often a <br/>
letterbox and geocache near each other.  Often, geocachers will find <br/>
the letterbox by mistake and think it is the geocache they were <br/>
searching for.  The will then open the box and be immediately <br/>
disappointed at the lack of ...stuff...  They will fall into one of <br/>
two categories: 1) the kind that will look through the journal, <br/>
realize the stamp in the box may have something to do with the <br/>
stamps in the journal, think that this may not exactly be a <br/>
geocache, sign in pen or pencil and leave, or 2) the kind that will <br/>
think the stamp is the ...stuff... they were looking for, take the <br/>
stamp and leave some other ...stuff...<br/>
<br/>
It's the latter of these that concerns me.  On more than one <br/>
occasion, I have come to a letterbox with no stamp, but does contain <br/>
a plastic alligator or wooden nickle.  I then know that a category 2 <br/>
geocacher has been there.  Because of this, I now write on the lid <br/>
of all my boxes "This is not a geocache."<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when I see ...stuff... in a letterbox I get worried that <br/>
geocachers are thinking the letterbox is the geocache and it is only <br/>
a matter of time until the stamp disappears and is replaced by Mardi <br/>
Gras beads.<br/>
<br/>
So, what do you do with the ...stuff... take it out, leave it, or <br/>
other?<br/>

Having come across this scenario SEVERAL times in my recent Road Trip<br/>

in my "spiel" identifying my Placed box, I say, (and I KNOW it <br/>
sounds kurt and I apologize in advance) but I say "enjoy the <br/>
contents, etc/etal...and..."remove NOTHING...along with "replace <br/>
EXACTLY where found", and yes in caps....<br/>
<br/>
and since I did my PREsearch for months before starting boxing, I <br/>
learned quickly about geocaching.....I personally also decide to <br/>
TAKE nada either...It's a diffent game....<br/>
<br/>
I debated, but then decided against adding text which said "This is <br/>
NOT a GEOCACHE" but decided, again as a newbie, this was just beyond <br/>
rude-sounding.....<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I was wrong/it's time for Boxers to add this?<br/>
<br/>
Dunno but I DO get what your saying Jely....if a newbie like <br/>
me "gets" what you're saying....well it might be time?<br/>

Little Raven is close to my house.  It was one of the first LBs that I found when I started LBing in September and there was no "stuff" in it when I found it.  <br/>
<br/>
If you would like me to check on it or remove "stuff", just let me know.  I could put a "this is not a geocache" note in it for you too.  There's only a light dusting of snow here today, a big change from the gorgeous day yesterday.<br/>

&gt; &gt; of the geocache and leave one of your own pieces of ...stuff... <br/>
&gt; &gt; Other than that, it's very similar to letterboxing. Except we are <br/>
&gt; &gt; much more cool. Aside over.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, here's the question. If you run into this kind <br/>
&gt; &gt; of ...stuff... what do you do with it? Here's the reason I'm <br/>
&gt; &gt; asking. In my experience, geocachers are not always familiar with <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing and how we play our game. Owing to the relative <br/>
&gt; &gt; imprecision of GPS devices, geocachers often show up in an area and <br/>
&gt; &gt; begin hunting around for a likely spot to hide a geocache. They <br/>
&gt; are <br/>
&gt; &gt; not aided by letterboxing clues like "look under the pile of rocks <br/>
&gt; &gt; at the base of the big tree." Because both letterboxers and <br/>
&gt; &gt; geocachers tend to place their boxes in cool areas, there is often <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox and geocache near each other. Often, geocachers will <br/>
&gt; find <br/>
&gt; &gt; the letterbox by mistake and think it is the geocache they were <br/>
&gt; &gt; searching for. The will then open the box and be immediately <br/>
&gt; &gt; disappointed at the lack of ...stuff... They will fall into one of <br/>
&gt; &gt; two categories: 1) the kind that will look through the journal, <br/>
&gt; &gt; realize the stamp in the box may have something to do with the <br/>
&gt; &gt; stamps in the journal, think that this may not exactly be a <br/>
&gt; &gt; geocache, sign in pen or pencil and leave, or 2) the kind that will <br/>
&gt; &gt; think the stamp is the ...stuff... they were looking for, take the <br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp and leave some other ...stuff...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It's the latter of these that concerns me. On more than one <br/>
&gt; &gt; occasion, I have come to a letterbox with no stamp, but does <br/>
&gt; contain <br/>
&gt; &gt; a plastic alligator or wooden nickle. I then know that a category <br/>
&gt; 2 <br/>
&gt; &gt; geocacher has been there. Because of this, I now write on the lid <br/>
&gt; &gt; of all my boxes "This is not a geocache."<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, when I see ...stuff... in a letterbox I get worried that <br/>
&gt; &gt; geocachers are thinking the letterbox is the geocache and it is <br/>
&gt; only <br/>
&gt; &gt; a matter of time until the stamp disappears and is replaced by <br/>
&gt; Mardi <br/>
&gt; &gt; Gras beads.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So, what do you do with the ...stuff... take it out, leave it, or <br/>
&gt; &gt; other?<br/>

<br/>
I think Little Raven is probably safe from geocachers... that was <br/>
such a random location for a placement I can't imagine anyone having <br/>
a cache nearby!  I was mostly curious to see who had been up there <br/>
visiting yesterday!<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate the offer, though!<br/>
<br/>
You must be fairly close to Buffalo Bill, too.  What a lovely area to <br/>
live in!<br/>
<br/>
Es, who doesn't mean it to sound like they're evil when she <br/>
says, 'safe from geocachers'<br/>

&gt; Little Raven is close to my house.  It was one of the first LBs <br/>
that I found when I started LBing in September and there was <br/>
no "stuff" in it when I found it.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you would like me to check on it or remove "stuff", just let me <br/>
know.  I could put a "this is not a geocache" note in it for you <br/>
too.  There's only a light dusting of snow here today, a big change <br/>
from the gorgeous day yesterday.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Speaking for myself, if I were checking up on one of my own boxes <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; found... stuff ... in it, I would remove it and either write on <br/>
it or <br/>
&gt; &gt; leave a note in it, This is not a geocache! I'm not totally sure <br/>
&gt; &gt; about someone else's box. I think I would leave the .. stuff .. <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; put a note in to any future cachers. I did find a box in the <br/>
Springs <br/>
&gt; &gt; area that had the stamp missing and a bunch of .. stuff .. in it. <br/>
&gt; &gt; All that hiking and nothing but .. stuff .. ! <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My 'Spacious Skies' box on Grand Mesa has a cache just a few feet <br/>
&gt; &gt; away. I know because we all looked at it last summer during the <br/>
&gt; &gt; festivities of Boxtemberfest! But it is *so* obvious and mine is <br/>
so <br/>
&gt; &gt; not obvious, that, so far, I haven't had any problems. Of course, <br/>
&gt; &gt; it's under about 5 feet of snow right now, so, well, there you <br/>
go. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And, having said that.. if any of y'all ever visit one of my <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; My opinion is I would take the stuff out to discourage future <br/>
&gt; &gt; mistakes. Maybe look nearby to see if you find another geocache <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; deposit the stuff in there. At Fox Run we were spotted by some <br/>
&gt; &gt; geocahers and their kids came running up to us and I had to <br/>
explain <br/>
&gt; &gt; to them the difference. They were not very excited to know we <br/>
only <br/>
&gt; &gt; got to stamp but then I wouldn't want their tras..er... stuff <br/>
either! <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree that we need to put it in plain letters. NOT a <br/>
&gt; &gt; geocache!!! <br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello boys and girls out there in letterbox land.  Got a question<br/>
&gt; &gt; for you.  Today, team JeLyBean loaded up the candy wagon and headed<br/>
&gt; &gt; out for a 'boxing extravaganza.  We found six today (why, thank you)<br/>
&gt; &gt; but four of the six had ...stuff... in them beyond the standard<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp and logbook.  By ...stuff... I mean the kind of things one<br/>

&gt; &gt; (Short aside for those of you unfamiliar with geocaching: it's a lot<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, here's the question.  If you run into this kind<br/>
&gt; &gt; of ...stuff... what do you do with it?  Here's the reason I'm<br/>
&gt; &gt; asking.  In my experience, geocachers are not always familiar with<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing and how we play our game.  Owing to the relative<br/>
&gt; &gt; imprecision of GPS devices, geocachers often show up in an area and<br/>
&gt; &gt; begin hunting around for a likely spot to hide a geocache.  They are<br/>
&gt; &gt; not aided by letterboxing clues like "look under the pile of rocks<br/>
&gt; &gt; at the base of the big tree."  Because both letterboxers and<br/>
&gt; &gt; geocachers tend to place their boxes in cool areas, there is often a<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox and geocache near each other.  Often, geocachers will find<br/>
&gt; &gt; the letterbox by mistake and think it is the geocache they were<br/>
&gt; &gt; searching for.  The will then open the box and be immediately<br/>
&gt; &gt; disappointed at the lack of ...stuff...  They will fall into one of<br/>
&gt; &gt; two categories: 1) the kind that will look through the journal,<br/>
&gt; &gt; realize the stamp in the box may have something to do with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamps in the journal, think that this may not exactly be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; geocache, sign in pen or pencil and leave, or 2) the kind that will<br/>
&gt; &gt; think the stamp is the ...stuff... they were looking for, take the<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp and leave some other ...stuff...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It's the latter of these that concerns me.  On more than one<br/>
&gt; &gt; occasion, I have come to a letterbox with no stamp, but does contain<br/>
&gt; &gt; a plastic alligator or wooden nickle.  I then know that a category 2<br/>
&gt; &gt; geocacher has been there.  Because of this, I now write on the lid<br/>
&gt; &gt; of all my boxes "This is not a geocache."<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, when I see ...stuff... in a letterbox I get worried that<br/>
&gt; &gt; geocachers are thinking the letterbox is the geocache and it is only<br/>
&gt; &gt; a matter of time until the stamp disappears and is replaced by Mardi<br/>
&gt; &gt; Gras beads.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; Yes, I have found Atoka and would recognize the spot. It's true it<br/>
&gt; might be under snow by now, but I'll give it a shot this week, if I<br/>
&gt; can, and let you know what I find - or don't find.<br/>

&gt; I have wondered about Atoka up the road<br/>
&gt; &gt; from there though.  Someone said it was missing, but it was a pretty<br/>
&gt; good<br/>
&gt; &gt; spot.  I planned to check on it when I went back for training this<br/>
&gt; fall, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I ended up doing an adoption placement that week instead.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Have you found that one to recognize the area?  If you are around, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldn't mind an update, but I don't need people to go too far out<br/>
&gt; of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; way.  I actually think that one might be higher in snow.  It would<br/>
&gt; likely<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to wait till spring.<br/>
