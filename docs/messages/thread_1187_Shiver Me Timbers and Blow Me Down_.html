shirkin' me duties.  I nearly missed waiving the Jolly Roger at all my <br/>
RML mates!  <br/>
<br/>
The mutinous scallywag said I should walk the plank and sink low to <br/>
Davy Jones' Locker for such a traitorous act. Alas, but it is so. Even <br/>
me parrot has flown to the crow's nest. So before my Cap'n makes me <br/>
scrape the barnacles off his rudder ... I'll give ye the precious booty.<br/>
<br/>
Avast, me beauties - step smartly, hoist yer grog, grab yer hook, <br/>
adjust yer wooden leg and try to enjoy what little is left of the only <br/>
day when it's really truly okay to say "Aye Aye" when your boss asks <br/>
you to clean out the bung hole. <br/>

Arrrrrrrrhhhhhh! <br/>
