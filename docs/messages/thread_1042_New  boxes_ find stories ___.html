Thanks for the heads up.  We haven't been watching for new clues.  I<br/>
mostly notice them, if they come up on the announcement list.  Otherwise,<br/>
we can be very slow to notice a new box.  We'll make sure we look for the<br/>
box when we get into Denver sometime.<br/>
<br/>
Also, your idea about a great "find" story folder could be a lot of fun. <br/>
The Marble box certainly is building a nice history of interesting<br/>
encounters.<br/>
