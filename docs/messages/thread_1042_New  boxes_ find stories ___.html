Thanks for the heads up.  We haven't been watching for new clues.  I<br>
mostly notice them, if they come up on the announcement list.  Otherwise,<br>
we can be very slow to notice a new box.  We'll make sure we look for the<br>
box when we get into Denver sometime.<br>
<br>
Also, your idea about a great "find" story folder could be a lot of fun. <br>
The Marble box certainly is building a nice history of interesting<br>
encounters.<br>

ran into a mother bear and cub looking for our very first letterbox <br>
in 2002 at Roxborough!  And, our scariest moment was the DARK TUNNEL <br>
that JeLybean sent us thru in the Springs!  YIKES!  And, what about <br>
that SQUIRREL nearly running up Cappy's arm looking for Fodor <br>
Glava!!!  Now, that is scary, especially when you think he may turn <br>
into a vampire!  YOW!  <br>
