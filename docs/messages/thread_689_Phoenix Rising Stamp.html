You don't NEED to send Phoenix Rising to me.  I'm hoping that sometime <br>
this fall I make it over to Moab.  Perhaps I'll round up the troops, <br>
Ravenwolf and clan, you and the fam, and daring I say perhaps Amy and <br>
Greg to make a party of it.  <br>

Cheers!!<br>

forever! I had planned on hiding it on this other wonderful trail, <br>
but the river is flooding the trailhead right now, and from the <br>
looks of things, it may not go down for a looooong time. They are <br>
talking about the Colorado flooding it's banks here for the first <br>
time in 23 years, and our daily river trips down the Westwater <br>
section are getting downright scary! Our company has had two <br>
evacuations off the river just this week! <br>
<br>
Thanks for the offer of Fiery Furnace pictures, but I think I see it <br>
too much as it is! (just got home from there an hour ago, 96 degrees <br>
today!)<br>
<br>
Puppypaws, I think a key to being outdoors in the really intense <br>
heat of summer, is to start early when it is relatively cool and <br>
warm up with the heat, then you don't notice it as bad. Once you <br>
step into an airconditioned car, house, or building, it's all over, <br>
and you'll need many pie flavored snow cones to cool you off! And <br>
yes, the neck coolers seem to work a bit!<br>
<br>
Yes, Es, we have banana creme, green apple, chololate creme, and all <br>
sorts of pie flavored snowies here, today I opted for banana-<br>
strawberry since it's 96 degrees today and supposed to be hotter <br>
tomorrow!!! I don't know how Y's green apple tasted, but it sure was <br>
a pretty color! <g><br>
