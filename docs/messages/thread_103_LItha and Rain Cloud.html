of you noted that it was getting rather full)<br/>
I'm going to replace it this week (I hope) and while I'm up there - <br/>
I'm going to check on the Litha box to see what's up.  It's been <br/>
reported lost, found, lost, found, and lost.<br/>
<br/>
I think I either hid it REALLY well - or its in a precarious place.  <br/>
If so, I may move it and re-work the clues.  Thanks to all of you for <br/>
helping me to keep track of this pesky box!<br/>
