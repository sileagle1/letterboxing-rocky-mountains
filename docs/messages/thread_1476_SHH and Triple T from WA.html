These two letterboxers and their kids are doing a tour they call The<br>
Biggest Field Trip Ever and they want to meet letterboxers along the<br>
way.  They will be SLC May 9 and we already have plans underway for an<br>
exchange.  The rest of their stops that involves our Rocky Mt states<br>
are:<br>
<br>
May 8 - Nampa ID<br>
<br>
May 10 - Moab UT<br>
<br>
May 11 - Albuquerque NM<br>
<br>
May 12 - Carlsbad NM<br>
<br>
May 31 - Buffalo WY<br>
<br>
June 1-2 - Yellowstone<br>
<br>
June 3 - Kellogg ID<br>
<br>
This is a whirlwind trip and they are going all the way to the SE USA,<br>
back up through the Midwest and Dakotas before coming back down into WY<br>
and ID.  They don't spend too long in any place (but a whole day in<br>
Moab!), so are looking more for exchanges that a lot of 'boxing.  If<br>
anyone is interested in exchanging with So Hill Hendersons and Triple T,<br>
let me know and I'll put you in touch with Triple T, who is the<br>
navigator.<br>
