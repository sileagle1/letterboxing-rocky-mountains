I'm so psyched that you guys will be there! And a *maybe* from Ramdelt <br>
too! As far as I know all the people who can attend can make either <br>
day, so we will narrow it down when someone chimes in that can only do <br>
one day. I can post the event on Atlasquest when we settle on a name <br>
and a date, that way we can check on the RSVP list as the time <br>
approaches.<br>

Sunday would work better for my group, as we have a commitment to the <br>
Great Dane rescue that we work with on Saturday. But it's only our <br>
lowly little group, so if saturday works better for most people, we <br>
will bow down to the greater cause.<br>

The idea that is being tossed around is a meeting at the park outside <br>
the faire at noon. This would give people a chance to go to the faire <br>
if they want in the morning, when it's less crowded and not too hot. <br>
And then stamping journals and eating pie and eclaires in the afternoon.<br>
<br>
So, we need more chiming. Shall we hold the gathering later? Earlier? <br>
Within the castle? Any other ideas?<br>

gooey sugar type foods.  That's why we wear all that lace... to <br>
