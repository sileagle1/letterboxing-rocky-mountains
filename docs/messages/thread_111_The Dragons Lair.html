It was planted in early August, and I know that at least one person found it<br/>
alive and well not long ago - Dixie in mid-Septermber.<br/>
This is a shame because it was really one of my best stamps.<br/>
Unfortunately, this is one of those boxes I will not be able to check on<br/>
often.<br/>

I'm forwarding your message to the Rocky Mountain Letterboxing group (please<br/>
feel free to join our message board, by the way) to see if anyone else has<br/>
had any luck with this one.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the news -<br/>

&gt; After following all your clues and coming to the exact spot where all the<br/>
clues lead to, the letterbox was missing.  We saw all the rocks that had<br/>
been uncovered around it but no letterbox.  I think someone has stolen it<br/>
after they saw it. I would appericate it if would e-mail me back.  Thanks a<br/>
lot.<br/>
