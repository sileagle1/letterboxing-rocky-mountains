<br/>
Let me explain.<br/>
<br/>
My neighbor's son (he is 2) has a very rare disease that has left him<br/>
completely disabled.  Horse therapy (I can't remember the correct name)<br/>
is a wonderful thing for disabled kids.  Thomas was able to go for 5<br/>
sessions this summer.  However, their insurance company changed their<br/>
mind about covering this therapy and they were left with a $500 bill.<br/>
Thomas LOVED this therapy, and they saw a wonderful change in his motor<br/>
skills.  But, having 4 children (10 yr old twins, a 5 year old and<br/>
Thomas who is 2) and only one income, they can't afford to continue<br/>
sending Thomas.<br/>
<br/>
My thought would be to put a box at the center and ask for a mandatory<br/>
donation of at least $5.00 in order to stamp in.  ALL of the money would<br/>
go towards the $100 sessions for Thomas.<br/>
<br/>
Would you visit the box even if it meant making the donation?<br/>
<br/>

What a nice thing for you to do.<br/>
<br/>
I'd go for sure.  I'm not sure if I'd want to leave cash at the time <br/>
or a check or whatever.. I guess it would depend on how the whole <br/>
thing was set up.  I'd just want to be sure the money made it to <br/>
that fund.  I'm guessing it would be at the desk or someplace and <br/>
you'd have to ask for it and make your donation?  I'd do that.<br/>

I am planning to leave the box in the Pegasus Office.  You would have to<br/>
ask the office staff for the box.  You would give them your money before<br/>
you got the box.  The money will go in an envelope that I will go by and<br/>
collect 2-3 times a month.  My daughter volunteers there, so we are<br/>
there at least that often.  I don't want to burden the staff (it is very<br/>
small) with having to set up an account for Thomas (I am not even sure<br/>
they can do that).  So, each time I have enough funds for 1 therapy<br/>
visit ($100), I would ask for a gift certificate that I will present to<br/>
Thomas' family.<br/>
<br/>
Also - as each log book is full, I will be giving that to them as well -<br/>
like a card =]<br/>
<br/>
PS - I will also make a HUGE note in the clues stating that a donation<br/>
is required, so there are no surprises when you get to the box.<br/>
