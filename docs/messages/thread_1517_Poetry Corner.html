And I think we all can use each style when it suits us most. To <br/>

<br/>
The Limmerick of the Letterboxing Pirate:<br/>
<br/>
A pirate with cluesheet in hand<br/>
And a ship that sails over the land, <br/>
Over miles will tramp<br/>
For the tiniest stamp<br/>
And think that their plunder was grand.<br/>
<br/>
Or this little ditty:<br/>
<br/>
Es was a pirate who thought<br/>
Some mystery clues could be bought<br/>
She plundered a bakery<br/>
For pies and cheesecakery,<br/>
To use as a bribe, and y-nought?<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the Ninja Haiku:<br/>
<br/>
On a busy street<br/>
A woman ties her shoelace<br/>
and snags tupperware.<br/>
<br/>
Or:<br/>
<br/>
Invisible man<br/>
Leaves one sign of his passage<br/>
A Pink Jellybean!<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure you folks can do better than these....and I would sure like <br/>
to hear some more!<br/>

&gt; The Limmerick of the Letterboxing Pirate:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A pirate with cluesheet in hand<br/>
&gt; And a ship that sails over the land, <br/>
&gt; Over miles will tramp<br/>
&gt; For the tiniest stamp<br/>
&gt; And think that their plunder was grand.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or this little ditty:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Es was a pirate who thought<br/>
&gt; Some mystery clues could be bought<br/>
&gt; She plundered a bakery<br/>
&gt; For pies and cheesecakery,<br/>
&gt; To use as a bribe, and y-nought?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the other hand, the Ninja Haiku:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a busy street<br/>
&gt; A woman ties her shoelace<br/>
&gt; and snags tupperware.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Invisible man<br/>
&gt; Leaves one sign of his passage<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Limmerick of the Letterboxing Pirate:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A pirate with cluesheet in hand<br/>
&gt; And a ship that sails over the land, <br/>
&gt; Over miles will tramp<br/>
&gt; For the tiniest stamp<br/>
&gt; And think that their plunder was grand.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or this little ditty:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Es was a pirate who thought<br/>
&gt; Some mystery clues could be bought<br/>
&gt; She plundered a bakery<br/>
&gt; For pies and cheesecakery,<br/>
&gt; To use as a bribe, and y-nought?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the other hand, the Ninja Haiku:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a busy street<br/>
&gt; A woman ties her shoelace<br/>
&gt; and snags tupperware.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Invisible man<br/>
&gt; Leaves one sign of his passage<br/>
&gt; A Pink Jellybean!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm sure you folks can do better than these....and I would sure <br/>
like <br/>
&gt; to hear some more!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; y-nought<br/>
