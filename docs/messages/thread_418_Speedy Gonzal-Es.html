Boy, Es, are you fast!  Of course, as you must know, I have a PhD in <br>
Latin and so I was thinking last night how I would go out this <br>
morning and get some produce while it was still fresh, only to find <br>
the hour drive from the Springs has conspired against me!  Arrrrgh! <br>
(Exclaimed in proper pirate accent...)  But then, my anguish turns <br>
to a big grin and I am glad you are the slightly quicker of us two.<br>
