So I just spent the last 6 hours sitting at the airport watching <br/>
ginormous planes landing as they're diverted from .... everywhere.... <br/>
because Denver is having the worst snow of the season!<br/>
<br/>
They finally cancelled our day and sent us home with instructions to <br/>
stay close to a phone.  I'm looking longingly towards Moab and hoping <br/>
y'all aren't gettin' this wind that's screaming around the mountains in <br/>
Grand Junction.  The weather thing on the news looks like Moab is <br/>
pretty clear! Wooohoo!! <br/>
<br/>
The good news is...as the two crews were sitting and chatting I <br/>
mentioned to the other flight attendant about your gathering and now <br/>
she's ready to get out there and box!!  So.. add another comfy chair to <br/>
the circle, she'll be here soon!<br/>
