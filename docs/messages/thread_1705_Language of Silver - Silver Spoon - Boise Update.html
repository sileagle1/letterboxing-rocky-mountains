If anyone happens to head out again here is a note from Capperpillar<br>
from yesterday - Silver Spoon -- it's still there! While we were out<br>
there today, we decided to check on it and we found it. Only one other<br>
person has found it since we did last June. There's a small trail that<br>
runs along the fence, and the box is at the base of the 5th or 6th post<br>
(depending on how you count them), which is about 20 steps down that<br>
small trail. There were several posts with rocks piled at their base, so<br>
it could seem like it was missing if you look by the wrong post.<br>
