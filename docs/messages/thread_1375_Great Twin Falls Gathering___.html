                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great gathering at Twin Falls!  A huge thank you to DragonRider for <br/>
all his preparations, planning and watching over us as we braved the <br/>
heat at the Falls to look for all the great boxes that had been <br/>
planted.  I have never drank so much lemonade in my life but I was so <br/>
thankful that the jug was full and that it was ice cold!  My hats off <br/>
for spoiling us rotten while we were in town.  <br/>
<br/>
It was wonderful to see DragonRider, BoxerLover and Trouble Bug again <br/>
this year.  Always good times when you can box with familiar faces.  <br/>
And we so enjoyed meeting and boxing with Singing Wolf, Howling <br/>
Coyote, Ronnie Penguin and A Bug.  We really appreciated everyone <br/>
making the effort to come to Idaho for our second gathering this <br/>
year.  Now if we can just tempt everyone to Boise again some time.  <br/>
So many boxes, never enough time.  <br/>
<br/>
It was also a lot of fun for Lizman and I to travel with our favorite <br/>
letterboxing buddy A-Bear on the way to Twin Falls.  She is a true <br/>
partner in crime boxing from sun up to sun down in all kinds of <br/>
weather over the years.  Gotta love those that share the addiction <br/>
and understand your need to find "just one more" before calling it a <br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
I will post some pictures on the event album but will also add them <br/>
to an album in Kodak Gallery in the next couple of days.  We shot <br/>
lots of them and there are too many to add to the actual event <br/>
album.  Attendees can send me a direct e-mail with their e-mail <br/>
address and I will send over the Kodak Gallery link once I have them <br/>
up on the site.  <br/>
<br/>
Safe travels to everyone as they head home and we hope to see <br/>
everyone out on the trail again soon!  Happy Hunting!<br/>
