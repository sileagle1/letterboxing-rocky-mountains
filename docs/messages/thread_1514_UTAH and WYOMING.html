&gt;Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Best Friends is a very cool place to spend some time. It is my daughter's favorite place in <br/>
the world! There is a box on the premises of Best Friends, also there is one right outside <br/>
Zion NP in the little town of Springdale. There are several great ones in St. George, but <br/>
also a couple of less than good as well. I'll have to go through my journal tomorrow and <br/>
let you know which ones I have. Cedar City has a few nice boxes, and there is a great one <br/>
in Parowan, just north of Cedar City. There are a couple of other boxes in the Zion-Kanab <br/>
area near hwy. 89 that I haven't had time to hike to yet, and there is a good box at the <br/>
Zion entrance to Kolob Canyon off I-15 south of Cedar City. There is one listed in <br/>
Hurricane, but we couldn't find it as the area had a new subdivision built there, and it was <br/>
at the end of a busy day when we hunted for it. Anyway, it's a beautiful fun area with or <br/>
without boxes!<br/>
