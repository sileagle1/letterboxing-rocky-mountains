<br>
I had the greatest weekend in Moab hunting down the new (and a few <br>
older) letterboxes in that area. It looks like I missed running into <br>
Dixie Peach and Cappy again by a day.<br>
<br>
I want to say thanks to Blackvelvetrav, Lizman, A-Bear, CW Sunseeker, <br>
Aljan Sundance, Kennamtn and Kat for placing all those great <br>
letterboxes. And a huge thanks to Kat, Aspen and Kennamtn for the warm <br>
welcome and fun company on a few of the hikes.<br>
<br>
It was so cool to find each letterbox and remember meeting the placer <br>
just over a month ago.<br>
<br>
Is this a fun hobby, or what?<br>

Alien Gothic on our way back home.  What a great place and fantastic <br>
stamp...well worth the hike!  At least this one didn't make us cry <br>

<br>
While we were in Moab we hiked the Fiery Furnace in Arches.  WOW!  <br>
What a cool place!  We kept spotting many perfect places for <br>
letterboxes....too bad they don't let you hide them in Arches!  The <br>
flowers were in bloom and made such a beautiful setting!  There were <br>
many boxes we still had to leave behind and will go back for.  We'll <br>

Fall.  <br>

I noticed your friend's stamps in all the logbooks that I visited. <br>
Looks like we have some new recruits.<br>
<br>
I also remember from your stamp and the picture you posted that you and <br>
Cappy made it to Morning Glory Bridge. Is that place awesome, or what? <br>
I had hiked that trail a couple of years before but I had forgotten <br>
just how beautiful it is. And it was double fun to hike it with Kat and <br>
Kennamtn!<br>
<br>
But tell me, did you by any chance find Rock Dweller out at Dead Horse <br>
Point?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Ed!<br>
<br>
Morning Glory Bridge is totally awesome, and we saw it in the <br>
morning!  I have a few more pics I can email you if you like, I <br>
didn't want to upload too many to this site.  <br>
<br>
Kat, I have many from Moab that you may like too, do you want me to <br>
email them to you?  I have a few great ones from the Fiery Furnace!  <br>
Plus, I got some wild flower pics.  They were so awesome last <br>
weekend, all in bloom!  We loved them! What a beautiful place to <br>
live!<br>
<br>
Ed, we did find Rock Crawler but I have to tell you that we knew <br>
where it was without the directions because we ran into A-Bear and <br>
crew while they were placing it!  It was too funny!  We wondered if <br>
there is a special designation for finding a box WHILE it's being <br>
planted!  We did have our friends stamp in and it's still there, but <br>
we led them to it. Did you get the other two at Dead Horse Point?  <br>
We walked along the opposite trail a way and I got a fantastic <br>
picture of a tree growing out of the rock ledge.  We also stopped at <br>
one on the way out of the park at a rest stop and we couldn't <br>
believe how many people walked over to where we were trying to <br>
discreetly stamp and see what we were up to.  I mean, we're in the <br>
middle of next to nowhere and people went out of there way to walk <br>
nearly on top of us!  GADS!  But, we were careful and waited them <br>
out!  Too funny!  People have to see if they're missing something!<br>
<br>
Now Ed, when are you coming to this side of the mountains to box?  <br>
Oh yes, is there still plans for get together at the Ren Fest?<br>
<br>
Hugs, Dixie Peach    <br>
