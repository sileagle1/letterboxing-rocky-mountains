I see what you mean, "Southwest Colorado" doesn't really point to <br/>
Grand Junction.<br/>
<br/>
The way the map is split up Grand Junction and Durango are in the <br/>
same area. And we in Durango consider ourselves part of the Western <br/>
Slope. <br/>
<br/>
"High Country" originally included the area around Aspen and Vail, <br/>
and northwest to Steamboat.<br/>
<br/>
This all makes sense to us from Colorado and I could just ask Choi to <br/>
change it back. I think one issue is that visitors might be confused. <br/>
Since we have a lot of "High Country" down here in the southwest and <br/>
Meeker and Granby are part of the Western Slope.<br/>
<br/>
Should we devise a poll?<br/>

Colorado!! In Utah, we just have Utah, no areas, even though Moab <br/>
has a TON of boxes now! Moab needs it's own designation! Since I <br/>
look at everything in Utah, I'm just used to looking for counties, <br/>
so when I look at the Colorado map, I do the same thing. If I don't <br/>
see a county, I just look in another section of Colorado, especially <br/>
since when I click on a part of the map, usually the wrong area pops <br/>
up anyway!! I'm just happy when I can head your way, regardless of <br/>
how it's set up!! <g><br/>

I asked Choi to work on the LBNA Colorado Map and he jumped right on <br/>
it. The letterboxes in Montezuma County are now listed with their <br/>
neighboring boxes. And the area on the map leads to the correct clues.<br/>
<br/>
However:<br/>
<br/>
The Northwest area is now called "Western Slope", and the Southwest <br/>
Area is called "High Country" which is backwards of what it used to be.<br/>
<br/>
What do you folks think of just asking him to call them "Northwest <br/>
Colorado" and "Southwest Colorado".<br/>
<br/>
I think this might be easier, but I feel we need some feedback from you <br/>
people who use the map.<br/>

I see what you mean, "Southwest Colorado" doesn't really point to <br/>
Grand Junction.<br/>
<br/>
The way the map is split up Grand Junction and Durango are in the <br/>
same area. And we in Durango consider ourselves part of the Western <br/>
Slope. <br/>
<br/>
"High Country" originally included the area around Aspen and Vail, <br/>
and northwest to Steamboat.<br/>
<br/>
This all makes sense to us from Colorado and I could just ask Choi to <br/>
change it back. I think one issue is that visitors might be confused. <br/>
Since we have a lot of "High Country" down here in the southwest and <br/>
Meeker and Granby are part of the Western Slope.<br/>
<br/>
Should we devise a poll?<br/>

I now have looked at the letterboxing.org map and I see how this works. <br/>
I usually just search by state and work through the list.  High Country<br/>
is definitely an odd category as it does run from Wyoming on down to the<br/>
southern border of our state!  What about Northwest, Southwest, Front<br/>
Range and Eastern Plains?  I personally think that the northwest and<br/>
southwest could all be fused into one category ... West or Western Slope.<br/>
 Is everything on the other side of the divide considered Western Slope? <br/>
That would give us three categories cutting the state into vertical<br/>
strips.<br/>

You're right, geologically the Western Slope means everything west of <br/>
the Continental Divide. Politically speaking, I think that the San Luis <br/>
Valley considers itself more a part of the Western Slope than the <br/>
Eastern Plains.<br/>
<br/>
If we lumped the north and south groups together they total 64 boxes <br/>
now. And even if that doubles in the next few years I don't see that as <br/>
much of a problem. It still comes down to Choi and how much work it is <br/>
to re-do the map. Maybe we should ask him what he thinks, too.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When the LbNA map for Colorado was first sectioned out - I worked <br/>
with the guy at the time who was managing it.  We only had a whopping <br/>
20 or so boxes in the entire state, so divisions of more detail just <br/>
seemed to make things more complicated.  *laughs*<br/>
<br/>
Since letterboxing has grown so much in Colorado (YAY!) I think it <br/>
totally makes sense to re-divide the map into something that makes a <br/>
bit more sense.  What each section is CALLED is rather irrelevant, <br/>
(to me) since people looking at the map will have a general idea <br/>
where they're headed. <br/>
<br/>
If you LIVE in Colorado - the terms "Front Range, High Country, and <br/>
Western Slope" make total sense.  However, if you're travelling into <br/>
the state, it might not make sense at all.  <br/>
<br/>
My suggestion would be to go with the division that was mentioned <br/>
below.  Western Slope, SW Colorado, High Country, Front Range, and <br/>
Eastern Plains.  <br/>
<br/>
Those from within the state will understand the areas, and those <br/>
coming to visit us will be looking at a map anyway.  But this type of <br/>
division is much clearer and will make planning boxing trips ever so <br/>
much easier.  <br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.  <br/>
