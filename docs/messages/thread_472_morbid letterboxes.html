Humphreys Store.  Is it still there?  I spent a summer working as an<br/>
intern there oh.. maybe a hundred years ago. Ok maybe 20.. but it feels<br/>
like more.  If I could plant a box upstairs in the second bedroom on the<br/>
left... well maybe I will save it for another time.<br/>

I guess I need to take a trip up in that area again.  Please do plant some<br/>
boxes so that I have an excuse to go this summer.<br/>

&gt;&gt; five LBs right here in town plus more that I already have in<br/>
&gt;&gt; outlying<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sadly, the Lemony Letterbox is definitely gone.  It appears as<br/>
&gt; though there was some grooming done on the trail in October or<br/>
&gt; November (don't know when the box was last found, check your books)<br/>
&gt; and the tree that was well surrounded by dense weeds was given a<br/>
&gt; crewcut.  I am going to call South Suburban Parks and Recreation to<br/>
&gt; see if it was turned in to lost &amp; found by their maintenence crew,<br/>
&gt; but I am not holding my breath.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dilbox is still safe, though it was peeking from its hiding place<br/>
&gt; and could have been easily spotted by a non-boxer.  I hid it better<br/>
&gt; and hopefully anyone else who finds it will hide it even better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Found with Bite My Shiny Letter Box that the trail and tree had also<br/>
&gt; been groomed recently, but luckily someone had moved the box a bit<br/>
&gt; further from the trail and tree but in the same general area (and<br/>
&gt; put it in a Ziploc as well, for some reason).  We checked out<br/>
&gt; JodieMKern's husband's stamp and it is really cool!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So the lesson learned:  don't hide your letterboxes too close to a<br/>
&gt; South Suburban trail.<br/>

&gt; New Year's Eve letterboxing and we want to report to the Splendid<br/>
&gt; Buccaneers that both of these two letterboxes are doing fine!  What<br/>

&gt; go!  The stamps are absolutely SPLENDID! And the home made log books<br/>
&gt; you must see to appreciate!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jodi, I too have a a new grandbaby, well, 10 months old now!  He's a<br/>
&gt; sweetie!  We wanted to plant our first box but have never carved<br/>
&gt; before and now with all the wonderful stamps we're finding, we're a<br/>
&gt; bit intimidated!  We have some ideas but can't seem to get the them<br/>
&gt; to transfer easily to the rubber....can anyone help me???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Happy NEW year to all!  Have a fruitful letterbox year in 2005!<br/>

&gt; think there are many that could be offended regardless of your tact.<br/>
&gt; If you felt strongly about doing something.  I think you could have<br/>
&gt; some kind of very nice tribute somewhere a little more removed than at<br/>
&gt; Columbine--oh, and I probably wouldn't discuss it on the big list.  I<br/>
&gt; can see someone turning it into an ugly flame.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is much more removed than our immediate history, but I found one<br/>
&gt; letterbox that was at a very important yet unknown part of US and<br/>
&gt; Native American history.  It is part of our country's forgotten<br/>
&gt; history, and it is a shame that others haven't known about it.  I<br/>
&gt; don't think I can say more without giving clues away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can think of many that would feel this was a desecration of a sacred<br/>
&gt; place for many cultures.  The planter put her heart and soul into it<br/>
&gt; though and her nicest carving to that date.  She hid it in a larger<br/>
&gt; box and included an in-depth reading of the history of that place and<br/>
&gt; its culture and why it was important for all of us to understand it<br/>
&gt; better and honor the people who had gone before.  The box clue was<br/>
&gt; hidden with a name that was different than what one might expect, so<br/>
&gt; it wasn't flaunting "Oh, here, I put a box at a sacred place. Isn't it<br/>
&gt; cool!" I haven't seen her push the box.  She has been very unassuming<br/>
&gt; about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I learned so much from doing this letterbox and was grateful for it.<br/>
&gt; I'm not going to tell you which it is though and ruin it.  Sorry!  And<br/>
&gt; I have letterboxed all over the western US and through many other<br/>
&gt; places, so it could be anywhere.  I think she struck a nice balance<br/>
&gt; that not many could have done.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, this has been a nice diversion from work for a few.  Now back to<br/>
&gt; the grindstone!  Hope you don't mind my two cents (actually, I'm not<br/>
&gt; good at two cent writing.  I do more like a quarter :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Que les valle bien y pasen un buen ano nuevo!  (Dang, I need<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Woohoo! What a fun note..thanks so much!  Did you by any chance spot<br/>
&gt; a compass lying near the Little Raven box?  CWSunseeker dropped<br/>
&gt; her's there when she was stamping in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here's how I transfer for stamp carving.. I know it's not the best<br/>
&gt; way but it works for me.<br/>
&gt; I haven't been able to find one of the old type of copy machines, so<br/>
&gt; had to go with plan b.  Or c or d depending on who you talk to.<br/>
&gt; I print out my design from the computer or draw it by hand. When<br/>
&gt; it's the way I want it I go over the lines with a pencil.  I flip it<br/>
&gt; onto the carving material, rub all over it back and forth and up and<br/>
&gt; down and swirly and jiggy with a blender pen that I got at an art<br/>
&gt; store.  It's a clear fluid that's for transferring and blending..I<br/>
&gt; just went into the art store and described it and they knew exactly<br/>
&gt; what it was.  While it's still kind of damp I rub the back with a<br/>
&gt; folder thingie...the bone letter opener looking thing that you use<br/>
&gt; to fold paper for books, etc. (got it at a craft store).  You can<br/>
&gt; use anything for that I suspect.  I used to do it without the<br/>
&gt; blender stuff, and it will transfer.  But with the blender pen you<br/>
&gt; get every smidge of pencil to transfer to the rubber (and some of<br/>
&gt; the ink from the computer).  At this point I know you could go ahead<br/>
&gt; and carve, but I usually go over it all again on the rubber with a<br/>
&gt; very fine point black marker.  It doesn't smudge when you're carving<br/>
&gt; and gives me sharper lines to carve along.  It sounds like a lot of<br/>
&gt; work but it's not really.  You'll have fun! Especially if there's<br/>
&gt; pie.<br/>
&gt; I bet some of these other folks have some great systems.  Anyone?!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Es, who will be waiting to find your first box!<br/>

&gt; I think everyone does it differently...  I draw my design out with pencil<br/>
&gt; and then just flip it over onto my carving medium (drawing side down then)<br/>
&gt; and then rub, draw...  how do I say it...  blacken the whole drawing area<br/>
&gt; on the backside and when I lift it up the design has transfered.<br/>

&gt; ES, we did in fact find the compass inside the letterbox.  We<br/>
&gt; thought it was odd that it was in there, but thought you left it in<br/>
&gt; there for fun!  It's still there if CWSunseeker wants to go back for<br/>
&gt; it.  Now is a good time, NO SNOW on the ground that would show<br/>
&gt; tracks!  In fact, today was so gorgeous!  The log book "holder" (I<br/>
&gt; don't want to give it away) is so special....what thought you put<br/>
&gt; into your boxes!!! THANKS AGAIN, ES!  WE LOVE YOUR BOXES!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks to you and Jodi for the stamp tips!  We will try it out and<br/>
&gt; try to get some "P"'s in our name! Happy New Year to you, as the<br/>
&gt; clock runs down towards midnight!  (BTW, what time zone is this<br/>
&gt; group recording in...it already shows it's 2005!).<br/>

&gt;     I'm not weirded out by the idea of that many letterboxes in your<br/>
&gt; town. But I'm a little freaked by how easy it is for you to find<br/>
&gt; morbid history there. I can't wait 'till you place them so I can see<br/>

&gt; All kinds of weird things have happened in these little mountain towns!  I<br/>

&gt;     I'm not weirded out by the idea of that many letterboxes in your<br/>
&gt; town. But I'm a little freaked by how easy it is for you to find<br/>
&gt; morbid history there. I can't wait 'till you place them so I can see<br/>
&gt; what spooky stuff has been happening. Plus, I'm all about the ice<br/>
&gt; cream.<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; Woohoo! What a fun note..thanks so much!  Did you by any chance<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; a compass lying near the Little Raven box?  CWSunseeker dropped<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; her's there when she was stamping in.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Here's how I transfer for stamp carving.. I know it's not the best<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; way but it works for me.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I haven't been able to find one of the old type of copy machines,<br/>
&gt;&gt; so<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; had to go with plan b.  Or c or d depending on who you talk to.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I print out my design from the computer or draw it by hand. When<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; it's the way I want it I go over the lines with a pencil.  I flip<br/>
&gt;&gt; it<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; onto the carving material, rub all over it back and forth and up<br/>
&gt;&gt; and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; down and swirly and jiggy with a blender pen that I got at an art<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; store.  It's a clear fluid that's for transferring and blending..I<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; just went into the art store and described it and they knew<br/>
&gt;&gt; exactly<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; what it was.  While it's still kind of damp I rub the back with a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; folder thingie...the bone letter opener looking thing that you use<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; to fold paper for books, etc. (got it at a craft store).  You can<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; use anything for that I suspect.  I used to do it without the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; blender stuff, and it will transfer.  But with the blender pen you<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; get every smidge of pencil to transfer to the rubber (and some of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the ink from the computer).  At this point I know you could go<br/>
&gt;&gt; ahead<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and carve, but I usually go over it all again on the rubber with a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; very fine point black marker.  It doesn't smudge when you're<br/>
&gt;&gt; carving<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and gives me sharper lines to carve along.  It sounds like a lot<br/>
&gt;&gt; of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; work but it's not really.  You'll have fun! Especially if there's<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; pie.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I bet some of these other folks have some great systems.  Anyone?!<br/>

&gt; She had mentioned dropping it to me right after she found the box<br/>
&gt; and someone else said they saw it but left it because they didn't<br/>
&gt; know who it belonged to and thought they might be coming back for<br/>
&gt; it.  She had already gone on home, so when I told her it had been<br/>
&gt; seen she said not to worry about it.  But I'd really like to scoop<br/>
&gt; it up and send it to her.  I was going to post a note on the Little<br/>
&gt; Raven clues but didn't get a chance to do so in time.<br/>
&gt; I'll be coming that way sometime here soon and will swing by and get<br/>
&gt; it.. it sounds like it's in the box so it will surely be safe!<br/>
&gt; If someone goes up before then and wants to grab it for her, that'd<br/>
&gt; be wonderful, too!<br/>

&gt; I actually have little raven on my list and am hoping to hit it really<br/>
&gt; soon...  like this weekend soon...  if it's still there when I drop by I<br/>
&gt; will pick it up if someone can tell me where to mail it.<br/>

&gt; She had mentioned dropping it to me right after she found the box<br/>

&gt; know who it belonged to and thought they might be coming back for<br/>
&gt; it.  She had already gone on home, so when I told her it had been<br/>
&gt; seen she said not to worry about it.  But I'd really like to scoop<br/>
&gt; it up and send it to her.  I was going to post a note on the Little<br/>
&gt; Raven clues but didn't get a chance to do so in time.<br/>
&gt; I'll be coming that way sometime here soon and will swing by and get<br/>
&gt; it.. it sounds like it's in the box so it will surely be safe!<br/>
&gt; If someone goes up before then and wants to grab it for her, that'd<br/>
&gt; be wonderful, too!<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; ES, we did in fact find the compass inside the letterbox.  We<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; thought it was odd that it was in there, but thought you left it<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; there for fun!  It's still there if CWSunseeker wants to go back<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; it.  Now is a good time, NO SNOW on the ground that would show<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; tracks!  In fact, today was so gorgeous!  The log book "holder"<br/>
&gt; (I<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; don't want to give it away) is so special....what thought you put<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks to you and Jodi for the stamp tips!  We will try it out<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Woohoo! What a fun note..thanks so much!  Did you by any chance<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; spot<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a compass lying near the Little Raven box?  CWSunseeker dropped<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; her's there when she was stamping in.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Here's how I transfer for stamp carving.. I know it's not the<br/>
&gt; best<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; way but it works for me.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't been able to find one of the old type of copy<br/>
&gt; machines,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; so<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; had to go with plan b.  Or c or d depending on who you talk to.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I print out my design from the computer or draw it by hand.<br/>
&gt; When<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it's the way I want it I go over the lines with a pencil.  I<br/>
&gt; flip<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; it<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; onto the carving material, rub all over it back and forth and<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; down and swirly and jiggy with a blender pen that I got at an<br/>
&gt; art<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; store.  It's a clear fluid that's for transferring and<br/>
&gt; blending..I<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; just went into the art store and described it and they knew<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; exactly<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; what it was.  While it's still kind of damp I rub the back<br/>
&gt; with a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; folder thingie...the bone letter opener looking thing that you<br/>
&gt; use<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to fold paper for books, etc. (got it at a craft store).  You<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; use anything for that I suspect.  I used to do it without the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; blender stuff, and it will transfer.  But with the blender pen<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; get every smidge of pencil to transfer to the rubber (and some<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the ink from the computer).  At this point I know you could go<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; ahead<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and carve, but I usually go over it all again on the rubber<br/>
&gt; with a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; very fine point black marker.  It doesn't smudge when you're<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; carving<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and gives me sharper lines to carve along.  It sounds like a<br/>
&gt; lot<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; work but it's not really.  You'll have fun! Especially if<br/>
&gt; there's<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; pie.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I bet some of these other folks have some great systems.<br/>
&gt; Anyone?!<br/>

&gt; Sadly, the Lemony Letterbox is definitely gone.  It appears as<br/>
&gt; though there was some grooming done on the trail in October or<br/>
&gt; November (don't know when the box was last found, check your books)<br/>
&gt; and the tree that was well surrounded by dense weeds was given a<br/>
&gt; crewcut.  I am going to call South Suburban Parks and Recreation to<br/>
&gt; see if it was turned in to lost &amp; found by their maintenence crew,<br/>
&gt; but I am not holding my breath.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dilbox is still safe, though it was peeking from its hiding place<br/>
&gt; and could have been easily spotted by a non-boxer.  I hid it better<br/>
&gt; and hopefully anyone else who finds it will hide it even better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Found with Bite My Shiny Letter Box that the trail and tree had also<br/>
&gt; been groomed recently, but luckily someone had moved the box a bit<br/>
&gt; further from the trail and tree but in the same general area (and<br/>
&gt; put it in a Ziploc as well, for some reason).  We checked out<br/>
&gt; JodieMKern's husband's stamp and it is really cool!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;&gt; You know, I thought about putting a box near Columbine HS and even<br/>
&gt; went over<br/>
&gt;&gt; there to look around.  Then, thought better of it.  Too much pain too<br/>
&gt; soon.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'm going to agree agree that you probably shouldn't do it yet, but I<br/>
&gt; think some could do it tastefully, if very, very, very careful.  But I<br/>
&gt; think there are many that could be offended regardless of your tact.<br/>
&gt; If you felt strongly about doing something.  I think you could have<br/>
&gt; some kind of very nice tribute somewhere a little more removed than at<br/>
&gt; Columbine--oh, and I probably wouldn't discuss it on the big list.  I<br/>
&gt; can see someone turning it into an ugly flame.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is much more removed than our immediate history, but I found one<br/>
&gt; letterbox that was at a very important yet unknown part of US and<br/>
&gt; Native American history.  It is part of our country's forgotten<br/>
&gt; history, and it is a shame that others haven't known about it.  I<br/>
&gt; don't think I can say more without giving clues away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can think of many that would feel this was a desecration of a sacred<br/>
&gt; place for many cultures.  The planter put her heart and soul into it<br/>
&gt; though and her nicest carving to that date.  She hid it in a larger<br/>
&gt; box and included an in-depth reading of the history of that place and<br/>
&gt; its culture and why it was important for all of us to understand it<br/>
&gt; better and honor the people who had gone before.  The box clue was<br/>
&gt; hidden with a name that was different than what one might expect, so<br/>
&gt; it wasn't flaunting "Oh, here, I put a box at a sacred place. Isn't it<br/>
&gt; cool!" I haven't seen her push the box.  She has been very unassuming<br/>
&gt; about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I learned so much from doing this letterbox and was grateful for it.<br/>
&gt; I'm not going to tell you which it is though and ruin it.  Sorry!  And<br/>
&gt; I have letterboxed all over the western US and through many other<br/>
&gt; places, so it could be anywhere.  I think she struck a nice balance<br/>
&gt; that not many could have done.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, this has been a nice diversion from work for a few.  Now back to<br/>
&gt; the grindstone!  Hope you don't mind my two cents (actually, I'm not<br/>
&gt; good at two cent writing.  I do more like a quarter :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Woohoo! What a fun note..thanks so much!  Did you by any chance spot<br/>
&gt; a compass lying near the Little Raven box?  CWSunseeker dropped<br/>
&gt; her's there when she was stamping in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here's how I transfer for stamp carving.. I know it's not the best<br/>
&gt; way but it works for me.<br/>
&gt; I haven't been able to find one of the old type of copy machines, so<br/>
&gt; had to go with plan b.  Or c or d depending on who you talk to.<br/>
&gt; I print out my design from the computer or draw it by hand. When<br/>
&gt; it's the way I want it I go over the lines with a pencil.  I flip it<br/>
&gt; onto the carving material, rub all over it back and forth and up and<br/>
&gt; down and swirly and jiggy with a blender pen that I got at an art<br/>
&gt; store.  It's a clear fluid that's for transferring and blending..I<br/>
&gt; just went into the art store and described it and they knew exactly<br/>
&gt; what it was.  While it's still kind of damp I rub the back with a<br/>
&gt; folder thingie...the bone letter opener looking thing that you use<br/>
&gt; to fold paper for books, etc. (got it at a craft store).  You can<br/>
&gt; use anything for that I suspect.  I used to do it without the<br/>
&gt; blender stuff, and it will transfer.  But with the blender pen you<br/>
&gt; get every smidge of pencil to transfer to the rubber (and some of<br/>
&gt; the ink from the computer).  At this point I know you could go ahead<br/>
&gt; and carve, but I usually go over it all again on the rubber with a<br/>
&gt; very fine point black marker.  It doesn't smudge when you're carving<br/>
&gt; and gives me sharper lines to carve along.  It sounds like a lot of<br/>
&gt; work but it's not really.  You'll have fun! Especially if there's<br/>
&gt; pie.<br/>
&gt; I bet some of these other folks have some great systems.  Anyone?!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Es, who will be waiting to find your first box!<br/>

&gt; I think everyone does it differently...  I draw my design out with pencil<br/>
&gt; and then just flip it over onto my carving medium (drawing side down then)<br/>
&gt; and then rub, draw...  how do I say it...  blacken the whole drawing area<br/>
&gt; on the backside and when I lift it up the design has transfered.<br/>

&gt; MUST<br/>

&gt;&gt; before and now with all the wonderful stamps we're finding, we're<br/>

&gt;&gt; Happy NEW year to all!  Have a fruitful letterbox year in 2005!<br/>

&gt; ES, we did in fact find the compass inside the letterbox.  We<br/>
&gt; thought it was odd that it was in there, but thought you left it in<br/>
&gt; there for fun!  It's still there if CWSunseeker wants to go back for<br/>
&gt; it.  Now is a good time, NO SNOW on the ground that would show<br/>
&gt; tracks!  In fact, today was so gorgeous!  The log book "holder" (I<br/>
&gt; don't want to give it away) is so special....what thought you put<br/>
&gt; into your boxes!!! THANKS AGAIN, ES!  WE LOVE YOUR BOXES!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks to you and Jodi for the stamp tips!  We will try it out and<br/>
&gt; try to get some "P"'s in our name! Happy New Year to you, as the<br/>
&gt; clock runs down towards midnight!  (BTW, what time zone is this<br/>
&gt; group recording in...it already shows it's 2005!).<br/>

&gt;&gt; Woohoo! What a fun note..thanks so much!  Did you by any chance<br/>
&gt; spot<br/>
&gt;&gt; a compass lying near the Little Raven box?  CWSunseeker dropped<br/>
&gt;&gt; her's there when she was stamping in.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Here's how I transfer for stamp carving.. I know it's not the best<br/>
&gt;&gt; way but it works for me.<br/>
&gt;&gt; I haven't been able to find one of the old type of copy machines,<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt;&gt; had to go with plan b.  Or c or d depending on who you talk to.<br/>
&gt;&gt; I print out my design from the computer or draw it by hand. When<br/>
&gt;&gt; it's the way I want it I go over the lines with a pencil.  I flip<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt;&gt; onto the carving material, rub all over it back and forth and up<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt;&gt; down and swirly and jiggy with a blender pen that I got at an art<br/>
&gt;&gt; store.  It's a clear fluid that's for transferring and blending..I<br/>
&gt;&gt; just went into the art store and described it and they knew<br/>
&gt; exactly<br/>
&gt;&gt; what it was.  While it's still kind of damp I rub the back with a<br/>
&gt;&gt; folder thingie...the bone letter opener looking thing that you use<br/>
&gt;&gt; to fold paper for books, etc. (got it at a craft store).  You can<br/>
&gt;&gt; use anything for that I suspect.  I used to do it without the<br/>
&gt;&gt; blender stuff, and it will transfer.  But with the blender pen you<br/>
&gt;&gt; get every smidge of pencil to transfer to the rubber (and some of<br/>
&gt;&gt; the ink from the computer).  At this point I know you could go<br/>
&gt; ahead<br/>
&gt;&gt; and carve, but I usually go over it all again on the rubber with a<br/>
&gt;&gt; very fine point black marker.  It doesn't smudge when you're<br/>
&gt; carving<br/>
&gt;&gt; and gives me sharper lines to carve along.  It sounds like a lot<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt;&gt; work but it's not really.  You'll have fun! Especially if there's<br/>
&gt;&gt; pie.<br/>
&gt;&gt; I bet some of these other folks have some great systems.  Anyone?!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; All kinds of weird things have happened in these little mountain towns!  I<br/>
&gt; have three in mind - I have to confirm one of the stories as truth (or<br/>
&gt; some semblance of at least) before I go ahead with that one...  and I have<br/>

&gt; seen she said not to worry about it.  But I'd really like to scoop<br/>
&gt; it up and send it to her.  I was going to post a note on the Little<br/>
&gt; Raven clues but didn't get a chance to do so in time.<br/>
&gt; I'll be coming that way sometime here soon and will swing by and get<br/>
&gt; it.. it sounds like it's in the box so it will surely be safe!<br/>
&gt; If someone goes up before then and wants to grab it for her, that'd<br/>
&gt; be wonderful, too!<br/>

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Woohoo! What a fun note..thanks so much!  Did you by any chance<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; spot<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a compass lying near the Little Raven box?  CWSunseeker dropped<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; her's there when she was stamping in.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Here's how I transfer for stamp carving.. I know it's not the<br/>
&gt; best<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; way but it works for me.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't been able to find one of the old type of copy<br/>
&gt; machines,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; so<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; had to go with plan b.  Or c or d depending on who you talk to.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I print out my design from the computer or draw it by hand.<br/>
&gt; When<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it's the way I want it I go over the lines with a pencil.  I<br/>
&gt; flip<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; it<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; onto the carving material, rub all over it back and forth and<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; down and swirly and jiggy with a blender pen that I got at an<br/>
&gt; art<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; store.  It's a clear fluid that's for transferring and<br/>
&gt; blending..I<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; just went into the art store and described it and they knew<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; exactly<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; what it was.  While it's still kind of damp I rub the back<br/>
&gt; with a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; folder thingie...the bone letter opener looking thing that you<br/>
&gt; use<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to fold paper for books, etc. (got it at a craft store).  You<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; use anything for that I suspect.  I used to do it without the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; blender stuff, and it will transfer.  But with the blender pen<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; get every smidge of pencil to transfer to the rubber (and some<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the ink from the computer).  At this point I know you could go<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; ahead<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and carve, but I usually go over it all again on the rubber<br/>
&gt; with a<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; very fine point black marker.  It doesn't smudge when you're<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; carving<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and gives me sharper lines to carve along.  It sounds like a<br/>
&gt; lot<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; work but it's not really.  You'll have fun! Especially if<br/>
&gt; there's<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; pie.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I bet some of these other folks have some great systems.<br/>
&gt; Anyone?!<br/>
