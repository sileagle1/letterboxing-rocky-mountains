                    <div class="plaintext-content">I guess you guys are talking about Grand Lake.  I have a morbid tale about<br>
Humphreys Store.  Is it still there?  I spent a summer working as an<br>
intern there oh.. maybe a hundred years ago. Ok maybe 20.. but it feels<br>
like more.  If I could plant a box upstairs in the second bedroom on the<br>
left... well maybe I will save it for another time.<br>
<br>
I guess I need to take a trip up in that area again.  Please do plant some<br>
boxes so that I have an excuse to go this summer.<br>

It's a lodgey type gift store now loaded with grrrreeeeattt stuff.  I have heard that it used to be a hotal and that the owner's mental stability was a bit questionable...<br>

I already have four boxes nearby (one in town) so do your c'mon Spring! dance and come on up!<br>

I guess you guys are talking about Grand Lake.  I have a morbid tale about<br>
Humphreys Store.  Is it still there?  I spent a summer working as an<br>

like more.  If I could plant a box upstairs in the second bedroom on the<br>
left... well maybe I will save it for another time.<br>

I guess I need to take a trip up in that area again.  Please do plant some<br>
boxes so that I have an excuse to go this summer.<br>
