you didn't PREsent yourself on list as having obtained your desired <br>
Christmas gift of a shovel with attachment, we assumed Santa didn't add <br>
it to your list in time!  I hate when that happens!  So, we had to make <br>
do on our own, since you had no attachments to lend out.  Cappy went to <br>
our local ACE hardware man and was able to buy the last remaining <br>
snowblower!  And, WOW, it makes a difference!  We got at least 8 inches <br>
and it bit thru it licky split!  More time now for doing the things we <br>
really enjoy....hhhmmmm....maybe some snowshoeing!<br>

Hugs, Peachie Peach with the clean driveway!<br>
