                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's a nice thought but really doesn't work too well for our state.  Things would be very tough to put into one of these areas because the major cities all lie along the interstates that divide the state north from south (I-70) and east from west (I-25).  Look at the Denver area for instance, would it be north, south, east, or west?  It probably lies where most people would consider the middle point of the state.  I would still stick with Front Range, Western slope, High Country, Southeastern Colorado, and Eastern Colorado.<br/>
