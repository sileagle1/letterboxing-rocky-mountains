yesterday, Aug. 6, to find the above boxes.  A beautifull spot!!  We <br/>
were not the first finders as Dixie and her Teammate made it up there <br/>
last weekend, but she did leave us a HH.  It was Pandy's Bear's <br/>
Angel.  We all stamped it and let Fiona take it with her.  This spot <br/>
in Bailey is goregous!!  I will update the placers, and yes, mention <br/>
the correction on FR550.  We thoguht that maybe the info that was <br/>
posted here was from someone who was just looking at a map, but low <br/>
and behold it was Miss Dixie who had just gotten this box!!  Thanks <br/>
for the info.  I know I said I thought the same, but when I got there <br/>
I went off of the clues.  We figured it out pretty quickly and got on <br/>
the right track.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the placers and thanks to Dixie for leaving us a record of <br/>
some of the more famous LBers!!  (I never thought that I would see <br/>
some of those stamps!!)<br/>

considered going up with your group, but, since I had a HH to plant, <br/>
I wanted so much for you guys to find it!  So, that's why I had to <br/>
be a bit sneaky about the note about 550!  You're right, we (Ron, my <br/>
husband) knew from experience!  But, we did have a map and <br/>
immediately questioned the clue because the map showed the trail <br/>
head on it.  Luckily it all worked out.  I wanted to warn you about <br/>
the bumpy dirt road, but, I didn't want to spoil the HH surprise! <br/>
Fiona, I hope you have as much fun planting it as we did!  <br/>
<br/>
Hugs, Dixie<br/>
