                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi folks, me again.  So after Autumn talked with Yahoo and I talked <br>
with Autumn and did a little of my own research, here's what I think is <br>
going on.  The Accelerade ad at the top of our page is linking to the <br>
atdmt.com web site to collect information on whoever is using the pages <br>
where the ad appears.  I'll let Autumn chime in whith the actual <br>
replies from Yahoo, but according to them, they have no control over <br>
the linkage to this site, but said the atdmt site is notorious for <br>
collecting information and they went as far as to call it a top spyware <br>
site or something, and also said they personally always block requests <br>
from atdmt.com.  Now this is funny, since one of their advertisers is <br>
linking to this "spyware" site.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, Autumn is going to go back to Yahoo and provide them some <br>
feedback on this advertiser, but I would advise everyone to use the <br>
security features in their browser to block cookies or other requests <br>
for information from atdmt.com.<br>

(I inquired about the ad on the moderator help list).  So far, no "official" word from Yahoo.  I get the ad, but I have Norton Utilities, and have had no issues so far.  Not sure at this point what we can do about the Accellerade ad, but meanwhile, if you use Yahoo, or any other community site (myspace, msn groups, etc.) it is wise to have good protection for your PC.<br>
