This is the posting to the main list that caused such an uproar.  <br>
I'll also forward some of the better responses.<br>

The family and I found the Witchcraft HH (nice franzsolo stamp!) <br>
nestled comfortably in an Owl's Nest at the Eastfork State Park in <br>
SW Ohio back in late May.  After spending a couple of months with us, <br>
she has now been set free again.<br>

I'm a bit taken back by this.  I realize that this is a free country, <br>
and that many people don't see the danger in witchcraft, but is a <br>
letterbox that glorifies the Occult proper for a family oriented <br>
hobby?  I'm particularly concerned that this letterbox is <br>
a "hitchhiker".  If I understand correctly, they are a surprise form <br>
of letterbox that travels around.  At least if it was fixed, those of <br>
us who did not want to be subjected to Satanic influences could avoid <br>
it.  If it is a surprise, it could show up in any letterbox.  I would <br>
like to suggest that this letterbox be withdrawn, or at a minimum be <br>
made a fixed letterbox.<br>
