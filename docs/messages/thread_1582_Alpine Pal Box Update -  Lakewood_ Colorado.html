                    <div class="plaintext-content">My sister e-mailed me that there was a 300 acre fire on Green Mountain <br/>
Monday night in Lakewood, Colorado which is an open space just to the <br/>
south of her home.  They even had to evacuate that night.  All is okay <br/>
now and no homes were lost.  They were able to return home on Tuesday.  <br/>
My sister planted the Alpine Pal Letterbox for me on a trail on Green <br/>
Mountain and we are assuming that it was probably consumed by the <br/>
fire.  For the time being the status of the box will remain unknown <br/>
until we can verify if it was destroyed or by some miracle it <br/>
survived.  <br/>
