with me this week..oh yeah and she used to live in Cripple Creek. <br>
This is the same friend with whom I went to Donkey Derby Days last <br>
year (google it for further ideas...which is where I'm Going with all <br>
of THIS...)<br>
<br>
Yeah like Treasure Hunting and the tag line below weren't enough:<br>
<br>
"Let us bring out the adventurer in you!  Our "Prospector's Treasure <br>
Hunt" is a fun and educational way to experience some of the <br>
historical attractions the area has to offer. "<br>
<br>
http://www.cripple-creek.co.us/TreasureHunt.aspx<br>
<br>
So for those of you interested in something potentially fun, check it <br>
out between now and 12/31/08.<br>
<br>
Now the topic of Stamps, get's me all worked up.  Indoor boxes at ALL <br>
those museums?  Can you say Mining History?  And.....hmmmmm<br>
<br>
While this Adventurer knows for a FACT that at least one letterbox is <br>
Up in Cripple Creek (pre sends ya - that song and all...yet another <br>
idea for a box)...I've always been stupenderized that there aren't <br>
(as far as I know) more boxes up that way.<br>
<br>
Czech out the links, think about it, do your PREsearch and all that <br>
please.  Then lemme know if you might want to erm...talk privately, <br>
>>collaborate<<, etc and so on...Say for placing about, say, early <br>
next spring and/or in time for 2009 Donkey Derby Days (I mean really, <br>
HOW can you pass up Chicken Poop Bingo??)<br>
<br>
Oh yeah and the train and outlaw topics are claimed, tyvm.<br>
<br>
pre<br>
Full of ideas...amongst other thingies don't ya know...<br>
