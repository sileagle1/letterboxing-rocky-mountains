<br/>
I just joined this group since we will be in the area for a short ski <br/>
vacation MAR 7-11.  We'll be in the Keystone/Copper Mtn/Breckenridge <br/>
area, staying at a condo in Silverthorne.<br/>
<br/>
Snow conditions will probably prevent us from finding many boxes (and <br/>
hey, we'll be skiing most of the time, right?), but we do plan to <br/>
bring our LB gear and a few clues along just in case.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any specific suggestions regarding boxes (or good <br/>
places to eat!), we'd appreciate the info.  And if any of you are in <br/>
that area and would like to get together for an exchange in the <br/>
evening on Saturday MAR 8, Sunday MAR 9 or Monday MAR 10, just let us <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
About us:  Wisconsin Hiker &amp; Martini Man have been boxing since July <br/>
2003 (heard about it from a friend) and have been obsessed ever <br/>
since.  We've found boxes in 23 states (and Scotland &amp; New Zealand) <br/>
and planted in 14 states (and New Zealand &amp; Mexico).  We've always <br/>
been avid hikers, but the added fun of "the hunt" really appeals to <br/>
us. We really enjoy the creativity of many of the clues &amp; stamps. <br/>
Letterboxing has taken us to some interesting locations and allowed <br/>
us to meet a bunch of great people across the USA!<br/>

Welcome to the Rockies!  You've chosen a beautiful place to vacation.<br/>
<br/>
I have a LB in Breckenridge that should be accessable even in the<br/>
winter:<br/>

<http: lboxes="" showboxinfo.html?gboxid="17095" www.atlasquest.com=""><br/>
<br/>
No hike involved, but you MUST use stealth!  I'll be watching for you to<br/>
log your find.<br/>
<br/>
I am jealous that Martini Man found the PZ Kut Kaper box in IL.  I was<br/>
through there last summer and gave it a try - but failed.  That was an<br/>
interesting mystery to follow.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your trip!<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

I've thought about this, and thought about this, and even asked my hubby how<br/>
you explain why GreenJello is such a funny trailname for someone from Utah.<br/>
<br/>
The best answer is that it's cultural, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
It's a joke that it's an unwritten rule that all church potlucks must have<br/>
jello salad of some sort. And in Utah, people get weird creative with jello.<br/>
Green jello with pears. Green jello with shredded carrots. Green jello with<br/>
cabbage. Green jello with zucchini. It's kind of like an inside joke, but<br/>
for all of Utah.<br/>
<br/>
The most popular Olympic pin in 2002 was the green jello pin. That sucker<br/>
sold for a LOT of money after they ran out. It still cracks me up!<br/>

And I'm jealous that you got one of the Olympic pins. It's the only one I<br/>
wanted, and by the time I had heard about it, they were selling for over<br/>
$200 each. Ouch.<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
