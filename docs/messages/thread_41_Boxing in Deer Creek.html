first 2 boxes!!  Yippee!!  We found the Deer Creek box and the Soar <br/>
Feet box.  Both boxes were in good condition, but haven't seen very <br/>
many visitors.  Trinity Jah at 31/2 was a trooper if I have ver seen <br/>
one.  She hiked 4 miles and only pitched a fit once!!  WHOOHOO!!  I <br/>
am very sore today as I haven't done anything of this magnitude in <br/>
about 6 years, but am totally excited to do more!! I will tell ya'all <br/>
that the hike up deer creek is a little bit difficult only because <br/>
most of the way up is rocky and kinda steep.<br/>

See ya'all soon!!<br/>

We call them "Sarahs". The Foreman gets a "Sarah" rating for <br/>
each hike. The Garden of the Gods got a 1 1/2 Sarah rating. <br/>
There was a bunch of whining on the way to the car.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Sarah refers to the silent screen actress Bernhart.<br/>
