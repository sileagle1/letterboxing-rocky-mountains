<br>
Just wanted to say that we had an excellent day boxing in Colorado <br>
Springs on Saturday - May 29th!  Albeit we got a late start, AND we <br>
went for some with long hikes, it was truly a great day!  Luckily we <br>
missed the rain!<br>
<br>
Found:<br>
<br>
"Chantress Letterbox" - Excellent rock formations!<br>
"SoC#2: Hairstreak Butterfly" - loved the 'make like a troll' clue<br>
"SoC#3: Lark Bunting" - First to find!  Apparently we took a <br>
shortcut, it turned out a quicker route with a storm looming upon us!<br>
"Pulpit Rock" - EXCELLENT!  If we had not eaten too much for lunch, <br>
we would have gone further!  I'll have to share a photo with you off-<br>
list.  I'm sure you'd approve - ha!<br>
<br>
All of these are in great shape!  <br>
<br>
I'd also like to mention that JelyBean has EXCELLENT clues!  We <br>
really enjoyed figuring them out before finding the box!  Keep up <br>
the great work that you do with your stamps and clues!  Kudos!<br>
<br>
We're not done with power caching in the Springs!  We WILL be back!  <br>
Say, I wonder if any of you CO. Springs boxers ever head to Denver <br>
for boxing????  Would love to see your names in our logbooks!  <br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the kind words and updates.  The lark, yes there is a <br>
shortcut or two, we went that way because it let us spend a little <br>
more time in the woods.  I don't think I'm giving anything away, <br>
once you get there and look at the trail map, you can pretty much <br>
figure it out.<br>
<br>
We (Princess Tulip, goddess and I) will start in on Denver soon, <br>
having found all the boxes in the Springs.  Until then,<br>
<br>
Happy 'Boxing<br>
