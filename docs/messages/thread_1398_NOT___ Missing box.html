PS - Sorry for the late post.  Been camping in the mountains of UT with<br/>

&gt; Ok gang for once I get to be the bearer of GREAT news! I checked on<br/>
&gt; this box after work tonight and .......found it RIGHT where it was<br/>
&gt; supposed to be!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ....And I gotta say that since it was all the way back in last April<br/>
&gt; when I found it that ...erm.....running across goats in that<br/>
&gt; park .....is ummm...well "really random."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I "only" got to meet lots and lots of doggies out for their evening<br/>
&gt; walks with there "staff". Extremely fitting for that box.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boxer Lover: Please contact me off list. Your logbook is getting full<br/>
&gt; and I'd like to work with you to see how'd you'd like to handle that.<br/>
&gt; I'm your gal on that end of things as well. :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; If one of you Denver-area boxers<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; happens to be down around the Cherry Creek area, could you check<br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; it?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Much appreciation!<br/>
