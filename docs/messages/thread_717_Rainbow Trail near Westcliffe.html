Trail LB by Edna.  The plastic shoebox was quite visible from the trail<br/>
inviting many non-letterboxers to check it out and sign the<br/>
stenographer's pad within.  It appears that the original stamp went<br/>
missing long ago.  It appears that only one party had stamps at all<br/>
(manufactured ones), so they left one of their stamps behind.  We didn't<br/>
bother stamping in the unrelated stamp into our logbooks, nor did we<br/>
stamp into the LB logbook.  We did cover it a little better.  I will send<br/>
a note to Edna.  Does anyone know if this is an abandoned box?  There was<br/>
another LB in the area with a bigger hike and we didn't have time to do<br/>
it.  Edna is also the owner of that one.<br/>

If you do find out anything more about the other box or Edna, would you <br/>
let me know? I have always been curious about these two letterboxes. <br/>
They have been around for a while, haven't they?<br/>
<br/>
I've only been to that side of the Sangre de Christo mountains once but <br/>
I remember it as being really spectacular. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info,<br/>
