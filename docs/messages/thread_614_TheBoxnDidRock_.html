I think Y said it all! What an exciting day! And to think, some are <br>
out there boxing again today!<br>
<br>
Thank you sooooo much, everyone who put in the miles to come play <br>
with us! I think fun was had by all, and we tried hard to stuff <br>
Elros and DSOTM with as much pie as was possible. <br>
<br>
And to those who brought along non-boxing spouses and friends, thank <br>
them for their patience during our frenzy of stamp exchanges. My <br>
head is still reeling from that experience! LOL!<br>
<br>
And.... thank you, Y, for your beautiful event stamp, clap clap <br>
clap, well done! It was so good to finally meet you and the boys in <br>
person!<br>
<br>
And....... oh boy, new stamps being planted. How sooo cool is that! <br>
I can't wait to go find the one at Little Wild Horse Canyon! It's <br>
ALWAYS good to have a reason to play in that canyon!<br>
<br>
And..........It's good to realize that there are people out there <br>
that possibly have a deeper addiction to this than myself! Wow! LOL!<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone for sooo much fun and your beautiful stamps!<br>
