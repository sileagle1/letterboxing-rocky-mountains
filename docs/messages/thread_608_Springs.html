Sheepishly admits that I read that message sooooo wrong!  I was talking about getting together in Moab.  I suck!  I don't think that I will make it to the springs on the 30th but might be persuaded to come down another time and box with the southern contingent!  I would love to meet everybody and definetly exchange stamps with JelyBean!!!  ...hear some adventures from your trip that I am SOOO jealous of!  We should try to plan it maybe around Juneish???  so my littles are out of school and I have a chance of taking some time off of work?  I was just thinking today that I have a stamp that I must MUST (moral imperative here) plant down there.  I know that the firefighter memorial is a fairly manicured park but do you think I could plant a box near it somewhere?<br>
 <br>
Lets plan something!<br>
