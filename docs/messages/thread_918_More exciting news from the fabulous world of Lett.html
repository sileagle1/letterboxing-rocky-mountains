                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, it's not all that exciting. I just thought I should let everyone <br>
know that clues and the hiding spot have changed for the Three Keys <br>
letterbox in Durango, Colorado.<br>
<br>
So if anyone was planning on looking for that, they need to print up a <br>
new sheet.<br>
<br>
There were just too many wrong turns possible when solving the first <br>
set of clues. And the hiding spot made it a little hard to be discreet <br>
when re-hiding.<br>
<br>
I would like to congratulate those people who solved the first set and <br>
welcome them to stamp in again if they get a chance to visit it's new <br>
location.<br>
<br>
Happy Trails,<br>
