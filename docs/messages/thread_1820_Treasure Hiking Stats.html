                    <div class="plaintext-content">Regarding accumulating miles for Treasure Hiking, if a box is only listed on LBNA, do you still get to log it on AQ in the Treasure Hiking stats?  <br/>
Also, what about LBs that you attempted but could not find?  Our example is an LB that really had bad directions (both mileage AND description were SO bad and the only people that had "Found" this LB were the ones that had planted it over a year ago).  This particular box would have been a 3 mi. RT hike. <br/>
And, if you go for a longer hike after finding the box that mileage doesn't count in the stat-- only the distance to the box? <br/>
If there's no distance listed on the clue, can we use the distance measured by a GPS?<br/>

Yes, you can count boxes that are on LBNA, but no, you cannot count attempts. I'm not sure why the original treasure hikers went that way, but that's their rules. And no, you cannot count additional distance. Some people carry a box with them to plant so if they can't find a box or want to hike more they can plant a new box and count the mileage. I've notice that clues in CO don't tend to list distance. In GA the trend is to list distance and elevation change, so you know what type of hike you are getting into. I've never used a GPS so I didn't know that they could give you distance on a hike. That's great, I need to get one! Use whatever means work for you to calculate distance. I can't imagine anyone cheating and adding mileage since they would only be cheating themselves.<br/>
