Silent Wings arrived with Peach and Cappy on Thursday until the last <br>
goodbye to the last letterboxer, Boxer Lover, on Sunday night it was a <br>
non-stop smile-a-thon for me.  Y'all are seriously the coolest grownups <br>
I have ever met.  Anyone who will pick up a hitchhiker sitting on top <br>
of a roll of TP is my friend forever.  I won't soon forget the sight of <br>
people wandering around the yard looking under flamingos and in coffins <br>
for letterboxes.  Suh.. WEET!  And I also will never forget the sight <br>
of Skeetch coming out of the bushes carrying that coffin in the state <br>
park where Peach and Cappy had hidden it!  WOOT!  Arrrrr!!<br>
<br>
Chocolate silk pies... peach cobbler... mmmmmm!!<br>
<br>
If anyone ever needs the perfect helper just give a shout to Silent <br>
Wings.  She just bustles around doing everything that needs doing with <br>
a smile.  I never would have been ready without all her help.  Plus, <br>
she's so sweet about the merciless teasing we gave her about her <br>
perfect stamping techniques!  And all the time we were teasing her we <br>
were lining up to have her ink the stamp for OUR books because she does <br>
it so well.  Of course, we all owe her for life, but, man those stamps <br>
look good! Good enough.  hehehehehe.  <br>
<br>
I was so tired on the last flight home tonight then I remembered <br>
sitting around the old school stamping into Napoleon Dynamite and all <br>
of us giggling and having so much fun that a passing stranger asked us <br>
if we were rolling a joint.  Which made me chuckle out loud in the dark <br>
plane and the long day wasn't so long anymore.  <br>
<br>
The pictures are making me start to smile all over again.  Thanks for <br>
making it such a great weekend.  I honestly can't wait until the next <br>
time!<br>
<br>
Kat, we missed you and there were lots of sad sounds when people found <br>
out you weren't coming.  And more sad sounds when they found out how <br>
sick you were!  Get well soon and come and play on Mount Doom!<br>

Sorry we couldn't make it out west this time around. Sounds like you <br>
all had a FABOO time - and who wouldn't with Es at the helm! (Almost <br>
didn't recognise her without her pirate garb on!)<br>
<br>
Great pictures - we are very bummed that we couldn't have met the <br>
Catamount Carvers and some of the other (I am positive) fabulous boxers <br>
in the RM area. <br>
<br>
*sigh* next time - next time.<br>

boxer!!! Sounds like it was as fun as I knew it would be, sniff, <br>
sniff (trying not to cry over missing the event). I had boxes to <br>
share, cooties to sneak, pie to be eaten........ so we'll have to do <br>
it all over again soon!!!! And.... everyone gets style points for <br>
looking too cool while boxing in a convertible!!! I thought of <br>
everyone on Saturday while I watched Napolean Dynamite on HBO.<br>

not strep!)<br>
