I've been avoiding getting a blog for a while now since I felt my <br>
website would serve me better, but I keep running out of space on <br>
geocities and I'd like somewhere to post pictures that I can use on <br>
LB sites and on the Carving Consortium site.<br>
<br>
I decided to make it a letterboxing themed blog.  I don't have tons <br>
of info on it, but I will update it from time to time with <br>
letterboxing adventures I have or images of carvings.  I thought you <br>
might all be interested in seeing it.  Let me know what you think.<br>

A blog is like a website with a slightly different format.  It works<br>
sort of like an online journal where I can go in and make regular<br>
posts about what is happening or areas of interest to me.  So I<br>
thought, "what better to be of interest to me than letterboxing?"  If<br>
you've gone to Mark and Sue Pepe's site, it is actually a blog, not<br>
just a website.  If you haven't gone, you need to.  It is a great<br>
site.  They have also started to collaborate with Atlas Quest to show<br>
links to each other's sites.  I'm also writing Ryan to see if I might<br>
be able to add a LB search box to my site like they have.  Wouldn't<br>
that be cool?<br>
<br>
Here is the Pepe's site<br>
http://markandsuepepe.blogspot.com/<br>
this is mine (it doesn't have nearly as much info in it yet)<br>
http://letterboxing.blogspot.com/<br>
<br>
Does that help?<br>
