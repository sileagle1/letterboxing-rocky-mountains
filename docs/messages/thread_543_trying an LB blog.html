I've been avoiding getting a blog for a while now since I felt my <br/>
website would serve me better, but I keep running out of space on <br/>
geocities and I'd like somewhere to post pictures that I can use on <br/>
LB sites and on the Carving Consortium site.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to make it a letterboxing themed blog.  I don't have tons <br/>
of info on it, but I will update it from time to time with <br/>
letterboxing adventures I have or images of carvings.  I thought you <br/>
might all be interested in seeing it.  Let me know what you think.<br/>

A blog is like a website with a slightly different format.  It works<br/>
sort of like an online journal where I can go in and make regular<br/>
posts about what is happening or areas of interest to me.  So I<br/>
thought, "what better to be of interest to me than letterboxing?"  If<br/>
you've gone to Mark and Sue Pepe's site, it is actually a blog, not<br/>
just a website.  If you haven't gone, you need to.  It is a great<br/>
site.  They have also started to collaborate with Atlas Quest to show<br/>
links to each other's sites.  I'm also writing Ryan to see if I might<br/>
be able to add a LB search box to my site like they have.  Wouldn't<br/>
that be cool?<br/>
