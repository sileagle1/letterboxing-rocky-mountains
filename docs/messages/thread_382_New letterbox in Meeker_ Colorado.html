I *finally* was able to make the drive up to Meeker, Colorado today <br/>
and what an incredible time of the year for it!  The colors are <br/>
just.... wow....and the day was made for a drive. :)<br/>
<br/>
I also got brave enough to ask and the 'That'll Do, Dan' letterbox <br/>
is now safely tucked into the White River Museum in Meeker.  <br/>
Although that limits the time you can find it, it was just too <br/>
wonderful of a place to pass up.  Any of you who wander up there <br/>
will enjoy the museum... I was shocked at how much <br/>
incredible 'stuff' they have in there!  The lady who was working <br/>
today knew absolutely everything there was to know about everything <br/>
in there plus had endless knowledge of the area.. and was happy to <br/>
chat and answer questions. <br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone is having a very stampy-riffic weekend!<br/>
