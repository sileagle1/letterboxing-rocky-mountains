Finally had some time to check on the old box and/or replace it, so I headed down to the area today. Unfortunately, there was too much snow for me to even check the old spot, much less rehide it in the same location, so I moved my replacement box. :)<br>

Sorry if you tried to find it before & couldn't, but now's your chance to find it! It's findable with a bit of snow on the ground. Make sure you reprint your clues before heading out, though. I couldn't find a rock to really hide the box very well, only leaves, so if the next boxer to look for it can take a medium-size rock with them to cover it up better, I'd appreciate it!<br>
