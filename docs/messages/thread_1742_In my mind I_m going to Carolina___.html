I feel your pain.  I am dreaming, longing, and pining away for letterboxing this summer.  Alas - it is just not a boxing summer for me.   I did want to say that I saw Dick & Peg recently (TaiChi & Chai Tea) and they reported finding their 1000th box!  What an accomplishment!  Yay!<br>
<br>
Missing the trails, and wishing you all happy trails with boxes at the end of each one! <br>
