For those that were at the Twin Falls Gathering on Saturday I though <br>
I would send along the recipe for the Roosevelt Beans I brought <br>
along.  This was the recipe I received from the Roosevelt Lodge in <br>
Yellowstone National Park.  I made a double batch for the gathering.  <br>
I cooked the meat and onions and then tossed everything into the <br>
crock pot instead of the oven since were on the road for the <br>
gathering.  Also I was not able to find the exact size can of beans <br>
the recipe called for so I used the sizes that I was able to find.<br>
<br>
1 lb. Hamburger or Sausage<br>
 lb. Bacon Diced<br>
1 Onion Diced <br>
1 16 oz. can Pork and Beans<br>
1 12 oz. can Kidney Beans <br>
1 12 oz. can Lima Beans<br>
1 12 oz. can Butter Beans<br>
 Cup Brown Sugar<br>
2 Tbsp. Cider Vinegar<br>
1 Tbsp. Prepared Mustard<br>
 Cup Ketchup<br>
Salt and Pepper to Taste<br>
<br>
Fry meats.  Drain fat.  Sautee onions with meat. Stir in next 10 <br>
ingredients.  For a thicker dish, drain liquid from beans.  Bake at <br>
325 for 45 minutes.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!  Blackvelvetrav & Lizman<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
