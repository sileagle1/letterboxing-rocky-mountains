Scarab sent me an email regarding it - and I was pretty twitterpated to<br>
have found that box, since I really could have done any of them while<br>
there -but we picked that one because it was an Urban Box that we thought<br>
we could do quickly.<br>

We didn't know anything about the NPR spot at the time.  Go figure!<br>
