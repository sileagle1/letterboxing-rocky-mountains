gotcha!  I assumed as much, but I've learned to be careful sometimes <br>
with these lists :)<br>
<br>
Yes, it was the Salmon I rafted this summer.  I went down the Middle <br>
Fork, and breathtaking is the right word.  My friend I took with me <br>
has a book of 100 things to do before you die and rafting the Middle <br>
Fork is one of them.  It was a wonderful experience!!  Also, I left a <br>
letterbox out there and it is inaccesible by car or foot, so maybe <br>
that will motivate some of you to head up into my neck of the woods! <br>
