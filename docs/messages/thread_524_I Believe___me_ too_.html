I too, totally believe, and I believe my psycho hound, "Lulu" is a <br/>
direct descendant from the aliens. The eerie baying sounds she makes <br/>
as she runs up to the towers is a verbal cue that unlocks strange <br/>
secret doors just off the courtyard near the citadel. Oh, the <br/>
secrets we have seen in there........But..... don't tell anyone <br/>
outside our little circle here. I think the men in suits might be on <br/>
to us, they fly overhead, pretending to be search and rescue, but <br/>
Lulu and I, we know who they REALLY are!!!! <br/>

While I was hunting around for evidence that "We Are Not Alone" I <br/>
came upon some other interesting treasures. I found Desert Bighorn, <br/>
Paddle Hard, Searching....., and Colorado River letterboxes <br/>
yesterday, all along the River Road between Moab and Cisco. There are <br/>
a total of seven very nice letterboxes accessed on this road now by <br/>
five different letterboxers. It's also one of the most spectacular <br/>
landscapes in the world. A person could spend most of an <br/>
unforgettable day finding them all. I think the first person to find <br/>
them all in one day should have the honor of naming the tour. <br/>
Something like "Grand Tour de CiscoMoMo", or hopefully something <br/>
better.<br/>

Es, I think I recognize that dancing foot to foot, is it the Disco-<br/>
Cisco-a-Mo-MO? Big LOL! You're safe today, too much work around here <br/>
to be done in the rain! But.... I feel the aliens sending me <br/>
vibes.... to head their way!<br/>
