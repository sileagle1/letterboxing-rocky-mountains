along with the Yahoo prompts and it was much simpler than I imagined!<br>
<br>
Colored pens ... Boxer Lover had the amazing fatter tipped pens, but they<br>
were the same brand as mine.  I previously purchased a cheaper set and<br>
they were worthless.  Of course, TDG gets good results with Crayola<br>
markers ... do I have the brand right TDG?  The brand Boxer Lover and I<br>
use is Le Plume and they are acid free, if that is important to you.  I<br>
bought mine in a set (Le Plume II), and needed to add on a black and<br>
brown marker.  I found that Boxer Lover had a nice flesh tone marker, so<br>
I'm getting that next.  No more jaundice looks for the people that show<br>
up in stamps!  I think that Boxer Lover also had a nice, brighter yellow<br>
than mine.  I'm thinking that it might be better to just buy them<br>
individually, so you can get the colors you prefer (brighter is my<br>
preference).  Any advice on  your end Boxer Lover or TDG?<br>

And this is one that does NOT need multi-colored pens. Just beautiful!<br>
