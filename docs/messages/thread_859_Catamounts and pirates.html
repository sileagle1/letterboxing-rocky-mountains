thing!<br/>
<br/>
Skeetch and I were walking up the hill to check on The Black Pearl this <br/>
afternoon when we heard a car door down on the road below us.. we <br/>
stopped peer over the edge of the hill and saw a truck and trailer <br/>
backing up the road!!  As we watched, we heard a voice from below, 'Are <br/>
you Esmerelda?!'  It was the Catamount Carvers who had spied my car and <br/>
the pirate flag!  Woot!<br/>
<br/>
Soon we were sharing letterboxing stories and journals and I was having <br/>
a little thing we like to call a dang good time.  <br/>
<br/>
This is such a great hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Esmerelda, loaded down with letterboxing goodies and a wonderful pirate <br/>
gift and even more excited about next weekend<br/>
<br/>
