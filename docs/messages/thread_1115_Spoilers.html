I would just like to say that I am against posting photographs of <br>
someone else's letterbox location, logbook, or stamp on the internet <br>
without permission.<br>
<br>
Trip reports, with photos of the outing, can be done with discretion <br>
and are a lot of fun to read. But any images that give away locations <br>
or show stamp images can basically ruin the letterboxing experience for <br>
the finder.<br>
<br>
If I see any image or description on the internet of one of my <br>
letterboxes I'll retrieve them. And if I see stamp images of other <br>
letterboxes, that is "Game Over" for me and I will search elsewhere for <br>
an adventure that I don't already know the ending to.<br>
<br>
y-nought, not meaning to sound grouchy, but spoiling MY fun is a very <br>
serious matter......<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For myself, I'm not really talking about anything specific.I have <br>
just noticed a trend where stamp images are showing up on personal <br>
letterboxing websites along with some pretty detailed descriptions of <br>
the hiding place, which spoils the game for many seekers. <br>
<br>
It has become such a problem in some areas that many of the <br>
letterboxers no longer publish clues on any of the websites and you <br>
have to "know" someone to get clues.<br>
<br>
I would hate to see that happen here. I think that one of the great <br>
things about letterboxing is that most clues are accessible to anyone.<br>
<br>
But in the end all I can do is state my opinion, which I did, hoping <br>
to start a discussion in case there are some folks in this group who <br>
are considering this.<br>
<br>
It's just my opinion, though, and the future of letterboxing may <br>
feature more published stamp images and less published clues.<br>
