I'll try to carve another. But I'm not sure when I'll get a chance to <br>
replace it.<br>
<br>
I have a suspicion that a dog smelled it and dug it up. There are a lot <br>
of dogs on that trail.....and it looked like all the rocks and sticks <br>
had been dug out of the nook.<br>
<br>
That logbook had a lot of great stamps and had been visited more than <br>
any of my other letterboxes (Ouch!). It's strange to say, but I am kind <br>
of getting used to this sort of thing...<br>

Chaos and Mayhem tour and loved it.  We jumped the creek (well, I did, <br>
while OMGB TRIED) and stamped in.  Beautiful!  It's a terrible shame <br>
when a logbook full of entires disappears!<br>

that tree was the personification of the tale - has gone astray. And <br>
the log book! And the stamp! (I have just now revisited the fine <br>
stamp in my own log book.) Even the ceramic jar. My sympathies, y. 8~(<br>
