I updated the clues based on the information Boxer Lover gave me.  BUT, <br/>
I'd give him up in a minute to get Esmie's Westerns box back!  It is <br/>
one of our very favorites!  Dern that scalliwag who took off with <br/>
it...be it critter or man!  <br/>
<br/>
Hugs to you, me heartie, Esmie!  Maybe PRE is right and he was just <br/>
pulled for stamping, or maybe the magnificent Kat will find him strayed <br/>
just a bit to another rock.  Hope, hope!<br/>
<br/>
Jest Peach, who sends ES a comfort HUG and cup of arbuckles and pie <br/>
while she waits for Kat to check on the box!<br/>

Heavens.. don't sacrifice the pup for the Westerns!  I have high <br/>
hopes that Kat will find it drug off into the bushes somewhere!  But <br/>
how fun to find out the journal was almost full.  I pretty much never <br/>
get updates from people about it but it sounds like it's had a few <br/>
visitors out there.  Maybe some guys with a giant black ball full of <br/>
nuclear waste grabbed it and carried it around in a helicopter to <br/>
Choke Canyon. It could happen. <br/>
<br/>
But now it is MY turn to be so sad to report a missing.  Kat.. <br/>
Skeetch was driving me to work and we both did a huge gasp and <br/>
said, 'the letterbox!' at the same time.  They've just started <br/>
construction at the airport for a roundabout and guess what area just <br/>
got bulldozed?!  DANG IT!!  I have no idea where they hauled all the <br/>
rocks and dirt to or I'd go dig through it to find your box.  That <br/>
was SUCH a beautiful stamp!  I'll make a new plant to box in Moab in <br/>
it's memory.  I'm sorry!!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am wishing and hoping you can find The Westerns down some critter's <br/>
hole, Kat.  A letterboxing mole perhaps?  I was sorry to be in such a <br/>
rush last weekend not to spend more time searching.  There's nothing <br/>
would please me more than to be wrong about that 'box missing!  There <br/>
were 2 fist-sized rocks lying in the grass outside the hole-under-the-<br/>
rock, but the hole was completely empty.  Maybe Pre's idea about <br/>
a 'boxer taking it away to stamp in unobserved is correct.  I sure hope <br/>
so!  Kat, please post here your findings after you've had a chance to <br/>
look.  And make it, "I found it!"<br/>
