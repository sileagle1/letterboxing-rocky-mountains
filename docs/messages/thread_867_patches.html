i noticed the three different designs for a patch for the rocky <br>

with all the talk lately about patches, dont you all think its about <br>
time for this group to have our own patch??<br>
should we just go with the designs we already have ? or should we try <br>
and get some other designs? and have a poll??<br>
any thoughts??<br>
we can get patches for no start up cost, but with a minimum order of <br>
100 patches.<br>
shall we get this going again?? any more ideas? we could expand on the <br>

 how about it?<br>

one...now to decide...hhhmmmmmm.....decisions, decisions...<br>
<br>
If there are any artists out there, I'd love to see one with the <br>
mountains in the background, then a layer of trees...evergreen, aspen, <br>
and then in the forefront a trail that curves from the front edge and <br>
leads into the trees with a couple of simple shape people hiking on the <br>
trail...shadows of people almost.  And then Rocky Mtn. Letterboxing <br>
either at the top, or bottom.  Can anyone do that?  LOL...aren't you <br>
happy I have an idea but no picture/drawing!?!  I can try to sketch one <br>
out, but, I thought a REAL artist out there could do a better job.  <br>
<br>
Plus, I like the script font rather than the heavy block font.  The <br>
compass icon could still show up at the top, if you like. <br>
<br>
Whatever the patch is, we'd take a couple!<br>
<br>
Hugs, Peach<br>

I think I'll go ahead and handle the selling and will likely take a few prepaid orders to help cover the cost and then order extras to have available.  Cool?<br>
   <br>
  And I'll make sure that the compass points are true.  I love being an airhead.  *snort*  I get so caught up in the lines and the sound of the pencil on the paper that details escape me sometimes.  But the end product is usually worth it.  :)<br>
