 Gaura,    No Way! MTV used to show music videos???? Actually I <br>
remember watching the same ones over and over and over. But that was <br>
back when the alternative was to play Pong.<br>
<br>
I've fallen a little behind because I have been plowing snow since <br>
4:00 AM. Here are the next batch of clues:<br>
<br>
11. It's west of The Record Man. ( You gussed, a store on the east <br>
side of town).<br>
<br>
12. To the challenge you must rise, don't have sad eyes. (Up in the <br>
air again. Also we have a Smiley Building in the center of town).<br>
<br>
13. It's really not all that far.<br>
<br>
14. John Elway for a day.<br>
<br>
15. Taco Nite is all right. (Old Timers Bar has taco nite every <br>
Friday).<br>
<br>
16. It's east of the Power Plant. (An old power plant is being <br>
renovated in the same area of town that we seem to be zeroing in on).<br>
<br>
17 It's Santa Rita all over again. (Santa Rita is a park in town that <br>
got re-named from Gateway Park to reflect it's history. The power <br>
plant is being re-named. The Smiley building was re-named.)<br>
<br>
    I have been checking up on every idea that you folks have been <br>
kind enough to throw out there. Someone said they found it last <br>
evening, but it was a false alarm. Also, the DJ said that every clue <br>
is a valid hint and that if we could get the reference we would know <br>
EXACTLY where it is by now. I really believe we have narrowed it down <br>
to a 3 or 4 block area, but I don't know where to look in that area <br>
yet. The folks that thought they got it were a few miles from where I <br>
think it is.<br>
<br>
     I always thought that when I found this thing would also be when <br>
Javelinas fly. Maybe this is the year???!!!<br>
