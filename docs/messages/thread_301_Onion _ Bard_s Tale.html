I would have responded earlier to the question of teaming up and trying this Tale, but I was out of town and have just gotten a sec to relay some thoughts (MAYBE!!!)  My hope was to get together with that team and maybe give up the ideas that I have received from my mom who just really got into this LB thang!!  Yes, I have some idea of where this may be but have not had the chance to drive the "route" and see if our ideas are worthy or not.  Should any of you in "The Team" want to discuss ideas, please e-mail.  Just to put this note in, I have made the life changing decision to move out of this state, so if we are to get together and try, time is growing short for my input.  Hope to hear from ya'all soon!!<br/>

  Silver Eagle is from Texas - and I'm not sure about the Catamount <br/>
  carvers.<br/>
<br/>
  But the HH they left in the Onion LB was kinda neat, and I'll be sure <br/>
  to forward it on ASAP. =3<br/>

  &gt; I'll jump in here and say that Catamount Carvers told me it was the <br/>

  &gt; couple of boxes I found recently on the Front Range. I don't know <br/>
  &gt; where they live, nor do I remember which logbooks I saw them in. <br/>
  Nice <br/>
  &gt; scoop, though. And well done to the Catamount Carvers too.<br/>
