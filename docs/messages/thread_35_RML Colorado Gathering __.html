Saturday gathering.  August 23 or Aug 30 seem to be the dates that <br/>

I'd love to arrange a picnic gathering one of those weekends.  <br/>
Potluck lunch, with some boxing as well!  If anyone would like to <br/>
demonstrate stamp carving tips, or anything - that would be lovely.  <br/>
We can meet to exchange stamps, hike for a box ... perhaps plant <br/>
another box?  <br/>

I'm actually considering making a personal traveler for the event, <br/>
but I haven't decided what you'd have to "do" to earn the stamp.  Tee <br/>

Places suggested so far include Roxborough State Park (yes, there's a <br/>
$6 fee if you don't have an annual pass) and also Deer Creek Park.<br/>
<br/>
Who can make it?  <br/>

I want to meet more of you that box in the state ... and maybe even <br/>
coax Cadenza out of Idaho?  :)<br/>

the 30th is the Labor day weekend and the sites may be more <br/>
crowded.  Just a thought! Also, I know that Roxborough has a $6.00 <br/>
pass fee but I have to tell you it's beautiful! If you've never been <br/>
there, it's a Must Do!<br/>
