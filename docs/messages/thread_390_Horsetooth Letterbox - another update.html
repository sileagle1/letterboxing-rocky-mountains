Howdy folks -<br>
<br>
Good news this time - it seems that Horsetooth Mountain Park will <br>
eventually allow letterboxes under a "special event" permit.  The <br>
policy is currently being revised; apparently they had some bad <br>
experiences with geocachers, and their current policy is based on <br>
that (at this time, NOTHING is allowed to be placed in the park, so <br>
please don't plant anything without contacting the park first!).  <br>
But, in time, I think the Horsetooth Letterbox will be legally <br>
replaced in its hidey-hole by Horsetooth Falls.  I'll keep you <br>
posted as I find out more, and will let you know later if the new <br>
policy is just for Horsetooth Mountain Park or pertains to all of <br>
Larimer County Open Space or Parks or whatever.<br>
<br>
Yippee!!<br>

That is good news! I must tell all of you that the Horsetooth Letterbox<br>
is a great hike, nicely crafted, and we loved the placement of it!  Yes,<br>
it will be nice to have it back and it is sounding very hopeful that it<br>
will once again be available.<br>
