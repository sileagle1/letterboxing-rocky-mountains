                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, we came back home a day early to try and relax from our vacation.  Funny how that works out huh?!  Anyway, we had quite a few great finds on our trip including:<br>
Wheel of the year - Yule - nice location and lucky the hike isn't bad at that elevation.<br>
Yes - beat out by Catamount carvers by 1.5 hours for the first finder.  Truly amazing carving!!!<br>
WOM in Silverthorne - 1st finder besides the bride and groom.<br>
Cabin Sweet Cabin - Another first finder.  Definatly the toughest of all of these boxes!  My wife says to recommend against wearing flip flops and taking kids under 5.<br>
Woof Woof - Easy find near Breckenridge.<br>
Summit Hummer - Certainly did not guess the stamps image from this name but I guess it makes sense.  Nice area.<br>
Bear Gone Fishing - Very nice views of Lake Dillon!  A wedding was going on when we were there.<br>
Arkansas Headwaters - Be careful of the cars flying by as you stamp in.<br>
Here Comes the Sun - If you fish, bring your poles.<br>
For the Benefit of Mr. Kite - I always loved the Beatles!<br>
Long and Winding Road - This way my favorite box of the week as you actually take the chairlift to the summit.  Beautiful and HIGHLY recommended!<br>
Payne Gulch BKC - Beautiful and not too tough for the young ones.<br>
The Dragon's Lair - Great carving!<br>
Abert's Squirrel Letterbox and Parasite Box - Not as long as the directions make it sound.  We started packing the kids in but they walked back without any problems.<br>
The Grand Timber Letterbox - Oh wait...that's the one that I planted while up there.  Not to strenuous and hopefully you will all love it as I did while carving.<br>
<br>
Beware - before attempting the Lake County Pre Calc box please contact the placer.  We drove a fair distance solely for this box but came up confused and empty handed.  I have not heard from the placer yet in regard to the box but it was placed as part of a high school pre calculus class and may not be there.  Also, the clues seem better reading them at home than when you get there....which in most cases is generally the opposite.<br>
<br>
Thanks to all that placed these fine boxes!<br>
