Well, did your taste it? What is the dragonfruit snack? And where is <br/>
everyone? Did you get the storm in CO as bad as we did here in Utah?<br/>
Went down with out of town friends Friday in a snowstorm and found <br/>
Kokopelli of the Ruins, but it was to windy and snowy to really <br/>
enjoy the ruins! We hid inside for a while but the storm only got <br/>
worse!!<br/>

I haven't tasted it.  I'm waiting for a report.  But next time I get <br/>
to the Trader's I'll pick some up and let y'all know if pirates like <br/>
Dragonfruit.  I know they like pie. <br/>
<br/>
It was pretty cold and nasty here most of the weekend, but I was <br/>
working all but a little bit of it and it was really nice in Phoenix <br/>
and Mexico. <g>  We did have some of the worst turbulence I've ever <br/>
been in coming back into Junction, though, so it was very stormy. <br/>
You all had a snowstorm?!  I see snow up in the mountains, but we <br/>
haven't had it down where I am yet.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm on reserve today, but I may sneak out and check on Big Fish.. I <br/>
hear that someone from Moab recently visited it. :)  I'll do my best <br/>
to find another hiding place for it.  For some reason I thought <br/>
Nightshade kept it's leaves all winter.  Who knew?  <br/>
<br/>
I'm working on some new boxes and staying warm by the fire. What's <br/>
everyone else up to?  Y-nought.. did you ever hear anything about <br/>
the Onion?  <br/>
<br/>
Esmerelda, going out to throw another log on the fire and hoping <br/>
someone makes a dragonfruit box. <br/>

My contact at Jeffco was gone all last week. This morning she gave me <br/>
the adress of the Ranger I need to talk to, but he won't be <br/>
back 'till tomorrow. But it sounds like he will tell me where I can <br/>
place Onion II. And we will use the same permit.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't know that dragons bear fruit. I hope it isn't like an onion.<br/>
<br/>
The weather was nasty in Durango on Friday too. But when I went to <br/>
Indian Creek on Saturday, I think I saw more snow on the La Sals than <br/>
on the San Juans.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just talked with a ranger at Roxborough State Park regarding letterboxes.  <br/>
I have two up there and was told state parks were OK.  She said they do not <br/>
like boxes because people tramp all over the place - I quickly told her how <br/>
this should not happen with good clues, etc.  She said next January or <br/>
February they will have a new Ranger at Rox and he/she will be making a <br/>
final decision.  I am hoping they will let our boxes stay - told them about <br/>
how Jeffco handles it.  Even offered to find each box and give a good <br/>
description of where they were and if they were on a good spot.  This is <br/>
about all I can do<br/>

It looks really cool, round with black seeds and it is a bright magenta color dried...  at first bite it tastes really good, kinda like strawberries but then I dunno if it is the seeds (there are a lot of them) or what but then it is actually pretty nasty.  Oh well, gotta try it.<br/>
<br/>
Got whalloped by the same storm twice.  LA was a total mess, got about 5 inches of rain just the first night.  Then got hit by the same storm again in snow form when I got back to CO.  *shrugs* whatcha gonna do?  ...hide and warm by the fire!<br/>
