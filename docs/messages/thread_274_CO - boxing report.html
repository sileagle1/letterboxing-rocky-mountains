some wonderful boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Box Canyon - Such a beautiful location. Safe and dry.<br/>
<br/>
Wandering Aengus - Possibly the most beautiful box I've found to <br/>
date. Box, stamp, book, clues...the whole deal. <br/>
<br/>
Andrews Lake - Had a hard time finding it, but finally grabbed it. A <br/>
bit wet, but safe.<br/>
<br/>
Engineer Mountain - If you are ever in Durango, don't let the time <br/>
involved in this one keep you from it. All I can say about this hike <br/>
is.. wow! The wildflowers are beyond anything I've ever seen.. and <br/>
I've lived here many years.  We saw a mountain goat, too! <br/>
<br/>
The Three Keys - Safe and sound and way fun. My brain hurts. <g><br/>
<br/>
Animas Overlook - Safe and dry and in a spectacular location.<br/>
<br/>
Campus in the Sky - Safe and dry and lots of fun.<br/>
<br/>
To Hell You Ride - We're 99.9% sure we were in the right place, but <br/>
were unable to find it. :(  <br/>
<br/>
We also found one that we can't discuss on the internet that was <br/>
really fun...and another that you have to discover for yourselves!<br/>
<br/>
It was a great trip. I just want to add a note about how much we <br/>
enjoyed y-nought's boxes. So much time and thought..and great riddles <br/>
and clues! <br/>
<br/>
Esmerelda, unpacking from a great trip<br/>
