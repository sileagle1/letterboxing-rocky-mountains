                    <div class="plaintext-content"> Hi all and a special welcome to Jodie--<br>
     I just got off the phone with an Open Spaceman. He called me in <br>
Durango from his cellphone as he was searching for the Onion <br>
Letterbox. After I clarified the clues he walked over to it and <br>
basically told me over the phone that it was approved. Before he <br>
found the exact location he was concerned about keeping people away <br>
from a gully that was prone to erosion. <br>
<br>
     I just wanted to pass this on and say that these folks were <br>
great to deal with from beginning to end. Since I don't live up there <br>
I won't be part of an ongoing arrangement of approval, but I am <br>
optimistic that some of the ideas discussed here would be well <br>
recieved by JeffCo. As always we need to do our part to make sure our <br>
boxes don't inadvertently harm these areas. When they see this is the <br>
case I think approval will be quick and painless.<br>

P.S. I've had those letterboxes of Jodies on my wish list for a <br>
while. Can't wait to check them out.<br>
