WY since it was confirmed as found on 9/11.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was a nifty hiding spot, but hey....it's kind of an urban <br/>
location and gardeners, at least, hate me.  Should you find yourself <br/>
up that way be aware of this news....look extra carefully, and please <br/>
let me know what you find out?<br/>
<br/>
pre<br/>
<br/>
..sighing heavily and thinking about a drive north to go czech it <br/>
out/PRE replace this box with at least a few out-of-area stamps that <br/>
were in it.  I know at least 2 other placers are annoyed at this park <br/>
area for possibly the same reason.<br/>
