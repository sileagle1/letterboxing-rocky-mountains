                    <div class="plaintext-content">We were devastated as well to learn from our Pirate Queen about the <br/>
condition of her first box in her well LOVED WOM series!  For any <br/>
boxer not to care for the journal like a RARE BOOK, which it IS, is <br/>
heartbreaking!!!  That's what this is all about afterall! <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to bring to the board another incident that concerns journal <br/>
care.  We were told that our Moffat Road journal was, well, misused, <br/>
to say the least!  It seems that a family found the box and allowed <br/>
for one of the children to use the stamp in the box to stamp nearly <br/>
every page of the journal!!!  Now, if we wanted that stamp on each <br/>
page, rather than the finders stamps, we would have done that <br/>
ourselves!  What makes it even more difficult is that this box is NOT <br/>
NEARBY and we don't know when we can get up there to replace the <br/>
journal.  <br/>
<br/>
PLEASE, families, teach your children to CARE about the boxes they <br/>
find and DON'T allow them to trash the journals that are made to <br/>
record the finders of the box.  This isn't the first time we've <br/>
encountered this situation.  We've seen journals where kids scribbled <br/>
on multiple pages.  I'm just askin' to TEACH YOUR CHILDREN TO CARE <br/>
AND RESPECT other people's property.  It's just the RIGHT thing to do!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening!  And HUGS to ES who plays down a devastating, <br/>
unnecessary loss!  It isn't just items in a box, it's a WELL LOVED <br/>
and RARE book that is now LOST to letterboxing history!!!<br/>

I'm a psycho about the stamping in and make sure that I explain to the kids, pretty much every time, that they need to stamp carefully and only use the space that their stamp needs!  <br/>

  Dixie, I will try to put getting up there on my list.  Can I put a new journal together (Do you have anything specific that you would like?) or do you want to send me a new one?  I don't when I could get there, but I am definetly closer than you are!<br/>

box stamp, because they don't have their own.  Journals get exposed to<br/>
rain and then are stuffed back into their Ziplock bags and left to mold,<br/>

journals, but there are also irresponsible adults with no children in tow<br/>

letterboxing and the ease of access to clues imperils the hobby.<br/>

One journal tip from us:  We save the little desiccant cylinders from<br/>
vitamin bottles and add one to each of our journal bags.  Of course, it<br/>
will not help for any severe problems.<br/>

If you do get a chance, anything simple would work.  I doubt I'll <br/>
have time to make a new one anytime real soon.  We do want to try to <br/>
get up there this season, just don't know when yet.  Keep in touch, <br/>
and I will let you know if/when we get a chance to get up there <br/>
ourselves.  Thanks, Aljan!  You're the best!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree, the folks that care to be on this board are unlikely to be the<br/>
source of these etiquette problems, but this is a place to share and<br/>
sometimes vent our frustrations.<br/>
<br/>
There is a learning curve for new boxers.  Common sense etiquette comes<br/>
naturally for some folks and others seem completely clueless.  Some folks<br/>
will read through the code of conduct on the websites and some just<br/>
breeze by, grab some clues, and start on their merry way.  When I noticed<br/>
a letterboxing workshop to be scheduled for the summer reading program in<br/>
Estes Park this year, I inquired about who was leading it.  I spoke with<br/>
that person (the children's librarian, who had recently taken up<br/>
letterboxing with her family) and asked if they'd be discussing<br/>
letterboxing etiquette, etc.  In short, we ended up having a nice chat<br/>
and were asked to come talk about etiquette and our own personal<br/>
experiences.  The librarians did a great job and included a "Code of<br/>
Conduct" in their packet of information.  Our participation enabled us to<br/>
share about some of the problems that esp. come up on the Front Range<br/>
with rehiding and journal care, etc., share with them about how much time<br/>
and care goes into making and placing these boxes, show them our journal<br/>
and an example of a finished journal from Nimbus' Blue Box.  I expect<br/>
that the eight or so families that attended will not be adding to any<br/>
frustrations in our wonderful Colorado letterboxing community.<br/>
