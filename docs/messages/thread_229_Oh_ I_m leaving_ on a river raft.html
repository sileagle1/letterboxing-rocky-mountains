Colorado-types or tick you off-hopefully the former :)<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to let you know I won't be accessible until after the <br/>
24th.  I have the fun opportunity of going on a eight day rafting <br/>
trip down the Middle Fork of the Salmon.  I am beyond excited to say <br/>
the least.  I have wanted to do something like this forever.  <br/>
Hopefully I will have time to carve a stamp tomorrow to plant a box.  <br/>
<br/>
The reason I am posting this is to let you all know that if anyone <br/>
needs to reach me, I'm going to change my status to no email during <br/>
my trip.  You will have to email directly and even then, it will have <br/>
to wait for a response.  I don't think there will be many computers <br/>
out there considering cars can't get where we are going! :))) I will <br/>
try to check my mail tonight before I go though.<br/>
<br/>
On a fun note, at our local Sportsman's Warehouse store today, I <br/>
noticed a whole section of "A Letterboxer's Companion!"  I was <br/>
shocked! Maybe someone will pick it up and get into it and then I <br/>
will have some boxes to find!<br/>
<br/>
toodles!<br/>
