Check back through the messages on this list to early 2005. Ramdelt<br/>
was contacted by a reporter and we had a pretty good discussion about it. <br/>

  It was kinda fun.  I just answered his questions honestly and tried really hard to relay to people how important the boxes are to the people that place them and how it will be really bad for people that steal/damage them in the future.<br/>

<br/>
I always think of it as the "left shoe syndrome".....One thang ya'll <br/>
prolly don't know about me: I HATE the L word - that thing you have to <br/>
do about once a week that involves washing clothes....so I'm gonna <br/>
include the "missing (left) sock syndrome, along with the "curse" in <br/>
my comments...now that I've rec'd the specific Qs...(a few are below)<br/>
<br/>
Missing a sock in the dryer....has a LONG and well-documented history <br/>
ALL its own, eh?<br/>
<br/>
I shall attempt working in the answers together with humor/puns IF I <br/>
can manage it! ;-<br/>
<br/>
Btw, if you EVER mention the "L word" all spelled out ANYWHERE I will <br/>
send the "curse" your way! ....<br/>
<br/>
"In your opinion, what's the best part about the hobby? What about <br/>
worst,if there is anything?<br/>
<br/>
Any other anecdotes or stories you would like to tell?"<br/>
<br/>
Well YES...but I ain't telling a reporter! <gasp><br/>
<br/>
pre <br/>
<br/>
(i)who'll report back if/when I hear more on this piece. (/i)<br/>
