Oh I know that one!!1 It's aka "what it sounds like at pre's house I <br/>
type "snort ."  <br/>
<br/>
"Lol" is just so boring, and not even close to descriptive enough, so <br/>
I trademarked it.  At the encouragement of several of my LTC <br/>
(Letterboxer Trading Cards) buddies I have been encouraged to make a <br/>
snort  LTC.  No promises on WHEN, but it will come to be....<br/>
<br/>
I must have sat on the north side of the Dewey Bridge stamping into <br/>
to Es's Westerns box for at least half and hour on my 2006 BMAO trip <br/>
to Moab just feeling really, really happy and glad to be alive.  <br/>
Those are the warm happy memories I will save in my mind when <br/>
thinking about Dewey Bridge, Moab and one of the most beautiful <br/>
stretchs of countryside in the entire country...<br/>

will help keep it alive around here.  If only the tailings pile could disappear that quickly!!! <br/>
