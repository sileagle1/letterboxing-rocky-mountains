It sounds like the space that Tai Chi and Chai Tea are offering is going to work great. We will move into date negotiation, and I'll post more info as I get it.<br>

I still have a few spots open for my workshop this sat. I would love to see more of you!<br>
<br>
We'll be making letterbox pouches, and a logbook, and discussing everything there is to discuss about transferring images, carving, embellishing your logbooks, etc etc! Space is limited, so please sign up here:<br>
<br>

There is a materials list but nothing complicated. I can even get it to you Saturday morning if need be.<br>

A special thank you to our newbies who had the courage to come down out of the rafters and say hi. It can be scary to meet an established group of people, but it's always nice to see some new faces! New faces mean new boxes! <br>
<br>
TC and CH - the space was AMAZING! Really cool. And the cookies were fantastic!<br>

For those of you who missed it, or couldn't come, I'll see about doing another one in a couple of months. <br>

The workshop was AWESOME! I am psyched now to get my boxes out there with beautiful handmade logs! No more excuses. Well... I'm sure that I will still manage to come up with some. RavenWolf, my dear, thank you! So generous with your many talents.<br>
<br>
Logs to makeand new transfer and carving techniques to try out. Better get busy.<br>
<br>
And I send a big shout out to our newbies, and not so newbies whose faces I haven't seen in a while or didn't remember that I have seen before! It will be merry meet again next time. :) It was really fun to see some new faces! Welcome you, your new talents and enthusiasm to our group!<br>
