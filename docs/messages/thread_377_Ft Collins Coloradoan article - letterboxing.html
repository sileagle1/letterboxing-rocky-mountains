GETTING A CLUE: Hanna Wilder, 6, of Fort Collins, looks for stamps while flipping through a small notebook that is kept in a letterbox and hidden by a tree near Spring Creek in southwest Fort Collins. Wilder, her family, and others from Fort Collins hide boxes then give clues for others to hike to find them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rich Abrahamson/The Coloradoan <br/>
TOOLS OF THE TRADE: Contents of the 'Blue Suede Shoes' letterbox include a notebook, stamp and ink<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How to play <br/>
<br/>
Someone hides a waterproof box containing at least a logbook and carved rubber stamp and possibly other goodies. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The hider gives clues as to how to locate the box. These can be straightforward, cryptic or somewhere in between. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hunters find the clues, usually by logging on to www.letterboxing.org <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hunters use the clues to find the box then stamps the logbook in the box with their personal stamp and their personal logbook with the box's stamp to verify that they found the box. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game over or move on to the next box. <br/>
Letterboxing by the numbers <br/>
8 -- Number of letterboxes hidden in and around Fort Collins. <br/>
50 -- Number of states in which letterboxes appear. <br/>
140 -- Number of letterboxes in Colorado. <br/>
2,105 -- Number of letterboxes in letterboxing-crazy Connecticut and the most per capita in the country. <br/>
11,485 -- Number of letterboxes in the United States. <br/>
American chronology of letterboxing <br/>
1989 -- The Valley Quest Program in New Hampshire and Vermont said to have placed the first letterboxes. <br/>
1997 -- Oldest found letterboxes from Valley Quest. <br/>
1998 -- Smithsonian Magazine runs article on letterboxing in Dartmoor, England, the home of letterboxing. The article fueled the current letterboxing movement with the first post-Smithsonian boxes placed in Vermont, Tennessee and Oregon. <br/>
2004 -- More than 11,000 letterboxes hidden <br/>
FAQs <br/>
Question: What do I need to play? <br/>
Answer: At the very minimum, you will need the clues. You should also have a personal stamp, inkpad, personal logbook and a pencil (for writing in the box's logbook, if you want). Depending on the clue, you may also need a compass, map or other tools. <br/>
Q: What's the deal with the personal stamp? <br/>
A: The personal stamp is your personal mark that you leave in the logbook of each box you find. It is a rubber stamp that you either carve yourself or have custom made. Creating your personal stamp is part of the art. It's your signature in the letterboxing world. <br/>
Q: What is a pace? <br/>
A: Many clues will have pace counting involved. A pace is one step. <br/>
Q: How do I publish or distribute clues? <br/>
A: Create your own Web site and add a link to your clues to wwwletterboxing.org clue database, or enter your clues directly in the database. <br/>
Q: How does geocaching differ from letterboxing? <br/>
A: They have many elements in common, the most important of which is solving problems in beautiful locations. Geocaching clues will almost always feature the use of a GPS in the hunt. In letterboxing, you take a stamp image and leave a stamp image while in geocaching you take an object and leave an object. <br/>
Letterboxing etiquette <br/>
There are no rules to letterboxing, just common sense etiquette. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Respect the land when hunting boxes and when hiding them. If placed on private land, make sure to get landowner permission. On public land, check with the land manager to make sure it's OK to place a box. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't publish or re-transmit other peoples' clues or stamp images without their permission. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Repack and hide the box as well or better than when you found it, in the exact place you found it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After finding the box, try to be discreet when stamping and re-hiding it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do not post clue solutions online or discuss how to solve clues in a public forum. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Stamp -- This can depict whatever you deem to be appropriate for the letterbox. Usually, it will relate in some manner to the location in which it is placed; other stamps may commemorate a person or an event. Stamps can be commercially made or hand made. Commercial stamps are of vulcanized red-rubber made from your artwork. Expect to pay in the range of $10 for a 2-inch x 3-inch stamp. Hand-made stamps are usually carved, either from carving medium, or from erasers. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Notebook -- This is the logbook that you leave in the letterbox for visitors to stamp. Get a good quality artist sketchbook, acid-free (not newsprint like) if you want them to last a lifetime. Size is important, as you don't want it too big for the container. Also, having lots of pages leaves lots of space for many visitors. Cost is $2 or less. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Container -- A waterproof cylindrical tube from a surplus supplier or Rubbermaid containers purchased at discount stores to stash the notebook, stamp and other goodies. Squeeze the container to make sure the seal is good. Expect to pay $1.50 to $2. Make a label for the cover with the letterbox name, how to contact you if it has been disrupted and a plea for the finder to respect its contents. <br/>
<br/>
First, there was treasure hunting. Then, there was geocaching. And now, there is letterboxing, which is geocaching with an imprisoned Martha Stewart twist. <br/>
While treasure hunting has gone the way of marbles, geocaching has gone the way of the X-Box with more than a half million people playing treasure hunting with global positioning system (GPS) units. More than 121,000 caches, which are breadbox size containers holding mostly worthless items, are hidden in more than 200 countries. <br/>
Letterboxing, well, like geocaching in 2000, it's in its infancy. There are no numbers about participants and roughly 11,500 boxes are hidden in this country, including 140 and counting in Colorado and eight at last count in Larimer County. <br/>
"Not that many people know about letterboxing," said Lin Wilder, who with her 6-year-old daughter Hanna are two of the few who play in Fort Collins. "But if you look at Web sites, there are more and more boxes being placed all the time. It's one of those things that right now is small, but I hope it Treasure hunting, geocaching and letterboxing have many things in common. The treasures are found mostly in public places such as parks, open spaces and national forests. <br/>
Junk, such as key chains and McDonald's Happy Meal toys, are hidden in containers, clues are given to help seekers find the stashes, and then you profess your sleuth skills by recording in the container's logbook that you were here. <br/>
Stamps and clues <br/>
The Martha twist in letterboxing lies in its creativeness, and we're not talking using a GPS. <br/>
The stamp is to letterboxing what the GPS is to geocaching. In geocaching, you go online to find clues and coordinates of caches then use your GPS to sniff out the booty. You might pluck a magnet from the container and toss in a Matchbox car. <br/>
In letterboxing, there are no waypoints, usually only directions, straightforward or cryptic, maybe some map coordinates or compass bearings from prominent landmarks to assist you. But once you find the treasure, the finder of a letterbox uses a stamp in the container to stamp their own logbook and then uses a personalized, usually hand-crafted, stamp to record in the logbook that they were there. Hand-made stamps usually are carved either from a special carving material or erasers and often depict something dear to the person. <br/>
"One of the draws of letterboxing is you don't have all the technical stuff you do with geocaching and another is there is an artistic component to letterboxing because most people, especially kids love to make their own stamps," said Wilder, who has hidden three letterboxes in Fort Collins. "Hanna and I enjoy hiking and walking and this adds some adventure to getting to the destination." <br/>
Jodie Kern, a 28-year-old 911 dispatcher for the Grand County Sheriff's Department who lives in Grand Lake, said she started letterboxing 1 1/2 years ago and has been hooked ever since. Not only does she seek letterboxes, she has hidden five around the state. She grew up enjoying the outdoors, especially hiking, horseback riding, canoeing and kayaking. She, too, believes the stamps add an element of intrigue to the game. <br/>
"I love the idea of the mixture of treasure hunting, art, adventure and communicating with other people," said Kern, whose two young children and husband often join her on the hunts. "It is really thrilling for me to be out hunting, finding a box and seeing the stamps of other people." <br/>
Wilder said hiding a letterbox is as fun as looking for one. Clues often play off local landmarks, such as streets, trails, parks, buildings and mountains. <br/>
An excuse to venture outdoors <br/>
Kern said letterboxing has led her family to places that they might not otherwise venture. The first letterbox the family found was at picturesque Hanging Lake in Glenwood Canyon. It left an impression on the family. <br/>
"After what seemed like going straight up the trail to heaven, we were amazed by the beauty of Hanging Lake and the rare yellow columbines that grow there," Kern said. "We got chattered at by the jays that were quite put out by our presence. And the stamp, it was beautiful." <br/>
Letterboxes in the Fort Collins area require little hiking and little deciphering. The farthest one is about a mile hike in Horsetooth Mountain Park. Others can be found around the Colorado State University campus, the Anheuser Busch Brewery, Lee Martinez Park and along the city bike trail. <br/>
