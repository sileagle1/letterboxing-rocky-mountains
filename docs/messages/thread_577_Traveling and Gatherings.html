When that happens I will try like heck to make it up there. There are <br/>
a lot of folks coming to Moab, but I know of quite a few from the <br/>
Front Range area who can't make it and I'd like to meet them too. <br/>
Frankly, I'm in awe thinking of how the Moab meet has blossomed. <br/>
Hopefully, the same sort of thing can happen at other places along <br/>
the Rockies.<br/>
