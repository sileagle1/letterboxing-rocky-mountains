&gt; New letterbox: Alchemist's Lizard<br/>
&gt; Littleton, Arapahoe County, CO<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Easy hike - about 1.5 miles both ways, no real elevation change to speak<br/>
of. It should take you between 35 and 45 minutes from start to finish<br/>
depending on how fast you walk. The path is dog friendly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From I-70, or I-25 take C-470 to the SantaFe exit. Go North on Santa Fe<br/>
to Mineral (about 2 miles). Head West (Left) onto Mineral, then go right at<br/>
the 1st stop light. Go past the RTD parking to the 1st real road and turn<br/>
left. This should lead you to the South Platte Nature Center - Park here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you have time, check out the nature center. It tells you about the<br/>
wildlife you might encounter, and about the general area you'll be walking<br/>
in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Go down to the paved path just behind the nature center. Head north along<br/>
the path. Walk for about 5-10 minutes and on your left hand side you should<br/>
see a fence with a small gap. In the gap there is a pole proclaiming that<br/>
only hikers and people with dogs are allowed to pass - no horses or<br/>
bicycles. Head through the fence, past the pole onto the dirt path.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At the first fork, head left to the brown arrow. (Your bearing should be<br/>
around 330.) Follow along the path past the second arrow toward the river.<br/>
The path parallels the river for a bit, then curves to the right and then<br/>
back to the left. As the path curves to the left, you should come out of<br/>
some trees into a more open area. Take note of the large tree at about 60<br/>
degrees 50-60 paces up the trail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The right portion of this tree has been broken, probably as a result of<br/>
the large snowfall Colorado had this spring. On the broken portion of the<br/>
tree, there are a few steps left behind from a tree house that children once<br/>
occupied.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Go under the broken 'archway' of the tree and set your compass to 110. You<br/>
should see the reminants of a dead tree. You're going to need to do a small<br/>
amount of bushwacking here. Head along bearing 110, 35 paces to the base of<br/>
the tree. Then turn to a bearing of 190 and head another 15 paces. In front<br/>
of you should be another dead tree that looks as though it has been bent in<br/>
half. The legend of the Alchemist's Lizard is hidden underneath.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please rehide well and take extra caution in retreiving and rehiding this<br/>
box. The platte river trail is frequented by MANY people especially in the<br/>
summer months.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After you are done stamping in, you can head back the way you came, or you<br/>
can continue a little further up the path. Past a small bridge and up some<br/>
stairs is a fork in the road, head right (120 degrees). Continue down the<br/>
path to the next fork and head left. Head through the fence and over another<br/>
wooden bridge and this will put you back onto the paved path. This little<br/>
detour should only take you another 5 minutes or so. Head south along the<br/>
paved path to get back to your car, or continue north along the river if you<br/>
would like to walk a bit further.<br/>
