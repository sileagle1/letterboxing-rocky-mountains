New to the area, new to the hobby, it doesn't matter.  We want to meet YOU!!!  Inspired by the gracious Puppy Luv, who hosted a Summer Bash geared toward some "newbies" in her area, this event is geared not only to newbies, but to oldies who have transplanted themselves to our fair state. <br/>
<br/>Come, meet, exchange, trade stories, stamps, and create community!<br/><br/>We'll be meeting at our "old standby" the REI Flagship store in downtown Denver.  There's a Starbucks inside that is a great place to gather, and several parks with letterboxes just a short walk away.  Let's meet, grab a coffee, swap stamps, and get to know one another (or see friends we just dont see often enough!).  <br/>
<br/>Event stamps are in the works ... and maybe even some fun surprises.  Stay tuned!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=2953" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=2953</a></div>
