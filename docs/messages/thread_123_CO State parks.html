I also wrote to the state parks system back in May.  While they <br>
weren't opposed, I never heard back with a difinitive answer.  <br>
I think we're okay - so long as we don't require boxers to go <br>
bushwhacking to find our boxes.<br>
<br>
I have two boxes planted in Chatfield State Park, and there is one in <br>
Roxborough.  So .... I think we're okay for now!<br>

Here's the email I received:<br>

Thank you for writing, Kat and Eric.<br>
I learn something new almost every day answering e-mails, and today <br>
is no exception.  The term Letterboxing will now be a part of my <br>
knowledge base right next to Geocaching. <br>
		<br>
At this time, Colorado State Parks doesn't have an official position <br>
of which I am aware for these two hobbies.  Our utmost concerns are <br>
always the protection of the Natural Resources in our care and the <br>
safety of our customers and employees.  At this time I would suggest <br>
you contact the Park Manager of the individual parks you are <br>
interested in visiting to see if your hobby would work in their <br>
facility.  <br>
		<br>
I am forwarding your e-mail to our management team for their <br>
consideration toward establishing a specific policy on this <br>
activity.  I would be happy to keep you abreast of any updates. <br>
