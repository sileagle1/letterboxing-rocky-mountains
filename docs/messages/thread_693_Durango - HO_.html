In Durango I highly recommend 'Campus in the Sky'...you have to <br/>
solve clues (not as hard as the onion) and it's so fun when you see <br/>
the really clever places y-nought has stashed stuff. :)  But it's <br/>
not so difficult that it will take you an entire day. <br/>
<br/>
I'd also suggest a run up to Animas Overlook.. the view from there <br/>
is splendiferous, it's not extremely difficult to get to, and you <br/>
can do a series of boxes all by different boxers.  Y-nought's <br/>
new 'Celtic Tree' box is on the way up, too.  I haven't made it to <br/>
that box yet, but I'm confident it's worth the stop. <br/>
<br/>
Rio-Grande is pretty much a drive by, so an easy one if you're in <br/>
the area near it. <br/>
<br/>
Are you driving over the pass into Ouray?  What a drive! I love it!  <br/>
Engineer Mountain is a fabulous hike, but it does take some time.  <br/>
The trail is just breathtaking and well worth it if you have the <br/>
time.  Along that road is 'Wandering Aengus' which you can do easily <br/>
and in a short time.. I love that one.  Further along is 'Wings of <br/>
Eagles'.. right on the top of the pass and not terribly far from the <br/>
road.  Down the mountain and into Ouray.. several boxes there but <br/>
I've only been to the 'Box Canyon' box which is easy to get to and <br/>
find.  <br/>
<br/>
Are you just zooming through Grand Junction or will you have any <br/>
boxing time?  They have good pie here.  Mmmmm... pie.<br/>
<br/>

I would be very psyched to have lunch or dinner with your clan. You <br/>
just name the time and day and I'll make my schedule work. (They do <br/>
have picnic tables at the Animas Overlook loop, it might be cooler up <br/>
there if this heat wave continues). But anywhere is fine for me.<br/>
<br/>
I checked on Celtic Tree today because I heard they had to bring in <br/>
some equipment to save some trailers from the flooding on Junction <br/>
Creek. Happily, it's high and dry, although  I did have to wade <br/>
through some refreshingly frigid water to get to it.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of my favorite boxes on your route that Esmerelda <br/>
didn't mention:<br/>
<br/>
There is one in Del Norte and one by Wolf Creek Pass that are <br/>
driveby's.<br/>
<br/>
There is a rather long but flattish hike to a Drewclan box near <br/>
Pagosa Springs. Those waterfalls are probably thundering now. Bigtime.<br/>
<br/>
Between Delta and Grand Junction is a cool letterbox in Escalante <br/>
Canyon by Esmerelda.<br/>
<br/>
And then Big Fish in Grand Junction is one of my alltime favorites. I <br/>
haven't found There Were These Two Guys.... yet, but I want to, <br/>
baaaad.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, back to doing my little happy dance.<br/>

Y - I'll email you off list and we can see about working something <br/>
out. We would love to at least stop and say hello, and - hey, <br/>
everyone has to eat! I also have a few boxes that I may not have <br/>
time to plant that I can leave in your capable hands.<br/>
<br/>
Es - there may just be some pie time in GJ... You gonna be around <br/>
the 9th of June? Maybe the morning of the 10th? =3 =3 I'll have to <br/>
talk with all of my traveling buddies!<br/>
<br/>
There are always so many fun boxes to pursue, and never enough time! <br/>
Thank you for all the recommendations. We are definately gonna hit <br/>
Animas Overlook, and I want '3 Keys', 'Campus in the sky' and '2 <br/>
Guys'! We'll have to see what we get to!<br/>
<br/>
I would love to get the one from the Drew Clan in Pagosa, but we <br/>
just aren't going to be there long enough to do that one. Mesa Verde <br/>
becons! Pagosa is little more than an overnighter, and a pool stop!<br/>

As a matter of coincidence there will be a 50 year anniversary party <br/>
for the National Forest Service at Campus in the Sky that weekend. <br/>
The 'boxing should be unaffected, but there will be a hot air ballon, <br/>
reptile exhibit, mule team, dog demonstration etc.... all for free. I <br/>
just didn't want you to think we do that all the time up there.<br/>
<br/>
And WOOT! It sounds like a certain Pirate will be settin' sail that <br/>
week too. I'll bet there'll be plunder for the adventurous when she is <br/>
through.....but I wonder where?<br/>
