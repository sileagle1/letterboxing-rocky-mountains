  So I hear. I think I remember reading one of Randy's posts where he <br/>
  said some of his "boxes" had no stamps, but were only verification <br/>
  that you had solved the clues. I'm thinking that might be why it is <br/>
  listed as "no box". And with those clues it would make sense. Nobody <br/>
  is going to fill up their logbook with stamps from Randy Hall mystery <br/>
  boxes.<br/>

  &gt; I emailed Randy once about it and he had thought that no one had <br/>
  found it.<br/>
  &gt; But I didnt ask him about number of boxes.  You could email him <br/>
  about.<br/>
  &gt; He wont give ANY clues tho.<br/>

    Although we don't have anywhere near the quantity of boxes that <br/>
they have in other parts of the country, we are blessed with high <br/>
quality of clues and boxes that are here. I would trade a hundred <br/>
stamps for the image from a Bard's Tale.<br/>
   I have toyed with the idea of a trip to Nevada to get a stamp from <br/>
the legendary Mapsurfer. As with Silver Eagle's Moose, I am green <br/>
with envy that you have been boxing with him. <br/>
