little number came up in the Eurovision Song Contest tonight, I<br>
couldn't help but think of you. This contest is a riot each year.  I<br>
think that those on the continent take it a bit more seriously than<br>
the Brits do (We all watch to make fun of it), but it's fun to see. <br>
Not all the numbers are this over the top--some are stranger by far.<br>
