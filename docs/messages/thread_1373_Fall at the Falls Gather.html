Many thanks to Dragonrider for hosting this most excellent gathering in<br>
Twin Falls ID yesterday!  We had a blast!  Great friends (old and new),<br>
great food, great boxes!  Cooties swarming in spite of the Cootie<br>
Inoculation stickers.  Lots of really good ideas I'm going to be<br>
copying.  I especially enjoyed the Creatures of the Canyon series and am<br>
proud to say I have the complete set.  (Had to do more than one<br>
dog-and-pony show to distract the lookers-on, but we got that Trout!)<br>
<br>
DR, thanks for procuring the COVERED AREA, even it you had to show up at<br>
6:00 a.m. to get it. 8~D  It was a toasty day, even in the shade!<br>
<br>
There was an unscheduled event some of us got to see later after dinner<br>
in town:  a base jumper off that MAGNIFICENT bridge being filmed for a<br>
National Geographic special.  The cameraman was MOST patient with<br>
A-Bear's questions while we waited for the sun and clouds to get just<br>
right!  He did pack up rather quickly though.<br>
<br>
I arrived home just before midnight - only 2 hours late - tired, but<br>
happy in the glow of the day and finally rehydrated.  So grand to see<br>
all you super 'boxers!  Check out the photos on the AQ event page.  I'll<br>
be adding mine directly.<br>
