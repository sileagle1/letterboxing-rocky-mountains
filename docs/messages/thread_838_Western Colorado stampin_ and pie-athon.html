Before we start posting numbers, we need to know what time the people <br>
who come for Sunday will arrive in town (or at least plan to arrive in <br>
town).  Then we can get a schedule down and be ready to rumble!  <br>

I'm about to get light headed from the thought of all the new <br>
letterboxes. :::fans self:::  I have had notes from 4 carvers from out <br>

<br>
Been talking to Es. I am one of the lucky ones who can come for both<br>
days. Hopefully can arrive by Friday night, but may have to be<br>
Saturday noon. I'll be driving home to UT from visiting family in OK<br>
and can hit GJ on the way. Coincidently, I will be in GJ early this<br>
next week and plan to hide a couple of new boxes then. Better get to<br>
carving.<br>
<br>
Excited to share pie with new/old friends in GJ,<br>
