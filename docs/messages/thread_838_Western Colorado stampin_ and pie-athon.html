town).  Then we can get a schedule down and be ready to rumble!  <br/>

Been talking to Es. I am one of the lucky ones who can come for both<br/>
days. Hopefully can arrive by Friday night, but may have to be<br/>
Saturday noon. I'll be driving home to UT from visiting family in OK<br/>
and can hit GJ on the way. Coincidently, I will be in GJ early this<br/>
next week and plan to hide a couple of new boxes then. Better get to<br/>
carving.<br/>
<br/>
Excited to share pie with new/old friends in GJ,<br/>
