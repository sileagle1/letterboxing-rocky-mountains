Symbols of Colorado #1: Greenback Cutthroat Trout. This is the state <br/>
fish of Colorado. Greenbacks originally lived in the mountain and <br/>
foothill areas of the Arkansas and South Platte river systems in <br/>
Colorado and part of Wyoming. Today, they exist in only about 5 <br/>
percent of their original range and are listed as a threatened <br/>
species. Thanks to preservation programs, Greenbacks are on their <br/>
way to recovery.<br/>
<br/>
Terrain: Easy. About a mile to the box over mostly level paths, but <br/>
plan to spend some time driving there.<br/>
Clues: Easy<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Reach Rampart Reservoir from Rampart Range Road. This <br/>
can be accessed from Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs, from Mt <br/>
Herman Road out of Monument, or Rt 22 out of Woodland Park. See <br/>
notes on driving to the trailhead. Find the Rainbow Gulch Trailhead <br/>
about a mile and a half north of road 306, or about two and a half <br/>
miles south of Loy Creek Road.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: Follow the trail to the reservoir. Left where the path forks <br/>
at the diversion dam. Left at the bridge. 65p past the bridge, sight <br/>
a boulder at 120*. In a crack on the creek side, under a piece of <br/>
granite, you might find a fish out of water.<br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
- No inkpad or pencil in the box, make sure you bring your own.<br/>
- Rampart Range Road is a primary gravel road. It has some steep <br/>
elevation changes and hairpin switchbacks with no guardrails. The <br/>
views are breathtaking, but I recommend a 4 wheel drive vehicle. We <br/>
arrived at the trailhead from Garden of the Gods, and it took about <br/>
an hour and a half. We returned via Mt Herman Road into Monument. Mt <br/>
Herman Road is more shaded from the sun and may be more snow-packed <br/>
and slippery than if approaching from the south.<br/>
- This is at fairly high altitude, come prepared for sudden <br/>
temperature and weather changes.<br/>
