                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think it would be interesting to take a poll to see which boxes in <br>
the Front Range area most of us have already found, or want to go <br>
find.<br>
<br>
Then - perhaps we could schedule a gathering that would involve <br>
hunting for a "box less traveled"?  <br>
<br>
We could picnic, meet one another, and hike together to find a box!<br>
<br>
What do you all think?<br>
I can set up a poll to see which boxes we'd like to try for.<br>
