Awe, I've been away from a computer for a couple of days, and now I feel <br/>
complete again after a great chuckle reading your posts! Thanks for the fun! I <br/>
feel like I'm home again. I'll be home again tomorrow. I hoped to do a little <br/>
boxing here at Lake Tahoe, but the snow is higher than an SUV, so maybe <br/>
not! But there's one out in Nevada near the highway that I haved found yet, so <br/>
maybe tomorrow. This trip has been a fun one, the temperature was about 80 <br/>
in Carmel, so we had some fun beach time, and found a couple of fun boxes <br/>
up  on one of the higher peaks above town. Haven't heard from any pierates <br/>
about finding my missing box, so I made a new one and hid it up higher this <br/>
time!<br/>
