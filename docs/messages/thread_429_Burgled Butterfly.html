Hi folks, just wanted to let you know I checked on Symbols of <br/>
Colorado #2: Hairstreak Butterfly yesterday, and it is gone.  We <br/>
looked around the area to see if it had been misplaced or <br/>
vandalized, but there was no trace of it, it has clearly been <br/>
stolen.  I don't plan on replacing it.  The other letterbox in that <br/>
park, Maggie, is still there, so it looks like an accidental find-n-<br/>
filch and not a targeted seek-n-steal (I hope).<br/>

Thanks all for your kind words about the missing butterfly.  This is <br/>
my 6th to 8th box that has gone missing (not sure about a couple of <br/>
them since they were in other states).  One may have been trashed by <br/>
a construction crew, one appears to have been buried under a <br/>
decaying tree, one grew permanently into the root ball of a scrub <br/>
tree that popped up out of nowhere, one appears to have been dragged <br/>
over the edge of a cliff by some rodent.  But at least four of these <br/>
appear to have been deliberately stolen.<br/>
<br/>
Every time one of these happens, I ask myself, who would take that?  <br/>
There's nothing of value in there, the stamp and log book couldn't <br/>
possibly be considered "cool" by teenage stoners stumbling upon the <br/>
spot... I mean, I'd expect kids to vandalize it more than out and <br/>
out steal it...  I just don't get it.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, I have come to accept the fact that letterboxes do not <br/>
have permanence.  That's one of the reasons I don't replace my <br/>
missing boxes, I view them as sort of temporary art that only a few <br/>
people will get to appreciate before they disappear.  I think that <br/>
in a way that makes it a little more special to the people who have <br/>
that stamp in their log book.  So, get 'em while they last, folks...<br/>
