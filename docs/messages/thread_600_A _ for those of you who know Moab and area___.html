There are endless hiding places in Moab. Check out the area while <br>
you are here and see if anything calls out to you. Off-hand, I think <br>
the Moab Rim, Hunter Canyon, Corona & Bowtie Arches, right-hand Mill <br>
Creek Canyon, Slickrock Bike Trail, are all a few places that scream <br>
for boxes. The area is so huge that you could easily hide them on <br>
trails that already have boxes also. Negro Bill Canyon is long <br>
enough to support a series of boxes. The Portal Trail has 4 boxes on <br>
it, just to coax boxers to climb the whole thing! Hidden Valley has <br>
three boxes on it now, by three different placers! Awww, so many <br>
places, so little time!!!!<br>
<br>
By the way, everyone, check the new list, I planted a new box in <br>
Moab while the LB site was down a couple of days ago, yayyyy!!!!<br>

Maybe if I just totally strike out on finding a good spot I will entreat finding a hiding place for it with one of you that live in the area if you interested?  I will bring it all ready to plant.<br>

Kat is right, there is no way you could strike out on finding a good <br>
spot. If I were to narrow it down out of Kat's suggestions,  I would <br>
think the Moab Rim Trail was ripe for a couple of boxes. <br>
<br>
Yesss. Right across the River from the Portal boxes and on a trail <br>
that connects with Hidden Valley (eventually). It is kind of steep, <br>
though, and there are a few folks that DRIVE that trail. So you would <br>
want to keep the box away from the jeep tracks.<br>
<br>
There is a little pamphlet called "Moab Area Hiking Trails" that is <br>
free at the Moab Visitor Center at Main and Center Streets. That <br>
little list of trails might save a lot of time for hopeful planters.<br>
<br>
I'm lacing up my shoes now for the new one out Kane Creek. The last <br>
couple of sentences of those clues have my curiosity piqued, big time.<br>
<br>
Oh, man, I can't wait.<br>

y-nought.....liking the new trail name<br>
