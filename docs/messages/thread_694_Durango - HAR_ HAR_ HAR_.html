a trip report afterwards!<br/>
<br/>
At this point I'm planning on being on my own letterboxing Road Trip <br/>
that week and won't be in town.  I've been champing at the bit <br/>
waiting for a few good days off all squashed together so I could hit <br/>
the trail. <br/>
<br/>
But we'll have pie sometime down the road! Woot!<br/>

&gt; The plan is Pagosa Springs, Durango (2 days), Ouray (2 days), Grand <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's the how-many-hot-springs-can-we-hit-in-one-week vacation! =3<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Y - I'll email you off list and we can see about working something <br/>
&gt; out. We would love to at least stop and say hello, and - hey, <br/>
&gt; everyone has to eat! I also have a few boxes that I may not have <br/>
&gt; time to plant that I can leave in your capable hands.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Es - there may just be some pie time in GJ... You gonna be around <br/>
&gt; the 9th of June? Maybe the morning of the 10th? =3 =3 I'll have to <br/>
&gt; talk with all of my traveling buddies!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are always so many fun boxes to pursue, and never enough <br/>
time! <br/>
&gt; Thank you for all the recommendations. We are definately gonna hit <br/>
&gt; Animas Overlook, and I want '3 Keys', 'Campus in the sky' and '2 <br/>
&gt; Guys'! We'll have to see what we get to!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would love to get the one from the Drew Clan in Pagosa, but we <br/>
&gt; just aren't going to be there long enough to do that one. Mesa <br/>
Verde <br/>
&gt; becons! Pagosa is little more than an overnighter, and a pool stop!<br/>

&gt; &gt; What a wonderful trip and the perfect time of the year for it!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In Durango I highly recommend 'Campus in the Sky'...you have to <br/>
&gt; &gt; solve clues (not as hard as the onion) and it's so fun when you <br/>
&gt; see <br/>
&gt; &gt; the really clever places y-nought has stashed stuff. :)  But it's <br/>
&gt; &gt; not so difficult that it will take you an entire day. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'd also suggest a run up to Animas Overlook.. the view from <br/>
there <br/>
&gt; &gt; is splendiferous, it's not extremely difficult to get to, and you <br/>
&gt; &gt; can do a series of boxes all by different boxers.  Y-nought's <br/>
&gt; &gt; new 'Celtic Tree' box is on the way up, too.  I haven't made it <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; that box yet, but I'm confident it's worth the stop. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Rio-Grande is pretty much a drive by, so an easy one if you're in <br/>
&gt; &gt; the area near it. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Are you driving over the pass into Ouray?  What a drive! I love <br/>
&gt; it!  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Engineer Mountain is a fabulous hike, but it does take some <br/>
time.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; The trail is just breathtaking and well worth it if you have the <br/>
&gt; &gt; time.  Along that road is 'Wandering Aengus' which you can do <br/>
&gt; easily <br/>
&gt; &gt; and in a short time.. I love that one.  Further along is 'Wings <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; Eagles'.. right on the top of the pass and not terribly far from <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; road.  Down the mountain and into Ouray.. several boxes there but <br/>
&gt; &gt; I've only been to the 'Box Canyon' box which is easy to get to <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; find.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Are you just zooming through Grand Junction or will you have any <br/>
&gt; &gt; boxing time?  They have good pie here.  Mmmmm... pie.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Es, foofing up the valley for guests<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Soooooo Samurai and I, along with Brother Raven and clan are <br/>
&gt; gonna <br/>
&gt; &gt; be <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the Durango area June 5 and 6. We would love to catch a <br/>
lunch <br/>
&gt; &gt; or <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; dinner with folks in that area if at all possible! We also need <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; know the best boxes to catch. We are gonna be through Pagosa <br/>
&gt; &gt; Springs, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Durango, Ouray and Grand Junction before heading back to Denver!<br/>
