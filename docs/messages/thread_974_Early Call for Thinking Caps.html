We are just a few weeks away from the big treasure hunt here in <br/>
Durango. For those of you that weren't members last winter, this is <br/>
a week-long city-wide treasure hunt with five clues a day given out <br/>
over the radio. This is a great opportunity for me to win valuable <br/>
prizes and for you to feel smug and smart because y-nought could <br/>
never win without your help. And it's a fun way to pass a week in <br/>
mid-winter.<br/>
<br/>
Last year the clever tips from this group led me to actually grope <br/>
the porta-potty that the prize was hidden in...but alas, I didn't <br/>
climb up into the flower bed and pull it out of the vent chimney. I <br/>
will try to do better this year.<br/>

As you folks recall the clues were very obscure. I have posted a <br/>
file in the link section with the clues from last year and their <br/>
explanation of them is at the bottom. If you feel like having a <br/>
look, this may help to guess what they will be getting at this year.<br/>
<br/>
It all starts on January 30, (I know, a long way off yet, but what <br/>
can I say, I'm excited). I'll start posting clues as I hear them on <br/>
the radio. If this bothers anybody let me know offlist and I'll find <br/>
another way to beg for help.<br/>

I'm not so good with links, however.  Did you mean you'd put a link on <br/>

JeLyBean- I noticed you've been wearing that thinking cap a lot lately. <br/>
And I'm glad to see you planting more. There was a bighorn sheep <br/>
mystery box in Colorado that just recently dyed, so I'm glad to see ewe <br/>
keeping that thread alive. As far as the containers, I think there is a <br/>
sentence in Murphy's law that states, "useful and well designed <br/>
products will be discontinued as soon as possible." <br/>
<br/>
pre- That reeaaaaly long gangly link is just a "shortcut" to the file <br/>
called "Snowdown Silver Bullet Clues" on this here message group. A lot <br/>
of those clues require local knowledge, but some of the references have <br/>
to do with songs or movies or just finding weird similarities between <br/>
the various clues. As with letterboxing, a twisted mind helps.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yay!!!! Last year's hunt was so fun. Now I can just visualize Y <br/>
climbing up to the chimney of a porta-potty in his brown polyester <br/>
with maybe some kind of lighted, mirrored disco ball attached to the <br/>
back of his boxing pack! <br/>
<br/>
Y, after spending a day exploring down in Butler Wash through some <br/>
ruins, Kennamtn and I are just giddy over the thought of getting <br/>
back down there soon and climbing back up Comb Ridge for a little <br/>
treasure up there. We are plotting some boxes to hide along the Sand <br/>
Island area of the San Juan also. We stopped and visited with the <br/>
Navajo Code Talkers on the way home, so Kenna could add that awesome <br/>
stamp to the collection.<br/>
<br/>
Kat (who has been in a boxing drought of late but is snapping out of <br/>
it with the thought of carving, carving, carving!)<br/>

&gt; Hello -<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are just a few weeks away from the big treasure hunt here in <br/>
&gt; Durango. For those of you that weren't members last winter, this <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; a week-long city-wide treasure hunt with five clues a day given <br/>
out <br/>
&gt; over the radio. This is a great opportunity for me to win valuable <br/>
&gt; prizes and for you to feel smug and smart because y-nought could <br/>
&gt; never win without your help. And it's a fun way to pass a week in <br/>
&gt; mid-winter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last year the clever tips from this group led me to actually grope <br/>
&gt; the porta-potty that the prize was hidden in...but alas, I didn't <br/>
&gt; climb up into the flower bed and pull it out of the vent chimney. <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; will try to do better this year.<br/>

&gt; 202005.doc<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As you folks recall the clues were very obscure. I have posted a <br/>
&gt; file in the link section with the clues from last year and their <br/>
&gt; explanation of them is at the bottom. If you feel like having a <br/>
&gt; look, this may help to guess what they will be getting at this <br/>
year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It all starts on January 30, (I know, a long way off yet, but what <br/>
&gt; can I say, I'm excited). I'll start posting clues as I hear them <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; the radio. If this bothers anybody let me know offlist and I'll <br/>
find <br/>
&gt; another way to beg for help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>
