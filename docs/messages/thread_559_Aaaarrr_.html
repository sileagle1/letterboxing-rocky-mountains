Aaaarrr! cried the desert moab as they swaggered down the beach near <br/>
the takeout. Aaaarrr, again they cried from the top of a large rock <br/>
overlooking "x" marking the buried treasure. And again, Aaaarrr! as <br/>
they held aloft the pirate gold booty for all to admire. Aaaarrr! <br/>
they cried with a triumphant sneer as they swaggered back to their <br/>
vessel to drink a toast to the distant visiting pirates from <br/>
eastward.<br/>
