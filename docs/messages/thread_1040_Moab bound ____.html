that description.  Kat, is there a post spring break lull in the activity<br/>
over there?  Do you know when that would start and end?  We had hoped to<br/>
be travelling next week, but need to postpone that for the time being. <br/>
Has there been anymore talk of a Box on the Rocks II?<br/>

&gt; Chocolate pie.. nectar of the.. pirates...GARRR!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pre...what route are you taking?  Are you following I-70 all the way <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to Moab?<br/>
&gt; If so....Zeb Gump Grizzly Creek may be open. Zeb Gump Doc Holliday.. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; depends on the snow in Glenwood.  You could decide after you see <br/>
&gt; what <br/>
&gt; it's like when you get into the area.   I know that Zeb Gump Mustang <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and 16 ton are clear (although make sure the road to Mustang isn't <br/>
&gt; muddy!).  <br/>
&gt; Jimmy Buffet and Talk Like a Pirate (same park), all the Napolean <br/>
&gt; Dynamites (very easy to get all three in short time.. Lucky!!), Raft <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the River is a drive by, Pie Eating Contest and There Were These Two <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Guys (same park), Big Fish, Rocky Mountain Retro Candy (a little bit <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; of a walk to do the series but not a difficult one), Grand Valley, <br/>
&gt; Johnny Carino's, Commuting, Those Were the Days.. all of those are <br/>
&gt; clear as of right now.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; None of the ones that have the city of Mesa or Grand Mesa as the <br/>
&gt; closest are free of snow yet. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Y-nought's No Use should be clear... it may be too far in the wrong <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; direction for you depending on your itinerary and route.  You might <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; look at a map to get an idea. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you take the 'back' road into Moab you'll hit quite a few boxes <br/>
&gt; along that road.  Rather than go all the way down the highway to the <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; regular Moab exit, you take the small exit before it that says Cisco <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and head for the river.  The first box (The Westerns)is at the Dewey <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bridge.. which is immediately after you hit the river...and then <br/>
&gt; there are bunches all along the road all the way to Moab!  Don't <br/>
&gt; miss <br/>
&gt; Y-Nought's Alien Gothic.. it's one of my favorite boxes ever.  And <br/>
&gt; then there are like a BAJILLION in Moab!  Woohoo!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I missed any someone shout it out.  Oh, I know.. there's the <br/>
&gt; airport one which doesn't have posted clues.  If you want to try it <br/>
&gt; let me know and I'll direct you via email.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you want suggestions as to what order to do the Grand Junction <br/>
&gt; boxes in to get to them in a sort of geographical order let me know. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; And if you aren't coming through Grand Junction have a wonderful <br/>
&gt; time <br/>
&gt; anyway!<br/>
