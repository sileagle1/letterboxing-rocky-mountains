A Fairy Blessed Me<br>
Today a Fairy blessed me and danced upon these walls<br>
Left a scent of roses as she beckoned to my calls<br>
Gave me comfort, and wiped my tears<br>
blessed my mind of all those fears<br>

If you happen to be in the Glenwood Springs area, head up highway 133 <br>
past Carbondale to the small town of Redstone. Stop in and visit the <br>
local shop owners of this lovely little town, or continue about 2 <br>
miles farther up the road, between mile marker 49 and 50, to Hays <br>
Creek Falls. There isn't a lot to park in, just a little pull-out off <br>
the side of the road so watch your youngling and pets closely. <br>
<br>
Check out the falls  a perfect fairy home, don't you think? If you <br>
wander around the Redstone side of the falls, near the road, you may <br>
see a sign marking some underground phone lines. This muggle sign is <br>
simply to keep folks away from the fairy who lives here. If you head <br>
not but a dozen feet behind this sign, you will find two brother <br>
rocks leaning on one another guarded by pines and narrow leaf <br>
cottons. Between these brothers, tucked waaaayyy back in, is a <br>
perfect place to keep one's wings out of the spray of the falls.<br>
<br>
This is a drive up, but watch for people as they sporadically visit <br>
her abode to take a photo or two. Please be discreet and re-hide well <br>
to keep away prying eyes and so others may leave their mark in her <br>
guest book.<br>
<br>
<br>
Box 2 - Draig-Uisge (Water):<br>
Head west of Idaho Springs on I-70 to the turnoff for Fall River <br>
Road. Follow the signs for Fall River Road, and head up about 9 miles <br>
until you see the trailhead marked "glacier trail". Park on the left <br>
just past the trailhead sign About 3/4 of a mile up this VERY rocky <br>
path, you will find St. Mary's Glacier. (Make sure you bear left at <br>
the 1st two forks you come to.)<br>
<br>
Check out the lake and the glacier itself but make note - there are <br>
no amenities here such as bathrooms! <br>
<br>
Once you are done poking around, head to the south side of the <br>
bridge. Once there face away from the glacier, and set your compass <br>
to 136. About 65 paces away, you will see a tree that has been <br>
knocked over, and its roots are showing. Head to the root side of <br>
said tree and take another bearing at 110. You will see a very small <br>
stump no more than 13 paces away. Once there, check out the view at <br>
10. Framed between a 'V' shaped pine tree, you should see a rock <br>
with a small-ish pine tree behind it. On the north side of this pine <br>
the dragon who favors water should be sleeping.<br>
<br>
Note: This can be a VERY busy place depending on the season. Please <br>
be sure that you re-hide this box better than you found it, and be <br>
discreet when finding and hiding so that others may enjoy it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Happy hunting!<br>
