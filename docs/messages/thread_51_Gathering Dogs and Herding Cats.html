The 8/31 weekend was scrapped because its Labor Day, however the <br/>
polls are now showing that more folks would like that.  Personally, <br/>
that weekend looked great for me.<br/>

*pulls hair out*  I know, I know ... trying to organize a group of <br/>

Okay - If everyone who is interested in gathering before the end of <br/>
the month would post the date and location of their preference, we <br/>
can go with a majority.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Autumn, I empathize because I know how hard it is to plan something <br/>
for a group...you can't accomadate everyone.  But don't worry, I <br/>
agree, a majority vote will work.  My vote:  Either weekend with a <br/>
preference for the 23rd, at Roxborough.  I understand this won't <br/>
accomodate pets, but, once you're there, you'll see why...they're <br/>
trying to keep the area/wildlife as undisturbed as possible.  One <br/>
last note, I know there's a fee, but it only $5, and it goes to a <br/>
great cause...Colorado outdoors!  And, it's unbelievably beautiful!  <br/>
Okay, forgive me for pitching Roxborough, but, if not this outing, <br/>
in the future, you all gotta see it!  <br/>
