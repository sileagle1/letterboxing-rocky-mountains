I don't say much on this board, but, since the topic of cancer came <br/>
up, I thought I might share a story, and ask a favor.<br/>
<br/>
My sister-in-law passed away from cancer two years ago this last <br/>
Monday.  For the past year, my mother-in-law, a hospice nurse, has <br/>
been trying to start a non-profit hospice. My wife found a way to <br/>
help by entering her story in a Wells Fargo "Someday Dream" essay <br/>
contest(see story below).  She was chosen as a finalist, but now she <br/>
needs votes to win the funding to get the hospice running.  If you <br/>
would like to help, it won't cost you a penny.  Simply read the story <br/>
and:<br/>
<br/>
   1)  Go to www.wellsfargo.com/somedaystories and vote for Mary <br/>
Parott from Rye, CO.<br/>
<br/>
   2)  Send this "campaign chain letter" on to others who might care <br/>
to help and ask them to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
Your help is greatly appreciated,<br/>

                                         "THE ANGEL HOUSE"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   My mother, Linda Batts, a dedicated and gifted hospice nurse for <br/>
more than 20 years, has a dream of starting her own hospice.<br/>
   In September of 2006, her oldest daughter Michelle, my sister, <br/>
died from breast cancer.    My mother took care of her at home, <br/>
because my sister could not work, much less, afford  any health <br/>
benefits.  <br/>
   Through her devastation, she found not only a new purpose in life, <br/>
but a financial opportunity.  She just couldn't let someone, who is <br/>
terminally ill, die without proper care, just because they didn't <br/>
have health benefits.  So she and her best friend Pam Bomar, also a <br/>
hospice nurse, have decided to open a hospice of their own.  They <br/>
have recently purchased an old home, that will need renovations, <br/>
located in rural Greenhorn Valley, Colorado.  It will be called "The <br/>
Angel House", providing hospice care for low-income individuals on <br/>
Medicaid.  The closest hospice is 40 miles away.  <br/>
   The cost of the renovations was estimated, by a contractor, to be <br/>
between $95,000-$100,000.  The home will need four additional rooms <br/>
built on, as well as specialized bathing equipment.  They are doing <br/>
this on their nurses' salaries and donations, and are determined to <br/>
turn this "someday dream" into a reality.  Not only will this hospice <br/>
be a service to the community, but it would secure my mother <br/>
financially in her retiring years.  This really is my mom's "Big <br/>
Dream" and your help would make it happen!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

Another great cause that is free to participate in is clicking for <br/>
free mammograms for those women who cannot afford them. Go to <br/>
http://www.thebreastcancersite.com/clickToGive/home.faces?siteId=2<br/>
and click on the big pink button. I have it at the top of my <br/>
Favorites list and click on it when I first access the internet each <br/>
day; then I don't have to remember it again all day. It literally <br/>
takes only 2 clicks per day. Easy peasy!<br/>
