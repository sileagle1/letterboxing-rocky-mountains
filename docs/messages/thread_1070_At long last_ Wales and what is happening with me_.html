                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, so I was mean and dropped tantalizing hints without telling<br/>
anything specific.  I am back from the UK now and thought I would take a<br/>
moment to update you, my good friends, on why it was I went out to<br/>
Wales.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sad to say that I am going to be leaving the group this fall.  I<br/>
hope to still participate, but I am going to be moving to Great<br/>
Britain--Cardiff, Wales to be specific.  I am not at all sad to say the<br/>
reason.  I am engaged to marry a man who lives in Cardiff!<br/>
<br/>
He and I dated 13 years ago when we were in college, but the timing<br/>
wasn't right and I broke things off.  Neither of us has married since<br/>
and this year we reconnected.  It has been very right this time and<br/>
things have come together perfectly.  I am so happy!  The only thing<br/>
that makes me sad is the fact that I will be saying goodbye to so many<br/>
of my good friends that I have come to care about.  I am excited to go<br/>
there though.  We will marry here in Idaho, but will be moving in to his<br/>
flat that he owns there in Cardiff.  Luckily I really liked it there. <br/>
Cardiff was a great city with lots of fun things to do.  It will be an<br/>
adjustment for me after living in a town that is much smaller.  I am<br/>
also going to miss my mountains so much, but there are some nice<br/>
national parks close.<br/>
<br/>
So that's my news.  That is why I was a bit evasive in answering<br/>
questions about my trip.  We are planning on marrying in mid-October.  I<br/>
am just so very happy and wanted you all to be able to share in my<br/>
excitement.<br/>

Yes, Kat, I believe we must send a couple of LBs with Cadenza to<br/>
Cardiff. I may duplicate my When a Frog is a Horse LB; I do love the<br/>

&gt; &gt; Wales.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm sad to say that I am going to be leaving the group this <br/>
fall.  <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; hope to still participate, but I am going to be moving to Great<br/>
&gt; &gt; Britain--Cardiff, Wales to be specific.  I am not at all sad to <br/>
&gt; say the<br/>
&gt; &gt; reason.  I am engaged to marry a man who lives in Cardiff!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; He and I dated 13 years ago when we were in college, but the <br/>
timing<br/>
&gt; &gt; wasn't right and I broke things off.  Neither of us has married <br/>
&gt; since<br/>
&gt; &gt; and this year we reconnected.  It has been very right this time <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; things have come together perfectly.  I am so happy!  The only <br/>
&gt; thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; that makes me sad is the fact that I will be saying goodbye to so <br/>
&gt; many<br/>
&gt; &gt; of my good friends that I have come to care about.  I am excited <br/>
&gt; to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; there though.  We will marry here in Idaho, but will be moving in <br/>
&gt; to his<br/>
&gt; &gt; flat that he owns there in Cardiff.  Luckily I really liked it <br/>
&gt; there. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Cardiff was a great city with lots of fun things to do.  It will <br/>
&gt; be an<br/>
&gt; &gt; adjustment for me after living in a town that is much smaller.  I <br/>
&gt; am<br/>
&gt; &gt; also going to miss my mountains so much, but there are some nice<br/>
&gt; &gt; national parks close.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So that's my news.  That is why I was a bit evasive in answering<br/>
&gt; &gt; questions about my trip.  We are planning on marrying in mid-<br/>
&gt; October.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; am just so very happy and wanted you all to be able to share in my<br/>
&gt; &gt; excitement.<br/>

&gt; Yayyyyyyyyy, Cadenza!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What wonderful news.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can just picture you there. Perhaps getting over to Dartmoor <br/>
when <br/>
&gt; you go on holiday.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And you will always be an RMLetterboxer, wherever you are.<br/>
