                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, so I was mean and dropped tantalizing hints without telling<br>
anything specific.  I am back from the UK now and thought I would take a<br>
moment to update you, my good friends, on why it was I went out to<br>
Wales.<br>
<br>
I'm sad to say that I am going to be leaving the group this fall.  I<br>
hope to still participate, but I am going to be moving to Great<br>
Britain--Cardiff, Wales to be specific.  I am not at all sad to say the<br>
reason.  I am engaged to marry a man who lives in Cardiff!<br>
<br>
He and I dated 13 years ago when we were in college, but the timing<br>
wasn't right and I broke things off.  Neither of us has married since<br>
and this year we reconnected.  It has been very right this time and<br>
things have come together perfectly.  I am so happy!  The only thing<br>
that makes me sad is the fact that I will be saying goodbye to so many<br>
of my good friends that I have come to care about.  I am excited to go<br>
there though.  We will marry here in Idaho, but will be moving in to his<br>
flat that he owns there in Cardiff.  Luckily I really liked it there. <br>
Cardiff was a great city with lots of fun things to do.  It will be an<br>
adjustment for me after living in a town that is much smaller.  I am<br>
also going to miss my mountains so much, but there are some nice<br>
national parks close.<br>
<br>
So that's my news.  That is why I was a bit evasive in answering<br>
questions about my trip.  We are planning on marrying in mid-October.  I<br>
am just so very happy and wanted you all to be able to share in my<br>
excitement.<br>

Yes, Kat, I believe we must send a couple of LBs with Cadenza to<br>
Cardiff. I may duplicate my When a Frog is a Horse LB; I do love the<br>

What wonderful news.<br>

I can just picture you there. Perhaps getting over to Dartmoor when <br>
you go on holiday.<br>

And you will always be an RMLetterboxer, wherever you are.<br>

anything specific.  I am back from the UK now and thought I would take a<br>
moment to update you, my good friends, on why it was I went out to<br>
Wales.<br>
<br>
I'm sad to say that I am going to be leaving the group this fall.  I<br>
hope to still participate, but I am going to be moving to Great<br>
Britain--Cardiff, Wales to be specific.  I am not at all sad to say the<br>
reason.  I am engaged to marry a man who lives in Cardiff!<br>
<br>
He and I dated 13 years ago when we were in college, but the timing<br>
wasn't right and I broke things off.  Neither of us has married since<br>
and this year we reconnected.  It has been very right this time and<br>
things have come together perfectly.  I am so happy!  The only thing<br>
that makes me sad is the fact that I will be saying goodbye to so many<br>
of my good friends that I have come to care about.  I am excited to go<br>
there though.  We will marry here in Idaho, but will be moving in to his<br>
flat that he owns there in Cardiff.  Luckily I really liked it there. <br>
Cardiff was a great city with lots of fun things to do.  It will be an<br>
adjustment for me after living in a town that is much smaller.  I am<br>
also going to miss my mountains so much, but there are some nice<br>
national parks close.<br>
<br>
So that's my news.  That is why I was a bit evasive in answering<br>
questions about my trip.  We are planning on marrying in mid-October.  I<br>
am just so very happy and wanted you all to be able to share in my<br>
excitement.<br>
