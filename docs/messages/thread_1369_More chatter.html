                    <div class="plaintext-content">Bean, I am so sorry that box is gone!  Even though it was exposed when <br>
we found it, it seemed like people were leaving it alone.  And what a <br>
great stamp!  ::pat, pat::  I am rapidly getting sick of people who <br>
think it's okay to take these things.  <br>
<br>
I don't know if you all have been seeing what's going on in CT, but <br>
somone is stealing the boxes en masse.  As in dozens and dozens.  <br>
They're cleaning out entire parks and moving on to the next one.  SO.. <br>
if anyone has any boxes planted there I highly recommend that you <br>
archive your clues asap until this whole thing gets figured out and/or <br>
stopped.  It's sickening.<br>
<br>
I had such a great time meeting the visiting Missouri boxers.  What a <br>
hoot!  I'm inspired to do some extra neato boxes now after seeing their <br>
magic box of tricks.  And, uh, I'm pretty sure I need a personal <br>
traveler now, too.  Yowza!<br>
<br>
Es, zooming off to be first finder of a certain new box that got left <br>
behind in Palisade... ARRRRRRR!!!<br>

Everyone at the mini-meet had personal travelers, but us!  We're also<br>
feeling inspired to make a personal traveler.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh, that's so sad.  I knew this would happen one day, though.  Some <br>
years ago, I was talking about letterboxing with a relative and he said <br>
something like, "I think it would be fun, instead of collecting just <br>
the stamp images, to collect whole boxes."  He was kidding, of course, <br>
but I thought then, if he could think of this, someone more evil could <br>
also think of it, and I was pretty sure it would only be a matter of <br>
time before I was reading about this.  I mean really, what is to stop a <br>
person like that?  It's not against the law to take boxes, in fact, <br>
they could even be considered a hero of sorts for cleaning up "litter" <br>
in these parks.<br>
<br>
This is where it would be useful for an organization like LbNA to have <br>
some formal structure.  If it were incorporated, for instance, and <br>
these boxes could be considered LbNA property, perhaps LbNA could work <br>
with the parks to ensure letterboxes are not stolen somehow.<br>

Unfortunately, if the clues have already been printed that's no help.  <br>

At this point over 150 boxes have disappeared in a few days. <br>

I can't imagine how discouraging it must be for the planters.<br>
