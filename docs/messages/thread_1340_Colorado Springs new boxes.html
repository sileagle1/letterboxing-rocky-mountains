boxes I placed in the Springs! One is Mountain Screamer, a quick urban<br>
find.<br>

<br>
The other is Traveler's Rest HH Hotel that COdogscout and I hid<br>
together in Black Forest Park. I got the idea from a HH Hostel I found<br>
in Raleigh, NC over Christmas last year... I hadn't noticed the one in<br>
Golden!! Anyway, there are 4 HHs in there, waiting to be<br>
discovered/traded/taken away to exotic locales! And please, do go move<br>
the HHs (as long as you have one to trade)... a couple of them I got<br>
in NC and have had them for way too long!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for mentioning my Golden Hitchhiker Hostel.  The "Big Bison <br>
Hitchhiker Hostel" is an easy drive-by off I-70 at the Genesee Park <br>
exit.  As of today, there are three HHs in the hostel (two are NEW), <br>
waiting for visitors to take them away to new destinations. <br>
<br>
Bring a camera and pretend to be taking a photo of the wonderful view <br>
as you nab the box.  There are picnic areas in Genesee Park about 1 <br>
mile west of the overlook away that are perfect for stamping-in. <br>
Please rehide it well.<br>
<br>
I hope to visit your new Colorado Springs HHH next weekend and drop <br>
off a few HHs from the Denver area.<br>
