<br>
Last night, right at dark, the Bullet was found in a fake rock behind <br>
a man-made waterfall. The waterfall is part of the entrance to a <br>
subdivision by our new hospital.<br>
<br>
Get this.......the woman who found it said that she thought it would <br>
be cool if the Bullet was hidden in her subdivision so she just <br>
started looking around her neighborhood. Where the rocks are stacked <br>
for the waterfall it looks like a v within a V so she got the idea to <br>
look behind it.  Tom Little said that what he meant by v within a V <br>
was actually "W" which stands for Wilson Gulch....where the <br>
subdivision is.<br>
<br>
So, even though the clues so far were really very little help at all, <br>
the Bullet was found in almost record time. Which proves how hard it <br>
is to write clues that will make a treasure hunt last for a week.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think you guys had better ideas at hiding spots for <br>
this year's Bullet (in the HORN of a Dodge Viper?....brilliant!) than <br>
Tom did.......but you guys are letterboxers and are real pro's at <br>
this.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the FUN!<br>
<br>
y-nough<br>

Now....where is that pack of gum????????  <br>

p.s. YOUR bullet, Y, is actually a very small Altoid box that happens <br>
to be about the size of a pack of gum.  Same type of container as for <br>
Fandango as a matter of fact....  <br>

p.p.s.  Peach, funny you should mention being wayyyy out in left <br>
field.....<br>
