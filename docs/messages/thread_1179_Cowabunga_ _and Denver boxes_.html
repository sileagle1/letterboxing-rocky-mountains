                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the reminder to everyone about this temporary box FRH.  I <br/>
think kids would especially like this one, with big people <br/>
supervision, of course.<br/>
<br/>
I just looked at the October calendar and realistically won't be able <br/>
to pull this box until the weekend - so I'll leave it there until the <br/>
weekend of Oct 21st/22nd.<br/>
<br/>
I'd also like to point out that my seasonal Play Ball! box will be <br/>
removed in October too. Rather than removing it the 1st week of <br/>
October per the publicly listed clues, I'll leave it there until the <br/>
same weekend in October (above) when both it and Cowabunga! go "bye <br/>
bye".<br/>
<br/>
The logbook for Play Ball! should just make it through this year's <br/>
Rockies season before its full...<br/>
<br/>
pre<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I had fun finding pre's Cowabunga box today.  See the clues below.  <br/>
&gt; I recommend that people search for it before the cow parade <br/>
&gt; disappears next month.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Great stamp and log book, cleaverly hidden and lots of cool cows <br/>
&gt; nearby.<br/>
