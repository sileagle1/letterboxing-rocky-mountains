<br/>
This week I MADE myself go find The Onion II and Buffalo Bill Cody.  I<br/>
knew they would be easy enough, I just can never find the time to<br/>
squeeze in some boxing time.<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping if it isn't too cold next week I can go get a few more that<br/>
won't cause my 2 year old too much trouble.<br/>
<br/>
PS - I checked on Oh, Dear! , T-I-Double Guh-Er &amp; Fido last week.<br/>
Fido's log book was full, so I left a new one.  Oh, Dear! was in a place<br/>
I was told was a sensitive area, so I had to move it... but, it found a<br/>
new home.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a question  - when a log book fills up and you have to replace<br/>
it, what do you do with those who have already stamped in?  Ok, that<br/>
doesn't make sense.  When I go to a box, I love to see who has been<br/>
there before me.  WHen a log book gets switched out, you miss all those<br/>
prior images.  Do you have a way that incorporates the old log book into<br/>
the new one?<br/>
