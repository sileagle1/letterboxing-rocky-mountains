I (Puppypaws) hiked up on top of Carpenter's Peak yesterday and found <br>
out the bad news. I will not replace this box since I was going to <br>
remove it anyway; however, I wanted to put it inside the Visitor's <br>
Center.  I will try to get another one soon.  TDG and I really hiked <br>
fast yesterday - we left the visitor's center at 5:45p and the ranger <br>
did not think we could make it to the top and back before 9pm -  We <br>
did it!  I'm pooped. This was a beautiful time to hike on such a hot <br>
day - "Evenings in Roxborough" (maybe that would be a good box title)<br>
