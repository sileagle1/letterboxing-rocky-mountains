                    <div class="plaintext-content">Things I've learned while being snowboundso far at least...<br/>
<br/>
Frosty the Snowman is a Sicko.  He's NOT cute.  He's an evil twisted <br/>
individual who needs to be flattened by a snowplow, "soon-ish."   <br/>
Along with his corncob pipe and button nose....We'll find those last <br/>
two come spring.....maybe. <br/>
<br/>
"Black eyes" made out of coal sounds a LOT like "black ice."<br/>
<br/>
Driving, like voting, is a privledge not a right in Denver.  ha!  Be <br/>
patient enough and you just might be "allowed to."<br/>
<br/>
A snowplow making its way down one's Denver residential street is a <br/>
Betting Matter with your neighbors while you're out on the <br/>
street..shoveling, always shoveling.  Most of us bet a plow is never <br/>
coming, but the postal person doesafter 7 days, or there abouts.  <br/>
Aka "soon-ish."<br/>
<br/>
"Climbing" a parking meter barely sticking out of 3-4 feet of snow <br/>
to attempt to put in coins can be amusing and might earn you some <br/>
honks and thumbs up because, well, that's just silly, but HAS been <br/>
done... Trust me on this one.<br/>
<br/>
Watching a US Mail/FedEx/UPS truck get stuck is entertaining .if <br/>
viewed from the warmth of your home and you ain't the poor driver, <br/>
but it DOES get old after ..a week, bless their hearts.  Saying to a <br/>
driver of said trucks while you're out shoveling "How you holding <br/>
up?  Sure is nice to see you out on our street" earns you a big <br/>
beaming smile, but do NOT mention being stuck in the snow.  On <br/>
either end of the convo!...Ever!<br/>
<br/>
For you pirate types, "Grabbing the Booty" at least as insinuated by <br/>
Craig Ferguson on the Late Late show can SO mean something erm <br/>
else.  I never thought about it THAT way beforedunno why.  Must be <br/>
the benefit of watching re-runs and being bored out of my ever-<br/>
loving mind.<br/>
<br/>
Milk, eggs, bread, wiper fluid and the use of a shovel are worth at <br/>
least their weights in gold, yet CAN be bartered Trust me on this <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
Baking stuff, like pie, usually takes eggs or milk and sure warms up <br/>
the place! But must ALWAYS be shared :-)<br/>
<br/>
The grocery store might have empty shelves but the liquor store <br/>
never does.  This a good thing!  DOH!<br/>
<br/>
DIA = Death In an Airport.  Nuff said.  Ahem.  <br/>
<br/>
Dogs frolicking in the snow are unbelievably cute!  1-2 foot long <br/>
icicles hanging from one's roof while looking out at what looks like <br/>
a dawn glow with all that reflection....at 3:30 am is NOT to be <br/>
forgotten! Ever!<br/>
<br/>
Sledding down the slope in front of the State ferking Capitol is, <br/>
well...ferking cool!<br/>
<br/>
"Do you mind giving me a push?" is the new motto of Denver.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year!  <br/>
<br/>
pre :-)<br/>
With a new snow shovel for digging out letterboxes....or making <br/>
super duper sandcastles....next time I find myself near a warm sunny <br/>
wnow-free! beach......<br/>

canines!)<br/>
<br/>
Thought I'd check in on you guys, now that the excitement has died<br/>
down, and you're (PREhaps) out and about again. Boy, was I glad not<br/>
to be anywhere near the Denver airport in all that hullabaloo. I<br/>
listened to Car Talk last weekend and there was a woman who got<br/>
caught in the blizzard (she said the weather report called for the<br/>
storm to seriously hit in the mid-state in the afternoon, and she<br/>
was south in the morning), and had to drive a couple of hundred miles<br/>
in first gear in her auto trans Forester. She said it was so icy she<br/>
didn't dare touch the brakes, and sometimes, even in first, the rpms<br/>
were redlining. eek. Our one real storm of the season was the weekend<br/>
after Thanksgiving, and I was driving back from my sister's in Salinas<br/>
when I crashed into the truck that had spun into my lane. My Forester<br/>
gave it's life for me (the photos are pretty impressive!) and I'm<br/>
fine, not to mention infinitely grateful. Loving the new Outback, too.<br/>
<br/>
These Sierra mountains sure could use some of your snow. This seems to<br/>
be the winter all the precip is passing us by. We did get to enjoy a<br/>
of couple weeks of single digit temps (pretty unusual for us), but we<br/>
need COVERAGE!!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; but it DOES get old after ..a week, bless their hearts.  Saying to a <br/>
&gt; driver of said trucks while you're out shoveling "How you holding <br/>
&gt; up?  Sure is nice to see you out on our street" earns you a big <br/>
&gt; beaming smile, but do NOT mention being stuck in the snow.<br/>
<br/>
Holding out a mug of something hot while you ask the question will<br/>
earn you BIG brownie points!<br/>
<br/>
I will be in Santa Fe from Feb 2-9, and will be getting together with<br/>
Astro D, Lionsmane, and some other local boxers on the 6th or 7th.<br/>
Would love to meet any RM boxers that might be in the area at the same<br/>
time. The weekend before could be ok for me, we just delayed our<br/>
getting together because Mark will be going to the Tucson gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Just finished a really groovy *pirate* stamp for my next box. Yes, it<br/>
will be in California. (come on over! the water's fine!)<br/>
<br/>
Stay warm!<br/>

artTrekker, also curious about Cadenza--has anyone tried to reach her<br/>
directly? (I thought she got married in Colorado in August...)<br/>

  I have one box planned for downtown, I just have to get off my rear and do it!  I have also toyed with a few ideas to go with many of the beautiful old buildings that are downtown, particularly the old churches, and have been digging around the haunted history of Denver looking for inspiration.<br/>

  I'll get to it!  Aljan  <br/>
