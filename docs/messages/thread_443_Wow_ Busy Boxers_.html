Oh sure, I go away for a while and everyone has a posting party! <br/>
Worst of all, I forgot to take my boxing pack on my trip and <br/>
probably missed a bunch of boxes. Oh well, there were lot's of new <br/>
tempting boxes planted while I was away, so that's fun! (We went on <br/>
a Disney cruise and their ship theatre played National Treasure 5 <br/>
times a day! For free! And free snacks! Es is perking up at that <br/>
statement!)<br/>

Welcome back, Kat. I saw that a new box was planted between you and <br/>
me by someone from the Far East. I'll race ya.<br/>
