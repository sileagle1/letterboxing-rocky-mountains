                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to let everyone know, just in case you might be planning on coming up and squeezing in a few boxes while the weather is still holding out, that the clues for Spirit Lake have been amended.  Please print out the newest version!  Apparently the tables that I had used as a starting point had been moved and Front Range HIker and the H-As had quite an adventure wandering around, looking for the box!  The clues are now based on some more stationary objects.<br/>
<br/>
and...<br/>
<br/>
A new box of mine has popped up!  ...but, it hasn't been planted yet!  I thought that I could put the clues in and leave the link line blank and that it would only show up for me until I was ready to post it.  That way when I am at the in-laws trying to get the clues posted before we fly fly away for Halloween it would be quick and easy.  Apparently not.  It is there with all the history and no clues for now!  I made a note in the clues that I am planning on getting itplanted on Oct 26th, just in time for Halloween, which will be very appropriate.  It's a beauty!  Might be one of my favs!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  Aljan <br/>
