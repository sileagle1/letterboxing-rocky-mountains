days like this.  There were many, many posts that stemmed from this <br/>
thread.  One in particular was from a person who was trying to poll <br/>
the group to find out who was pagan/gay/etc ... <br/>
<br/>
I think its totally wrong for anyone to be posting about religion on <br/>
that list. (Christian, pagan, klingon ... whatever!  hehe)  And I <br/>
told them so.  I think the vents to this list have been well <br/>
restrained, too.<br/>
<br/>
I think we have a small enough group here that we can all be <br/>
respectful of each other's life choices.  While we may not all share <br/>
the same beliefs, sexual orientation, careers, or goals ...  We do <br/>
all share a hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I'm happy this list remembers that.<br/>
