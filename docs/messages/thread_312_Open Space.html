                    <div class="plaintext-content">Jeffoco Open Space is basically open area that is owned by the county.<br>
Most are just parking lots with trails and such.  Most have some sort of<br>
pinic tables and outhouses/toilets.  But, they are not considered parks<br>
(no toys, grass, gardening, etc).  <br>
 <br>
Hope that helps =]<br>
 <br>
If you go to their website, there is a list of the open areas in<br>
Jefferson County.<br>
http://www.co.jefferson.co.us/ext/dpt/comm_res/openspac/leadpg2.htm<br>
 <br>
History of the Program<br>
The Open Space Program began in 1972 when the citizens of Jefferson<br>
County, Colorado believed so strongly in the need to preserve open space<br>
that they voted to tax themselves one-half of one percent on sales to<br>
fund planning, acquiring, maintaining and preserving open space<br>
properties.<br>
<br>
In 1980, an election expanded the use of Open Space funds to allow for<br>
the construction, maintenance and management of park and recreation<br>
facilities.  Expanded use of the Open Space funds has enabled the<br>
program to provide campgrounds at White Ranch and Reynolds Parks,<br>
multiple sports facilities at Clement Park, as well as assisting in the<br>
development of several publicly owned athletic fields, playgrounds,<br>
swimming pools, golf courses, picnic shelters, restrooms, recreation<br>
centers, regional parks and trails.  <br>
<br>
In 1998, voters in Jefferson County were asked to authorize $160 million<br>
in general obligation bonds to fund acquisition of priority properties.<br>
The issue passed with over 70% of the voters supporting the aggressive<br>
acquisition plan.  Fact<br>

<br>
Distribution of Funds<br>
The Jefferson County one-half of one percent sales tax collected by the<br>
Open Space Program is allocated to cities and to the unincorporated<br>
areas of the county.  The Open Space Program manages the majority of<br>
Open Space lands acquired in the unincorporated areas.  Other lands and<br>
recreational facilities acquired with Open Space funds are owned and/or<br>
managed by the cities or recreation districts.  The Open Space Program<br>
does not utilize funds from property taxes or the Colorado Lottery.<br>
Open Space does apply for special project grants from Great Outdoors<br>
Colorado and other funds. <br>
<br>
<br>
Since 1972, over $211 million have been spent in the cities and<br>
unincorporated areas of the county to acquire over 43,000 acres of land,<br>
water and facilities.  Through the Joint Venture Capital Program, more<br>
than $28 million have been spent for parks, trails, golf courses,<br>
recreational improvements and development projects for cities and<br>
recreation districts located within Jefferson County.  Between $1.5 and<br>
$2 million dollars are allocated each year through the Joint Ventures<br>
program. Over $20 million have been allocated for the Trails 2000<br>
program to acquires and develop approximately 100 miles of trail and<br>
trail connectors. Bond Update<br>
