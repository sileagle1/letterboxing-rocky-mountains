Looks like the East entrance is OPEN! Whoohooo! I leave this evening, <br/>
and will update on everyone as to boxes we find. We are so excited! <br/>
There are so few boxes in the Rocky Mountain Region (comparably) so <br/>
it's always fun to go a smidge further to get some new ones!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to everyone with news on the Cu box. It has been repaired, <br/>
but we did not bring a pen and the message inside it is still pretty <br/>
much illegible. When we return from vacation, we will re-write it. <br/>
There is a stamp from SCOTLAND in it!! Too cool!<br/>
<br/>
See you all on the other side.<br/>

one in Woody is very smudgy due to its wet condition.<br/>

I thought that was so cool to have a stamp from so far away.<br/>
