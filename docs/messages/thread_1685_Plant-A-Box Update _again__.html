                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a success!  <br>
So far (through 4/20/09 based on what's been posted) we have 51 boxes planted by folks who have signed up for the "event" and another 17 boxes planted by folks who are probably unaware of the event, but I'm counting them anyway ... just cuz.  68 new boxes in our region, folks!  <br>
<br>
There are hitchhikers and bonus boxes out there - and incredible new series to find!  I know there are more on the way, just based on what folks have been emailing me (and the fact that I have a box in my bag waiting to be planted)!    <br>
<br>
Thank you to everyone who has been planting, carving, clue-writing, logbook making, and lock 'n lock shopping!  <br>
<br>
Three events are happening - <br>
4/25 - Ravenwolf is hosting a workshop<br>
5/2 - a Utah gathering and a Denver gathering<br>
Atlas Quest has the details on those things, or email me if you want the skinny.  <br>

I have two boxes to put out. I don't think I'm going to make it for April though!<br>

Our gathering that CW Sun Seeker hosted in SLC was a huge success!  Our biggest group to date.  It's so much fun to see our numbers grow and such delightful new faces to look for out on the trail.  I've gotten caught up in their infectious newbie enthusiasm.  Just what I needed!<br>
