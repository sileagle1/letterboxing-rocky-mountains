By any chance does anyone know how long it takes to drive to some of the possible gathering spots (or at least some major cities) from any town near Idaho Falls, ID (Eastern ID).  I want to come but don't have vacation time left, so if I can make it it will be a drive in, drive out during the weekend.  It might also be a good chance to get some WY boxes along the way.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to make a post to the main list saying there is a gathering in the works as there are some who don't subscribe to this list yet that might come.  FYI-I  told some boxers that I know in UT about this list and they were excited.  I believe at least one person joined it.  Have we considered making a post to the main list just saying that there is a group for the Rockies in case there is interest?  I thought about mentioning it, but wasn't sure of protocol.<br/>
<br/>
happy hunting,<br/>

<blockquote><tt>I am heading up early Tuesday morning (first thing).  Unfortunately, <br/>
I am carpooling with someone else.  So ... I will probably not be <br/>
able to stop for that letterbox until later.  My plan is to leave the <br/>
campsite on Wednesday to hike for it.  I can't go this weekend, <br/>
unfortunately.  (rats).  <br/>
<br/>
I'd be willing to drive down to Bailey to meet you there, though - if <br/>
you'd like to wait until Wednesday?  We'd just need to set a time <br/>
early in the day, as my hubby will be driving up to camp with me that <br/>
afternoon, and I'd like to be on-site when he arrives.<br/>
<br/>
On the gathering front, we have not picked a date and time.  Only a <br/>
few folks have responded to the poll regarding the best time to <br/>
meet.  I think a gathering at Roxborough State Park would be <br/>
spiff ... but I'm really open.  I'd love to just potluck and meet <br/>
everyone for exchange and such. :)<br/>

&gt; When are you heading up to Bailey or did you already?  My car is <br/>
now fixed and I am ready to head out.  I have work to do for a change <br/>
so I am thinking that I will head out some time this weekend.  Let me <br/>
know about Bailey.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Talk to you soon!!<br/>

&gt; PS:  Have we picked a gathering date yet?  I am getting very <br/>
anxious and excited!!!<br/>

I think its a whopping 700+ miles from Idaho Falls to the metro <br/>
Denver area.  You'd have to go (most likely) I-15 to I-84 to I-80 and <br/>
then I-25.  That's a long drive for a drive in/out weekend.  Sheesh - <br/>
you'd be driving for a loooong day each way.  :(  However, if you <br/>
came in, we'd put you up for the night!  <br/>
<br/>
Yes - I'm going to post on the main list that we're attempting a <br/>
gathering.  But feel free to tell others about this list, if you <br/>
think they'd be interested.  (protocol - schmotocol)<br/>
<br/>
Can everyone post in the poll about which weekend works for them?<br/>
