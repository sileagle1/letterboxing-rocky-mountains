A PR is a promotional tool. A PR might be a collaborative effort, <br>
especially when all parties? (or at least one in particular) start <br>
at the beginning, have complete information , pay attention, and <br>
want to play along. The more one does, perhaps the more things <br>
might come together in Denver on or about 8/28/08.<br>
<br>
A NastY cartoonist, among many others, might tell you that Pre <br>
Research can be a PR, as well.<br>
<br>
This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private, but not <br>
all notes are for all who haven't tendered. <br>
<br>
Alternatively: a PR is a short way of saying "omg what is that that <br>
wacky boxer called PRE up to again"!!??... marker fumes, blonde hair <br>
and all that.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's my story, so far, and I'm sticking to it....with <br>
magnets, if things go like they often do.....<br>
