                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay - braving the rush hour traffic and fading evening light, I <br/>
hiked up Dakota Ridge last night and checked on both boxes. <br/>
<br/>
Litha is exactly where it was supposed to be.  Several vistors - <br/>
including the infamous Wanda (of Pete &amp; Wanda) who made this box her <br/>
3303rd find.  I may adjust the clues a bit, but let's face it, it's <br/>
just hidden well.<br/>
<br/>
Rain Cloud was in fine shape.  I replaced the log book and will be <br/>
sending the full book along to Funhog this week.  This area needs <br/>
another box, and had there been another hour or so of light to work <br/>
with, I might have hidden another one up there. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Autumn<br/>
