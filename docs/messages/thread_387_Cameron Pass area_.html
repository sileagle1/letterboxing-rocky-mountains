Hey Staci!<br/>
<br/>
I wrote an email to the State parks of Colorado to see what I needed <br/>
if I wanted to put a letterbox somewhere. This is what they said:<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your inquiry into Colorado state parks' policy <br/>
concerning<br/>
geocaching and letterboxing. As far as I am aware, there are no<br/>
regulations with respect to these hobbies. However, I am certain that <br/>
these<br/>
activities would be allowed in our parks provided that the animals and<br/>
environment would not experience a disturbance.<br/>
<br/>
If you have additional questions, or if I can be of any more <br/>
assistance,<br/>
please feel free to contact me. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Cherylynne Gerton<br/>
Administrative Assistant III<br/>
Colorado State Parks<br/>
<br/>
I would imagine you could get info from other states the same way. <br/>
Good luck with that!<br/>
<br/>
~RavenWolf~<br/>
