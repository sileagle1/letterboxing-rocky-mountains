Ohhhhh, BIG sadness! One of my boxes with one of my best stamps in it <br/>
has been washed away in the California storms last week. I was so <br/>
sure it was planted up high enough, but rainwater flowing down from <br/>
the street above washed away the hiding rocks, and then it looked <br/>
like big waves also hit! Sooooo bummmmmed. It was in a good box, so <br/>
maybe it will wash up on some beach somewhere and someone will find <br/>
it. On the happy side, however, there are four new boxes planted in <br/>
this area, so I'll ease my pain by going on the hunt! Hope everyone's <br/>
having a good week!<br/>

I'm so sorry your box is gone.  I don't think any amount of good <br/>
hiding skills could have saved a box in that area, though.  <br/>
<br/>
I want to know how you managed to be seated at the right table in <br/>
the restaurant to be able to get the box hidden underneath! I mean.. <br/>
were there already people sitting there?<br/>
<br/>

It would be so cool if it washed up on shore somewhere and someone <br/>
found it. Kind of like a HH, but moving around by itself. Or if a <br/>
pirate ship hauled it in on the open sea thinking there might be pie <br/>
inside.<br/>
