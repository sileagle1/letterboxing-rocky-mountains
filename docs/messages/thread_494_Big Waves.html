Ohhhhh, BIG sadness! One of my boxes with one of my best stamps in it <br>
has been washed away in the California storms last week. I was so <br>
sure it was planted up high enough, but rainwater flowing down from <br>
the street above washed away the hiding rocks, and then it looked <br>
like big waves also hit! Sooooo bummmmmed. It was in a good box, so <br>
maybe it will wash up on some beach somewhere and someone will find <br>
it. On the happy side, however, there are four new boxes planted in <br>
this area, so I'll ease my pain by going on the hunt! Hope everyone's <br>
having a good week!<br>

I'm so sorry your box is gone.  I don't think any amount of good <br>
hiding skills could have saved a box in that area, though.  <br>
<br>
I want to know how you managed to be seated at the right table in <br>
the restaurant to be able to get the box hidden underneath! I mean.. <br>
were there already people sitting there?<br>
<br>
Es, eating sympathy pie for Kat<br>

It would be so cool if it washed up on shore somewhere and someone <br>
found it. Kind of like a HH, but moving around by itself. Or if a <br>
pirate ship hauled it in on the open sea thinking there might be pie <br>
inside.<br>

I was actually *eating* pie when I read this and almost choked on it <br>
laughing.  <br>
"Arrrrrr...tupperware ahoy! Drop the anchor, throw out the nets and <br>
grab yer forks... thar be pie, ya scurvey mongrels! Yo ho yo ho a <br>
pirates life for meeeee..."<br>

owners but still feeling sad for Kat's lost box<br>
