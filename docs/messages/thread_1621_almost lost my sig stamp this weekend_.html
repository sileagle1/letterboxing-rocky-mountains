I guess it serves me right for joking about my sig stamp being lost or <br>
stolen by a giant scary eagle or the like.  (But I was SO envious of <br>
Autumn's great new creation - and I'm even more envious now that I <br>
have the new stamp in my logbook!)  <br>
<br>
I was doing TaiChi and ChaiTea's Blue Spruce series.  I stamped into <br>
the first one but when I got to the second, my stamp was gone.  I was <br>
starting to think that I'd invited bad luck by kidding around about <br>
something happening to it.  I was also thinking that nobody would <br>
believe it was an accident after how I went on and on about my stamp <br>
being lost.  Fortunately, I went back to the first box and found it on <br>
the ground there - I guess it fell out of my bag.  <br>
<br>
The moral of the story, I guess, is don't invite bad stamp karma or <br>
you may get it!<br>
