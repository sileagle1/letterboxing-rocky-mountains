boxes around this area.  Late yesterday afternoon, I went for a walk <br/>
down the South Platte River - the river is higher than it has been in <br/>
several years.  I saw a beaver swimming in the river - then walked on <br/>
a while and saw four screech owls sitting in a clump of trees waiting <br/>
for a meal.....but I had already passed several rabbits,   so I told <br/>
them they were a little too far North -  ha!  Finally, maybe we will <br/>
get some warm weather because I want to go find Onion and several <br/>
others in the mountains and I don't want to wade through snow to do <br/>
it.  I am going to have to have some help with this onion....can <br/>
anyone give me a little help??? I deciphered the first part.  Puppypaws<br/>
