How do people find out about letterboxing?  In our case, our "art<br/>
oriented" librarian gave our son a copy of The Letterboxing Companion<br/>
about a year ago.  We read the whole thing cover to cover a couple of<br/>
times before we ever went searching for our first box.  After seeing<br/>
lots<br/>
of good box examples, we're working on some of our own boxes.  We've<br/>
introduced letterboxing to 2 or 3 individuals we thought would really<br/>
appreciate the art of it.  Otherwise, it's really more of a family<br/>
secret.  I just assume the whole letterboxing thing grow slowly and stay<br/>
manageable in size.<br/>

letterboxing this weekend?<br/>

Because, if they are, I'm seriously thinking about gathering up all <br/>
my logbooks (replacing them with new ones) so that the stamps I have <br/>
will be safe and I can enjoy them.  I'm still smarting after losing <br/>
the two that disappeared. The boxes would still be out but have new <br/>
journals.  And, maybe not all of them, but the more urban boxes that <br/>
seem to get the most visitors. <br/>

Crazy? More crazy than usual? <br/>

I saw two sentences about it in Backpacker Magazine, around April <br/>
2003. They said it was "geocacheing for luddites". I didn't know what <br/>
geocacheing was, but I was intrigued by outdoor games. I found out <br/>
that there is a lot to it, and I am still learning about letterboxing <br/>
all the time.<br/>

I read about Letterboxing in the July 26 issue of Time magazine.  <br/>
Within two weeks we were out finding our first box ("Woody the <br/>
Beaver" - thank you Debbi Scott!).  We have stamped in on 11 <br/>
letterboxes in less than a month and are preparing to place our <br/>
first, hopefully this weekend.<br/>
