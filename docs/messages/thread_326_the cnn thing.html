letterboxing this weekend?<br>

Because, if they are, I'm seriously thinking about gathering up all <br>
my logbooks (replacing them with new ones) so that the stamps I have <br>
will be safe and I can enjoy them.  I'm still smarting after losing <br>
the two that disappeared. The boxes would still be out but have new <br>
journals.  And, maybe not all of them, but the more urban boxes that <br>
seem to get the most visitors. <br>

Crazy? More crazy than usual? <br>

I saw two sentences about it in Backpacker Magazine, around April <br>
2003. They said it was "geocacheing for luddites". I didn't know what <br>
geocacheing was, but I was intrigued by outdoor games. I found out <br>
that there is a lot to it, and I am still learning about letterboxing <br>
all the time.<br>

  How do people find out about letterboxing?  <br>
<br>
  We learned about it in the Sept 03 issue of Family Fun Magazine<br>

Newbie checking in...<br>
I read about Letterboxing in the July 26 issue of Time magazine.  <br>
Within two weeks we were out finding our first box ("Woody the <br>
Beaver" - thank you Debbi Scott!).  We have stamped in on 11 <br>
letterboxes in less than a month and are preparing to place our <br>
first, hopefully this weekend.<br>
