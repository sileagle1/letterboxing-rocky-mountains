drive down together.  I was planning on camping in my new tent, there<br/>
is some really fun camping down there.  I have been trying to think of<br/>
someone who might be able to come down with me though since I don't<br/>
feel as comfortable camping all alone.  What do you think?  I would<br/>
have to be coming early Saturday afternoon and I have taken Monday off<br/>
of work so I can drive back (and box along the way).  I would love to<br/>
have a boxing partner with me.  I also have to be up very early<br/>
Saturday morning, so I have been a little nervous about driving 8<br/>
hours alone.<br/>

Wouldn't it be funny if we had to go all the way to Moab to meet, when we <br/>
only live about 15 miles apart?<br/>

That is a good idea, Ramdelt. Everyone can rest assured that at 2 p.m. <br/>
Sunday there will either be a gathering or a BIG sign at Rotary Park in <br/>
Moab. But I think we can have fun under the shelter rain or shine.<br/>
<br/>
I think the nametag idea might be in order too, Puppypaws. I'll pick <br/>
some blanks up for us to stamp and write on.<br/>

Letterboxing in the snow is fun!  It would probably be easier than the <br/>
rain. :)  I suspect wind would be the most annoying, though. <br/>
<br/>
In Grand Junction, which is 90 minutes east, we are currently having <br/>
blustery wind, but at 11 a.m. the sky looks like it's trying to clear <br/>
up and there's quite a bit of blue breaking through.  Woot! It seemed <br/>
like it was trying very hard to rain this morning, but maybe it's given <br/>
up.  <br/>
<br/>
And don't forget to take pictures! Lots of pictures!!<br/>
<br/>
Everyone drive safely!  Have a wonderful time!!<br/>
