HONEYWINE LETTERBOX CLUES<br/>
<br/>
I dont care for honey wine, <br/>
But the view from there is mighty fine.<br/>
<br/>
Down thirty four a treasure lies.  <br/>
The evening sun may blind your eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Silo one is painted blue.<br/>
Silo green is number two.<br/>
<br/>
Go a hundred yards beyond,<br/>
Hang a right youll see a pond.<br/>
<br/>
Three ponds lie within the dyke.<br/>
Stroll around them if you like. <br/>
<br/>
At middle pond theres something more<br/>
Hidden near its eastern shore.<br/>
<br/>
A young trio of cottonwoods stand<br/>
Where the water meets the land.<br/>
<br/>
Look beneath and youll discover<br/>
A flattened rock that is a cover.<br/>
<br/>
Covers what? You may wonder.<br/>
Could it be?  Secret plunder?<br/>
