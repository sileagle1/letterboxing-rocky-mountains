Unsinkable is currently M.I.A.  I plan on replacing, but not sure when I'll get to it.<br>
<br>
Monsieur Fromage may also be M.I.A. - I was there right after one of our recent storms and am not sure I did a good job looking thoroughly  Will try again.  However, since this stamp was from an out of stater, if it's missing it will not be replaced.<br>
<br>
TTDIDWYD: #1 Riverside went missing last fall, probably due to some clean up.  I plan on replacing, but can't guarantee when.<br>
<br>
Pinnacle of Success - found empty box, contents missing.  Box is retired.<br>
<br>
Ah spring...<br>

> Play Ball! would normally be making its seasonal appearance about now, but I never pulled it last year.  Just so you know, beginning with this season it's a permanent box and with a permanent stamp.  I won't be changing out the image with each year anymore.  Checked up on this box yesterday and the small logbook is close, but not quite full. I'd apPREciate knowing when it's down to space for only 1-2 more stamps and I'll replace the book.<br>
