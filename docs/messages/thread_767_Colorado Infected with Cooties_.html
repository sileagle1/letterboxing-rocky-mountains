<br/>
I was just getting back into the routine after a long backpacking <br/>
trip when I ran into secret agents Max and 99 from North Carolina. <br/>
While I wasn't looking they slipped me a Cootie. So now I'm giving <br/>
fair(e) warning that any contact with other letterboxers could lead <br/>
to infection.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could get it up to Idaho this weekend because I heard that <br/>
Cooties make good fishing bait. Maybe you folks have some of your own <br/>
already.<br/>
<br/>
I guess until I get rid of it I'll just have to have a peice of this <br/>
delicious pie that Kris brought, (welcome Kris, I live in Durango, <br/>
CO), and console myself by checking up on a few logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
y-nought, glad to see that folks are able to get out and do some <br/>
summer 'boxing.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I noticed that Black Footed Ferret is showing up on the LBNA map <br/>
under Western Slope...... I must have misplaced Teller County. I'll <br/>
see if Choi can fine tune that for us.<br/>
