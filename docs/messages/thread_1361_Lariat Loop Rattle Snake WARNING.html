life!  And to think I almost didn't grab that stick....<br>
<br>
A rattlesnake has taken up residence in the very same hole as my <br>
Lariat Loop: Red Box! <br>
<br>
Getting goosebumps thinking about it...even 24 hours later.<br>
<br>
To be safe, I also put notes along the loop in case anyone has <br>
already printed clue sheets (like visitors from MO?).<br>
<br>
I'm not going anywhere near that box until fall (at which point I'll <br>
move it).  I'm going back with tongs, gloves up to my shoulders, and <br>
maybe a snake-proof full-body suit made of metal, plus nerves of <br>
steel.<br>
<br>
Serously: Please do NOT attempt this box until it can be moved in the <br>
fall.<br>
<br>
Please be careful out there everyone!<br>

the red box tomorrow.  Any chance we could bribe what we need from the red <br>
box to continue on?  I've brought some good goodies just for such <br>
transactions.  If not, no big deal.  Seems there's plenty to grab before <br>
meeting up.<br>

SO looking forward to it!<br>
