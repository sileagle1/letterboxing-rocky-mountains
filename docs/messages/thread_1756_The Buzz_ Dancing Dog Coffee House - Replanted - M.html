                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Dancing Dog Coffee Shop went out of business in 2008 and sadly the original Letterboxing went missing not too long after the shop closed.  I thought the Dancing Dog was just as cute as a button so I planned on re-carving the image and eventually re-planting the box.  Today I finally re-carved the image of the Dancing Dog opened my logbook from April 2007 and low and behold I discovered that I had carved a different image of the Dancing Dog.  Although both were from the coffee shop that closed I somehow managed to forget which one I had carved originally and ended up with the other image.  My original carving was more of an outline.  This new carving is "carved out".  I encourage past finders to find the new Dancing Dog.  In addition to the carving changing he is also in a "Hit and Run" magnetic container and does not have a logbook.  He has also moved from his original location since the coffee shop is gone.  The closest coffee shop is across the street inside Fred Meyer in case you need a caffeine fix.<br>
