After spending about an hour in construction delays I headed home planning to leave a note for Silver Eagle hoping that we could meet up for an exchange.  After following a car for a bit that looked a bit lost, thinking I had scored the right people, I gave up and headed to one of my boxes.  Passed a nice looking family close to the box with a couple of kids who seemed to be having fun pegging each other with pine cones and a Dad who was awfully smiley about the whole affair...    I turned around to take a second look, wondering if his pack could be holding a journal and stamps and there was the LBNA patch that gave him away... then I wasn't so freaked out to ask a total stranger, hey!  Are you Silver Eagle?  It was perfect timing.  We had a nice exchange and chatted for a bit.  What a nice guy!<br/>

A fine ending to a highly enjoyable weekend!<br/>

Well, I just got back from the Palooza, and, boy, is my kilt tired. <br/>
My boys and I had the greatest time. We were kinda choked up when it <br/>
was over and we had to leave the magical kingdom full of great <br/>
letterboxers behind. It was only my second gathering, but in some <br/>
ways it felt like a reunion with dear old friends. Old friends that <br/>
are crazy about letterboxing and understand my fervor, that is.<br/>
<br/>
Dixie, those pictures are great! So funny to see that you spotted us <br/>
on our quest for Huzzah2! We didn't see you because we were so <br/>
determined to find it and get back to the faire. <br/>
<br/>
I found some great letterboxes on the way up and back, but not as <br/>
many as I had hoped for. I guess I'll have to start making plans for <br/>
another trip. Nothing like talking with a group of letterboxers to <br/>
get you revved up. (I think that picture of Stupender Man expresses <br/>
that perfectly)!!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to the next gathering,<br/>
<br/>
y-nought, <br/>

It was really fun to run into Silver Eagle and his fam.  We had a great time exchanging and chatting.<br/>
