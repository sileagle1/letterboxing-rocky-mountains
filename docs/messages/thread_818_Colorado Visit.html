Colorado and Wyoming and thought I would post a quick<br>
note of thanks to all of you that placed boxes in<br>
these beautiful states.  I managed to find several<br>
by different placers and all of them were in great<br>
places with awesome stamps.  You are some of the most<br>
talented carvers I have ever seen! <br>
Also, special thanks to Y-Nought for setting up the<br>
meeting at Castle Rock with Es, Sasha and wee-noughts,<br>
and to the Letterboxing Gods for allowing me to "run into" <br>
Aljan.  I enjoyed meeting all of you and wish I could<br>
have come to your Gathering for more fun.  I hope to <br>
meet more of you next time and get to know those that<br>
I met a little better.  Thanks again for your hospitality!<br>
<br>

P.S.  I placed 7 new boxes during the trip:  3 in CO, <br>
      3 in WY and 1 in UT, so enjoy.<br>
<br>
P.P.S.  The Rocky Mountain High box almost didn't get<br>
        placed since it was raining and cold that day, <br>
        but I was determined to get it up there and<br>
        notch another 14'er.<br>
