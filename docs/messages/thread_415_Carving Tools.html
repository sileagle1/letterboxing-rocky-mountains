A friend sent me a set of speedball tools, and I was so excited to <br/>
try them. But like you said, the nibs were kinda dull and I never <br/>
felt like I was in control of the cut, sooo, I'm back to my fine <br/>
little exacto blade, I forget what size it is, but I can do just <br/>
about anything with it, and it feels more precise for me, and they <br/>
actually have replacement blades here in Moab (what a miracle)!<br/>
