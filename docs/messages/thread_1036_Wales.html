probably not going to do much sightseeing this time around.  I'm going to be<br>
mostly in Cardiff.  I will get to go to the symphony one night.  I may get<br>
to go out to one national park that is nearby and I'll see some castles and<br>
museums, but I'm not getting out much in the countryside this time.  I hope<br>
to later.  I have chosen a horrible time of year to go.  It will probably be<br>
wet, grey, and raining the whole time, but that's okay.  I'm just happy to<br>
be there.  I can't wait!!!<br>
