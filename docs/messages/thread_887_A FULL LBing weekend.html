3 days - Friday, Saturday and Sunday<br/>
13 clues printed out and taken with<br/>

Highest Stamp:  WOTY-Yule beat Moffat Road by about 200 feet; both <br/>

Most Difficult Boxes to Retrieve and Return:  Two Track and <br/>
Commissioner Shooting due to a wedding at Point Park<br/>

I am also posting a photo of our surprise meeting with Front Range <br/>

up with Aljan, but didn't get a picture together.<br/>

the clues to my Grand Lake letterbox to include a way to<br/>
hike up from town if the Lodge is closed.  You can also<br/>
try parking on the road where it is blocked and hiking to <br/>
the main parking lot.  The Lodge is closed between Labor<br/>
Day and Memorial Day, but the box is accessible as long<br/>
as the trail is clear of snow.  It is so beatiful up<br/>
there I wish I could visit more often.  I envy ya'll!<br/>

Thanks for coming up and taking some of your LBing time to meet up with me!  It was a good time.  Love the moose stamp!  The festival in the park was a nice bonus.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry you had a bit of trouble with the Spirit Lake clues.  I will drive over and see if those tables may have been moved.  I will have to pick something more permanant as my starting point.  Glad that you were able to find it anyhow - that stamps is one of my favs.<br/>

How is the log for 'Yes' doing?  <br/>

Thanks again!  Glad that you enjoyed my little boxes.<br/>

I didn't count the remaining pages, but I'd say there are at least <br/>
half-a-dozen or so.  Unless there is a real stampede to get to that <br/>
box over the next few weeks, it should be OK.  Although, if those of <br/>
you reading this who haven't been to Jenny's knew what a great little <br/>
place it is, you would be stampeding to get there.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, while looking for inspiration for my next stamp, I happened <br/>
across a little work of art known as "Calavera de la Catrina" by Jose <br/>
Guadalupe Posada.  It looked quite familiar...<br/>

Oh yes, I would love to say that the calaveras was my own design, but it is not.  I have been really lazy lately, using a lot of other people's work as inspiration.  Hope you aren't calling plagiarism on me!!  It is very rare, first time in fact that I have used something so exactly.  It will certainly be recognized as someone else's artwork in the clues.<br/>

looking for something related to a stamp I want to carve, I found the <br/>
inspiration for a stamp you'd already carved.  If I'd seen that in a <br/>
different context, I'd have been too intimidated to try to carve it <br/>
myself.  Kudos to you for tackling it and doing such a great job!<br/>

&gt; Great, thanks.  Mmmmm, Jenny's, I could use a nice big burger today!<br/>

&gt; Oh yes, I would love to say that the calaveras was my own design, <br/>
but it is not.  I have been really lazy lately, using a lot of other <br/>
people's work as inspiration.  Hope you aren't calling plagiarism on <br/>
me!!  It is very rare, first time in fact that I have used something <br/>
so exactly.  It will certainly be recognized as someone else's artwork <br/>
in the clues.<br/>

<br/>
My friends and I had a great time following you around last Sunday - <br/>
we found your stamps from the day before on 5 LBs in the Grand Lake <br/>
area.  Your advice about the Grand Lake LB trail was very helpful.  <br/>
We would have been lost without the information.<br/>
<br/>
Now that we are back home, we are going to try to find some of The H-<br/>
A's LBs in Littleton.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Stamping!<br/>

&gt; The H-A's spent an outstanding weekend in Grand Lake and <br/>
recommended <br/>
&gt; it as a letterboxer's destination of choice.  Here is the final <br/>
&gt; tally:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3 days - Friday, Saturday and Sunday<br/>
&gt; 13 clues printed out and taken with<br/>
&gt; 12 boxes found (15 if you count 3 double boxes by Aljan Sundance)<br/>
&gt; 1 Hitchhiker left behind<br/>
&gt; 1 Hitchhiker picked up<br/>
&gt; 2 exchanges - one planned and one surprise meeting<br/>
&gt; 1 first find - our first, missed a second one by only a day<br/>
&gt; 29 new stamps in our logbook<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Highest Stamp:  WOTY-Yule beat Moffat Road by about 200 feet; both <br/>
&gt; are over 11,000 feet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Most Difficult Boxes to Retrieve and Return:  Two Track and <br/>
&gt; Commissioner Shooting due to a wedding at Point Park<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Toughest Drive:  Moffat Road, followed closely by None Other <br/>
Beeste.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box Requiring Most Determination:  Grand Lake Lodge due to the <br/>
lodge <br/>
&gt; being closed for the season and the entrance blockaded.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best Food Served While Stamping In:  Jenny's in Empire while <br/>
&gt; stamping into Yes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am also posting a photo of our surprise meeting with Front Range <br/>
&gt; Hiker and her crew at the Spirit Lake Letterbox.  Hopefully this <br/>
&gt; will encourage her to stop lurking and start posting.  We also met <br/>
&gt; up with Aljan, but didn't get a picture together.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was a great weekend, the weather was unbeatable and the aspen <br/>
&gt; were blazing.  If you haven't gotten up there yet, get moving!<br/>
