boxes in the same area, I thought I would pose this question here. <br>
<br>
<br>
Often when reviewing clues I see the mention of other letterboxes in the<br>
general vicinity.  For example, "Don't forget to bring the clues for<br>
..." or "same starting point as...".<br>
<br>
Do placers ask permission before including the names of other boxes?<br>
And if not, do placers of the mentioned letterboxes seem to mind when<br>
they find out?<br>

      I did mention a nearby geocache in my last clue but I just <br>
stumbled across that. Any letterboxer would find that anyway. I agree <br>
with Silver Eagle in that secretive or even "harder" clues are easy <br>
to tell from the straightforward clues. And I also agree that most <br>
people with easier clues would appreciate the added traffic at their <br>
box.<br>
     I had an idea for a box where the clue would be based on the <br>
location of other boxes. "North of such and such, west of such and <br>
such." So the other boxes would have to be located first. But I also <br>
worried about mentioning someone elses box in my clue. If I do that I <br>
think I will ask permission first. Just a courtesy really. To avoid <br>
the surprise of reading about ones own box in someone else's clue.<br>
     For the really hard clues, I would ask permission to even talk <br>
about them. If I solved A Bard's Tale (in my dreams, right?) I would <br>
ask mapsurfer before I announced it on a list. Sometimes the author <br>
might want to keep EVERYTHING secret about a box, even whether or not <br>
it has been found.<br>
