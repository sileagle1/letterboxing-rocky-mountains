11/17/2007 - Box Replanted<br/>
<br/>
This box is placed in honor of the "Going Fishing for LetterboxeRs in <br/>
Idaho" Gathering July 10, 2005. This is one non traditional Fishy <br/>
Box. Hope you have fun finding it! <br/>
<br/>
Starting Point: Merrill Park 637 E. Shore Dr., Eagle, ID <br/>
<br/>
Clues: From the large shelter walk past the playground (on your <br/>
right ) and small shelter (on your right) on your way to the river <br/>
(south). You will cross a bridge and come to a sign carved into a <br/>
large boulder that says "Eagle Pathway System  City of Eagle 2004." <br/>
<br/>
Take the paved path to your right and follow past mile marker NW 9.9. <br/>
continue down the paved path and you will eventually come to a path <br/>
on your left about 18 steps or 9 paces BEFORE mile marker NW10.0. If <br/>
you come to the mile marker first just backtrack the paces or steps. <br/>
The path is located east of the mile marker. Follow the trail towards <br/>
the river (south) approximately 66 steps or 33 paces until you reach <br/>
a "Y" in the path. We noticed some hay bails and twigs in the way.  <br/>
Just go around and continue your hunt once you reach the path.  Take <br/>
the path to your right (west) another 74 steps or 37 paces. <br/>
<br/>
You will now be at two logs on the ground along the path on your <br/>
left. Starting at the beginning of the largest log take 10 steps or 5 <br/>
paces and you will be at a break in the large log. <br/>
<br/>
Hidden at the bottom of the crack under some bark and rocks you will <br/>
find the "GoldFish" Letterbox hiding. <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your visit to the Eagle Pathway System and Merrill Park. Please <br/>
re-hide the box carefully as this is an active path. Should you note <br/>
the box missing, it's contents in bad repair or if you just want to <br/>
say "hi" please contace me at Blackvelvetrav@yahoo.com. Happy hunting!<br/>
