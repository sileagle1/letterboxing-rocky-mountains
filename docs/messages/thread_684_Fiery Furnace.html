LOVED all the boxes in the Moab area because the area is so remarkable <br/>

I'm sorry to hear you're moving out of our area.  We will all just <br/>
have to do the Phoenix boxes next winter!<br/>

there, but don't want to cause problems.<br/>
<br/>
Kat,  it is looking more and more like we may be moving to Sunseeker's <br/>
area and you bet your life we can add some more LBs down there. <br/>
(First,  I had to look to see how far Phoenix was from Moab before I <br/>
put in my vote for the move!!! Not much different - so that's OK)  I <br/>
am very concerned about the heat in Phoenix - because I like to be <br/>
outdoors.  How do you guys handle the summer heat in areas like Moab <br/>
and Phoenix?  It scares me.  I saw a little crystal filled neck rag at <br/>
REI that you wear - do you think that will help? <br/>
