plenty left in case anyone is taking advantage of the recent much <br>
colder weather and making boxes galore (as I am - got 6+ boxes ready <br>
to plant....snort )<br>
<br>
I am happy to report a school in the Salt Lake City, UT area did a <br>
fun Valentines project with 50 of these boxes 'cause I hooked up a <br>
teacher there with freebies.<br>
<br>
Contact me off list if you're interested in free Altoid boxes in ANY <br>
amount.<br>
<br>
No mowing of lawns, with or without snow on top, required - nor are <br>
Three Stooges puns.  <grins><br>

pre - who has noticed the daylight hours are getting longer, and the <br>
wittle birdies every morning are starting to make it sound a lot <br>
like spring in Denver.  Bring on Boxing Season!<br>
