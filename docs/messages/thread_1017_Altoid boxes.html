plenty left in case anyone is taking advantage of the recent much <br/>
colder weather and making boxes galore (as I am - got 6+ boxes ready <br/>
to plant....snort )<br/>
<br/>
I am happy to report a school in the Salt Lake City, UT area did a <br/>
fun Valentines project with 50 of these boxes 'cause I hooked up a <br/>
teacher there with freebies.<br/>
<br/>
Contact me off list if you're interested in free Altoid boxes in ANY <br/>
amount.<br/>
<br/>
No mowing of lawns, with or without snow on top, required - nor are <br/>
Three Stooges puns.  <grins><br/>
<br/>
pre - who has noticed the daylight hours are getting longer, and the <br/>
wittle birdies every morning are starting to make it sound a lot <br/>
like spring in Denver.  Bring on Boxing Season!<br/>

&gt; Ok Folks, I'm not kidding this time.  Someone at work just gave me <br/>
an <br/>
&gt; entire paper box full of Altoid boxes - over 100 of them!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I now challenge the entire Rocky Mountain Letterboxing planet (and <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; kids' chronically underfunded art classes, or anyone else you <br/>
think can <br/>
&gt; use them) to take some of them off my hands.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let's have a mini box extravaganza! PLEASE!  I hated to say no to <br/>
them, <br/>
&gt; but I really don't have the space to store them.  I can confirm <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; they work great as magnetic boxes with 2 small strong magnets from <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; hardware store affixed to the back.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Contact me on or off list for how best to get them to you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; On a similar note, but different kind of box - yesterday at work <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; &gt; asked folks if they had any small metal boxes (like <br/>
&gt; &gt; Altoid/Bandaid) 'cause I have plans for some micro boxes.  I <br/>
expected <br/>
&gt; 5 <br/>
&gt; &gt; or so.  Imagine my surprise when I came into find an entire bag <br/>
on my <br/>
&gt; &gt; desk!  And this is only the day after I asked.  I'm now <br/>
expecting <br/>
&gt; I'll <br/>
&gt; &gt; probably get inundated.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If any boxers can use some of these (I got a lot of Altoid <br/>
boxes) <br/>
&gt; &gt; please let me know. I'd hate to just transfer them from the <br/>
storage <br/>
&gt; &gt; places of my colleagues to my own. Rather see them used for LBs!<br/>
