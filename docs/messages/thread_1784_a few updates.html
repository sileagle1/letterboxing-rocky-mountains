Just so you know, beginning with this season it's a permanent box and with a permanent stamp.  I won't be changing out the image with each year anymore.  Checked up on this box yesterday and the small logbook is close, but not quite full. I'd apPREciate knowing when it's down to space for only 1-2 more stamps and I'll replace the book.<br/>
<br/>
Denver Skatepark was pulled for maintenace a few months ago.  It now has a new box and logbook and is ready for finders.  We'll see if it stays dry this time.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, please remember that Paying Attention actually doesn't cost a dime...<br/>
