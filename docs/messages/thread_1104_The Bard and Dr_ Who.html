                    <div class="plaintext-content">okay, so I did the Doctor Who episode for my fiance and he now has to go<br>
letterboxing with me.  (ha, ha, ha) The only problem being I am now hooked<br>
to Dr. Who and was ticked off this weekend b/c I thought I would get to see<br>
the beginning of the season finale, but Sci Fi Network didn't show it this<br>
week.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm getting off-course.  He is now committed to go letterboxing at<br>
least once with me.  I've decided that I will carve him a killer stamp of,<br>
what else, the Bard!  You see, my sweetheart's last name is Shakespeare.<br>
How cool is that?  I think it ought to make for a pretty cool signature<br>
stamp.  Now to find the right image . . .<br>
