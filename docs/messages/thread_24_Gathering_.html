I think Dixie may have suggested a good thing!  Roxborough State Park <br/>
has two letterboxes (which, as you all know, is a lot for our area) - <br/>
and also would be a great spot to gather!   Checking the poll - it <br/>
looks like very few of us have gone up to get these boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Shall we plan something for that park?  It's in the southern end of <br/>
Denver area - so folks driving from C. Springs won't have to go quite <br/>
so far! <br/>
<br/>
Now the next thing would be to choose a weekend/Saturday that would <br/>
work for all.  Cadenza ... what's the liklihood of a trip to <br/>
Colorado??  :)<br/>
<br/>
This will be a great opportunity to exchange, hunt for the boxes in <br/>
RSP, perhaps plant some more?  - Maybe someone could demonstrate some <br/>
rubber stamp carving techniques, etc.  Dixie can share her bear <br/>
story ...  :)  There are lots of ideas.  Potluck picnic, of course!<br/>
<br/>
I'll post a new poll with some suggested weekends.  Check off which <br/>
dates are GOOD and we'll try to schedule at a time when things are <br/>
the most accessable for everyone.<br/>

&gt; I wanted to tell you all that more of you need to find the 2 in <br/>
&gt; Roxbourough State Park.  The Fountain Valley one is very easy, but, <br/>
&gt; they're both fun with BEAUTIFUL views of the red rock formations!  <br/>
I promise you, you won't regret it!  Fountain Valley was our first <br/>
one and we actually saw a mother and baby black bear!  YIKES!  It's <br/>
&gt; quite the story for our first LB hunt!<br/>
