Okay, I figured everyone would approve, so check out the pics!  I have <br/>
more, but I didn't want to use up all the allowed space.  When you all <br/>
have pictures ready to post, feel free to delete any of mine to make <br/>
room for more!<br/>
<br/>
Y-nought....we got 8 first finders! YOWWIE!  We are excited!  We were <br/>
just ahead of Ravenwolf and her group and running into ABear was so <br/>
COOL!  We loved the Portal Hike and really, really, recommend Negro <br/>
Bill's Canyon to those who will be going back...it's beautiful!  We <br/>
picked up a couple boxes as we left Monday including ES's Dewey <br/>
bridge, which we LOVE your stamp, ES!  Right after leaving there, we <br/>
spotted a group of turkey vultures sunning on some rancher's post.  <br/>
They were beautiful, if somewhat "vultury"!  Then a cow was on the <br/>
road, and we felt like we were being stopped from leaving this <br/>
wonderful adventure!  I snapped a picture of the cow....too funny!<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think of the pics!<br/>

Oh no, Ramdelt, what's a letterboxer to do??? Actually, we arrived <br/>
Friday afternoon about the same time as Ravenwolf's group did.  It <br/>
seems we were just ahead of them on many of the boxes.  We do feel a <br/>
bit sheepish about being first finders on so many...WHO KNEW???  <br/>
Although, 4 of our first finders were because we did the Portal <br/>
Trail hike which had 4 new boxes on the same trail and that wasn't <br/>
until Saturday morning!  It was quite a hike and feel we definitely <br/>
worked to earn them!  2 were at Dead Horse Point when we ran into <br/>
the placers, Saturday afternoon!  GADS!  So, actually, it isn't as <br/>
bad as it appears, it's not like we were racing around Moab Friday!  <br/>
Our first finds were on 2 trails that we did on Saturday, when most <br/>
of you were there!  So, don't be too hard on me!  And, there were 11 <br/>
more boxes we found that we weren't the first finders.  And, many, <br/>
many more boxes that we didn't have time for.  So, Ramdelt, <br/>
please,please go easy on me....how about some pie to make things <br/>
better?!<br/>
