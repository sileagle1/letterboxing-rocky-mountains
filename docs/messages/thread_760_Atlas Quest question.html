Access to premium member-only letterboxes and clues<br>

Is anyone listing some boxes for premium members only?  It certainly<br>
could provide boxes with a little more safety, but also fewer visitors.<br>

you were searching for boxes in Parker, they'd appear.  You can tell <br>
that they're premium because the little Robin Hood hat appears at the <br>
top of the clue. <br>
<br>
There is also a board that is only accessable by premium members but <br>
it's mostly just chatting. :)<br>

I will have some clues posted here in the next week or so that will be <br>
limited.  They may end up just being word of mouth, but if I do decide <br>
to post them they'll only be in the premium area of Atlas Quest.  <br>
