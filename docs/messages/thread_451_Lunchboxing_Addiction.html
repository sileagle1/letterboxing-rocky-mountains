Says JeLyBean's colleagues: "Hey JeLyBean, we're all going out to <br/>
this place for lunch, want to go? - they're supposed to have better <br/>
crab cakes than God can get in Heaven."<br/>

One hour later...<br/>
<br/>
Says JeLyBean's colleagues, "Wow, you really missed it J-Man, those <br/>
crab cakes were so good I almost passed out."<br/>
<br/>
Says JeLyBean around his mouthful of quarter pounder with <br/>
cheese, "Bummer..."<br/>

Thinks JeLyBean, ...but then again, none of you suckers added 2 to <br/>
