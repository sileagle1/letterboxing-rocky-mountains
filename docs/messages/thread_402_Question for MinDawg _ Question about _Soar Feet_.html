1)Mindawg, kinda OT, since it's about geocaching but, why does your<br/>
new cache - Yearling - show up as "temporarily unavailable"? Is it<br/>
waiting for OS approval or has it already gone missing? I was thinking<br/>
I'd go get it tomorrow while I'm out there if it really is still<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
2) Does anyone know if the "Soar Feet" box has been pulled yet? If not<br/>
I'll grab it too while I'm out there.<br/>

I expect a ranger would just pull the box, not write a nasty note and<br/>
take the stamp. Probably some muggle found it by accident.<br/>
Also, the only time you have to get a permit from Jefferson County is<br/>
if the box is in one of their Open Space Parks. Otherwise they don't<br/>
have any authority. If it's in a CO State Park, the current policy is<br/>
to verbally clear it with the local ranger when placing it - no need<br/>
to go through any state bureaucracy.<br/>

Most are very nice, but occasionally you get an overzealous one.  I am a <br/>
volunteer at the South Platte Park and help with the school programs.<br/>
