I know people are busy, but I, for one, am always in the mood for a <br/>
long rambling message from the members of this group.<br/>

to while away the hours for a special Y guy who was unable to attend <br/>
the "largest yet" gathering of the Rocky Mtn. Letterboxers of <br/>
America (hey, where's our patch?  But, that's another story...)<br/>
<br/>
So, dedicated to you, Y Guy! We missed you and all the <br/>
other "crazed" boxers who were unable to attend!  Here it goes!<br/>
<br/>
It was a dark and stormy nighterrrdark night!  The lone fireman <br/>
added more wood to the fire in his fire pit hoping to chase away any <br/>
unseen hobgoblins and protect his invited guests from the local <br/>
moose.  Everyone new of the crazed moose that struck down the poor <br/>
town elder in Main street in the center of townhe didn't want this <br/>
for his guests in his own back yard!  <br/>
<br/>
Back to the fireit was a huge pit that the fireman and his <br/>
beautiful lady, Aljan had put in recently to warm the nights and add <br/>
the ambiance for tales, such as this!  The wonderful deck off the <br/>
back of the house added views into the thick pine forest, and, kept <br/>
the moose at bay!<br/>
<br/>
But suddenly, from the quiet of the night, a sound was heard<br/>
munching!  On the edge of the forest, not far from the fire, was the <br/>
munching Moose and friend!  YOW!  They were formidable and not to be <br/>
messed with!  Cappy shone his light for all to see the awesome power <br/>
of the crazed beings!  The fireman was of a fearsome heritage and <br/>
lead a party into the brush to check on his opponent.  There, <br/>
nestled down (can crazed moose nestle?) amongst the grass and <br/>
needles of the forest floor, settling in for the night.  For, even <br/>
the crazed moose knew of the warmth that the fireman brought to them <br/>
on special nights and the wafting of somemores was like sugarplums <br/>
dancing in their heads!<br/>
<br/>
Somemores!  YUM!  The kids then turned crazed!  It was too much fun <br/>
poking those marshmallows into the fire and then with Aljan's <br/>
special touch of graham crackers and Peach's favchocolatethey <br/>
yummed down their tasty treats!  <br/>
<br/>
As the moon shone thru the pines, and the crazed moose snored away, <br/>
a few of the grand, grand, gatherers went their wayfor tomorrow was <br/>
the day for all to meet and exchange stamps and stories!  <br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned, for part 2 of Peach's story!<br/>
<br/>
