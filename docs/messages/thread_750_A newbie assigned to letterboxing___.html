Hi!  My name's Katie and I work at the Plains Conservation Center in <br/>
Aurora, CO.  I've recently been assigned to revamp the letterboxing <br/>
program we have here, and I need a little help.  Basically, we have <br/>
three different letterboxing trails: one involving the general <br/>
prairie, one in an 1887-replica sod village, and one in an 1837-<br/>
replica Cheyenne Indian camp.  I have a few basic questions-I know <br/>
they might sound stupid-is this like a scavenger hunt type thing where <br/>
you leave clues at every landmark?  Do you write a story involving the <br/>
trail or do you just write stuff like "take 20 paces to the east"?  <br/>
Any help would be appreciated-our program is severely lacking!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Katie<br/>
