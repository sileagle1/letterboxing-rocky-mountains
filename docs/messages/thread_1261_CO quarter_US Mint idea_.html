Wondering if her carving skills are up to what would have to be a <br>
SMALL, maybe even real life size, to pull off the hiding spot that <br>
would be necessary....but looking for ideas to work on all this crap <br>
weather...STILL and willing to try if no one wants to...<br>

I suggested the CO quarter half of the idea, but I<br>
don't have plans (either short term or long term) to<br>
do it.  As far as I'm concerned, feel free!<br>
