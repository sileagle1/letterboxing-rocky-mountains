where you start for the Yule Box. <br>
    I thought about placing one on a 14,000 + foot peak, but last <br>
time I was on top of Handies Peak there was about fifty people up <br>
there. I don't think one would last very long with that kind of <br>
traffic. Plus, when people climb those peaks the first thing they do <br>
is start poking around for a register to sign into. <br>
    Placing one on a more obscure high peak would have the opposite <br>
problem, no visitors. <br>
    That is a fun question and it makes me wonder about Pikes Peak or <br>
Mount Evans. Or California. Alaska?<br>

If so, he doesn't give an elevation but says he thinks this box may <br>
be the furthest from the center of the earth, which normally I would <br>
think would indicate a pretty high altitude, had this statement not <br>
come from Mapsurfer.<br>

Oh, yeah, that's our boy! Thanks for finding that and giving me my <br>
best smile of the day. He does play the game, doesn't he? He's one of <br>
the few that really "get it." At a recent small gathering, there was <br>
a one-day box planted about 100 yards away from the picnic tables, <br>
and people would bunch up together in raucous gaggles to go find it. <br>
I happened to catch him sneaking off to hunt and sign in the old <br>
fashioned way, furtively and in secrecy. One of our more enthusiastic <br>
boxers was constantly picking his brain with absolutely NO result: he <br>
wasn't rude at all but was masterful in redirecting. Randy is a <br>
brilliant purist who raises the bar for everyone. Wish he was a more <br>
frequent poster to the big list. Again, thanks for making my day! <br>
Jay, solidly at sea level.<br>
