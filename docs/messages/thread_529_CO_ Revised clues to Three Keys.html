Hello-<br>
    I heard that my local library was going to move some of their <br>
reference material to another building. And the book needed to solve <br>
the original clues to Three Keys is part of that move. So I wrote <br>
some new clues that don't rely on them having that particular book. <br>
<br>
If anyone tries to find it with the old clues, they may still work <br>
for a while. But the best bet will be with the new version.<br>
