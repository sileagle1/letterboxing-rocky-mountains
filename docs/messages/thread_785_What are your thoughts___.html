In other news...boxing last weekend in Wyoming was great!  We found <br>

Another recent trip led us to the honeywine plunder.  No Y-nought, I <br>

Grand Lake plundered the stash before I could get there.  I think <br>
there may be an inside conspiracy since Catamount Carvers were in <br>
Grand Lake to get all of the loot up there near the same time.  <br>
Seeing this empty chest, I felt bad and left my breakfast inside for <br>

Cadenza, I understand where you are coming from.  Did you happen to see the part I had written about the placer being required to authorize the posting?  I think that letterboxing in Idaho and Colorado are slightly different in the number of boxes and the number of letterboxers as well.  If I had a box posted as missing, it would give me incentive to check it, replace it or retire it sooner.  If I had driven hundreds of miles and hiked in to find a box that was missing and later found that the placer knew it was missing, I'd be upset and would think twice about searching for another of their boxes in risk of the same result.  What about those boxes that were on websites that are no longer active yet the boxes are still out there (Eogan's Stashes)?  What if a letterboxer goes unheard from and their boxes never are maintained?  How many times do we hear from someone that wants to travel to an area and is wondering if the boxes are still active?  I personally would want to be conscientious to my letterboxing friends efforts and time.  I guess one of the main reasons for my thought was the recent list of placers that came out on this talk group and said that their boxes were missing with or without a replacement plan.  If a placer is willing to come out and say that their box is missing, wouldn't a list be a good thing?  Then when it's replaced it would be removed?  This issue really isn't that big of a deal to me, I just think we need to be more open minded and think more about others time and efforts.  Whether this is the solution, I'm not sure, but communication and new ideas are what will make Letterboxing better for everyone.<br>

I have a box that is fairly regularly reported missing.  Again, I'd hate for <br>

And no, Cadenza - your post was not harsh.  It was totally appropriate.  We <br>
dont want to do anything on this list that will cause turmoil.  I started <br>
this list because I wanted OFF of the big list, and all the drama there. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, it seems that there is some consensus that as long as the placer is involved, if possible, that a database on this site would be okay to atleast try out.  Therefore, with the assistance of Autumn we will test it out.  If there is anyone out there that would like to list any boxes that are missing or need attention let me know and we will add it to the initial list.  If you are not the placer, I will be emailing the placer to confirm and get the okay to list it.  If you have any questions, please let me know.<br>

I agree.  If only the placers were putting up notices such as "reported <br>
missing, I'll be checking it soon" or "pulled for maintenance" etc.  I guess <br>
we would simply have to trust that only the placers are making notes about <br>
their boxes - or had authorized the note, perhaps something we could verify <br>
with an email.  We could have a place to say who posted the notice - <br>
something along the lines of Autumn, placer  or ... Autumn, on behalf of <br>
Ramdelt.<br>
<br>
I have a box that is fairly regularly reported missing.  Again, I'd hate for <br>
someone to miss out on it because of a note on a database.  However, if I <br>
put the note there myself - that's a whole different story.  Participation <br>
would be totally voluntary by the placers in this case. Thoughts?<br>
<br>
And no, Cadenza - your post was not harsh.  It was totally appropriate.  We <br>
dont want to do anything on this list that will cause turmoil.  I started <br>
this list because I wanted OFF of the big list, and all the drama there. <br>
Now, I dont get drama - just pirates and pie!  A much nicer situation all <br>
around.<br>

(who hates searching for boxes that have gone missing and I didn't print a <br>
fresh clue sheet)<br>
(which I realize is my own fault)<br>
(suddenly craving pie ... again)<br>
