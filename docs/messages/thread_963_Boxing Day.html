Proud to announce I've PREsurpassed F60...can 100 be far behind?<br>

Anyway, DABD....Day After Boxing Day...I'm pleased to announced I've <br>
placed A Road-Side Incident ...on LbNA...my P3.<br>
<br>
...in Boulder with a First Finder ...smile....and a >>>PRErequest to <br>
that person!<<<<br>
<br>
I was up that way doing errands.......one late in the day was <br>
finding Fador Glava.... <grins> what an inspiring box!<br>
<br>
and ran out of daylight finding a place to plant my Boulder-Centric <br>
box.  I am blonde and dork.  I wasn't sure on what date I'd actually <br>
be able to place this box...so I left a space blank on my first page <br>
in this box!  Which, of course! I forgot to fill in once I'd found a <br>
place to put it!<br>
<br>
Would the first finder mind entering in to my space provided (on the <br>
first page along with stamp sample) the date "12/27/2005"?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
Oh, and I'm 80+% of the way done with getting ready to place <br>
GME. ..Another Denver Mystery(ish) box some time VERY soon.  If I  <br>
possibly can before my paid break from work is done.....Look for it <br>
soon, too. I Hope...<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I also celebrate boxing day.  One year I released my first postal letterbox<br>
on Boxing Day too for the silliness of the pun.  I was going to do some this<br>
year(since this warm front melted all our snow!!!), but we were hammered<br>
with rain and sleet and I was feeling the beginning of a cold to begin with,<br>
so I stopped.<br>
