                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wonder how many of you put a backing, like a piece of wood, on <br>
the back of the stamps you carve and do you just glue it on?  I've <br>

used Elmer's carpenter's (or wood) glue to attach them.  I've seen <br>
some interesting hunks of wood attached to some stamps and was just <br>

Personally though, I've stopped backing mine.  They stamp fine without it.<br>
Sometimes they stamp better without as you can control the surface area.  We<br>
can do our best to control the elements, but we can't control other<br>
letterboxers or animals and how exposed they leave our precious bundles.<br>
Water, snow, etc will eventually get into the best of boxes and can warp the<br>

If you research on the big list and various other places, you will find that<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For the most part I don't put backings on the majority of my own <br>
stamps - most (especially my urban boxes) are small enough it just <br>
doesn't matter and only gets in the way of some cramped box space.  <br>
Slowly, however, I'm starting to work with larger and larger images, <br>
and for those I DO put backings on the stamps - both 'cause it helps <br>
make it easier to stamp in, and because I can continue my design theme <br>
with the backing.<br>
<br>
If it helps, since I know some of the H-As stamps are also PREtty big, <br>
it really helps me stamping in when larger stamps have backings (say <br>
like Enginerd, for example)which imho would have been almost impossible <br>
to get into my book w/o messing it up and having to restamp.<br>
<br>
I don't have enough experience yet to see how different kinds of glue <br>
hold up long-term, and would be interested in knowing from other <br>
posters what they use to affix the stamp to backing, when backings are <br>
used.<br>

both lightly done sides dry or if it was just glued on and allowed to dry?<br>
I'm really curious.  I've never heard that comment.  I'll try to keep that<br>

I use Krazy Glue - the brush-on kind, and it seems to work OK.  I've <br>
been doing this for about four years now and have never had a report <br>
of a damaged backing, seperated stamp, or shattered glue, and I used <br>
to live in NY where it gets pretty fargin' COLD in the winter.<br>

The warm weather certainly does effect materials.  We've seen one<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I back my stamps onto either 1/4 inch plexiglass (you can pick it up <br>
for cheap at any hardware store) or 1/2 inch foam core, believe it or <br>
not. Either medium seems to stand up to both the cold, and the heat. I <br>
haven't had very good luck with rubber cement either. Seems to just <br>
turn into goo if it gets too hot. I had our personal stamps mounted <br>
onto plexiglass with rubber cement, and then left them in the car on a <br>
hot day - they slid right off!<br>
<br>
But it's a pretty personal thing. We have seen stamps backed on <br>
everything from Es's marble, to wood, to the tops of mason jars!<br>
