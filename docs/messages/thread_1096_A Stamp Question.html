                    <div class="plaintext-content">For the most part I don't put backings on the majority of my own <br/>
stamps - most (especially my urban boxes) are small enough it just <br/>
doesn't matter and only gets in the way of some cramped box space.  <br/>
Slowly, however, I'm starting to work with larger and larger images, <br/>
and for those I DO put backings on the stamps - both 'cause it helps <br/>
make it easier to stamp in, and because I can continue my design theme <br/>
with the backing.<br/>
<br/>
If it helps, since I know some of the H-As stamps are also PREtty big, <br/>
it really helps me stamping in when larger stamps have backings (say <br/>
like Enginerd, for example)which imho would have been almost impossible <br/>
to get into my book w/o messing it up and having to restamp.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have enough experience yet to see how different kinds of glue <br/>
hold up long-term, and would be interested in knowing from other <br/>
posters what they use to affix the stamp to backing, when backings are <br/>
used.<br/>

I use Krazy Glue - the brush-on kind, and it seems to work OK.  I've <br/>

stuff.  It was planted out on our property, as a surprise for our sons. <br/>
It would have been summer and we can hit 100 degrees here and there.  The<br/>
glue certainly had been cured and then re-liquified and made a big mess. <br/>
The warm weather certainly does effect materials.  We've seen one<br/>
decomposing plastic letterbox in Arizona.  This even happens here in<br/>
Colorado, esp. if the box isn't covered well and it is exposed to the<br/>
sun.<br/>

&gt; that is so fascinating!!  I've never heard of that at all!  Where was <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; stamp planted?  Do you know if it was done like I talked about with <br/>
&gt; letting<br/>
&gt; both lightly done sides dry or if it was just glued on and allowed <br/>
&gt; to dry?<br/>
&gt; I'm really curious.  I've never heard that comment.  I'll try to <br/>
&gt; keep that<br/>
&gt; in mind if I do a stamp in a warmer spot.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yoque backed a stamp with rubber cement and it melted and got <br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; &gt; gross.  That stamp is in the "repair shop."  We have backed two <br/>
&gt; other<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamps with leather.  They match the journal leather and we found <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; the leather is pliable enough to not have issues with getting a <br/>
&gt; good<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp image.  Of course, the leather could attract mold and that <br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; definitely reduce the life of the box.  I think we used Goop as <br/>
&gt; the glue<br/>
&gt; &gt; for that.  We assume not back our stamps at this point unless it <br/>
&gt; totally<br/>
&gt; &gt; adds to the box ... like all the cool backings found on some of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Esmerelda's boxes ... coal, marble, etc.<br/>

for cheap at any hardware store) or 1/2 inch foam core, believe it or <br/>
not. Either medium seems to stand up to both the cold, and the heat. I <br/>
haven't had very good luck with rubber cement either. Seems to just <br/>
turn into goo if it gets too hot. I had our personal stamps mounted <br/>
onto plexiglass with rubber cement, and then left them in the car on a <br/>
hot day - they slid right off!<br/>
<br/>
But it's a pretty personal thing. We have seen stamps backed on <br/>
everything from Es's marble, to wood, to the tops of mason jars!<br/>
