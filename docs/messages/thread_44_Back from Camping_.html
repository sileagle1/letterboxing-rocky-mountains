                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey all!  Just back from my camping trip.  It was lovely indeed to <br/>
meet up with Ewok and Trinity Jah and their friend Arianna.  Fiona <br/>
and I have known each other forever!  :)  Lovely to exchange stamps <br/>
and meet friendly faces!<br/>
<br/>
The hike to Abert's Squirrel involves a CLIMB.  I thought I'd mention <br/>
that because it isn't really evident in the clues how much vertical <br/>
you'll be doing, but its not hard, and the box and stamps are just <br/>
lovely!!<br/>
<br/>
What a bonus to find a HH!  A happy dance from all of us.  (wonder if <br/>
the wildlife knew why five women were squealing with delight?)<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile ... I'll give the list an early heads up.  I planted <br/>
another box in the same area.  Not on that same trail, but it's also <br/>
up Park County Road 68.  I was so tired by the time I planted the <br/>
box, that this one will be an easier find than Abert's Squirrel.  <br/>
Look for clues being posted soon.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
