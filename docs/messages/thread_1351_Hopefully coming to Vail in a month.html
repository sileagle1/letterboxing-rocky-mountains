<br>
There's a chance my husband's company may be footing the cost to fly<br>
all four of us out to Vail for some meetings at the end of July.<br>
Nothing's confirmed, and I have no idea what lodging or vehicle<br>
accommodations will be, but I'm wondering which boxes I shouldn't<br>
miss, given the chance. Remember I'll have two boys (4yo and 7yo) with<br>
me, so they need to be kid-friendly and short, easy,<br>
don't-get-us-lost-on-a-mountainside hikes. And if anyone wants to<br>
drive out to Vail for an exchange, let me know! :)<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

  Hope the trip works out for you!<br>
