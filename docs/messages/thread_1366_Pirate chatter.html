in, hopefully, a safer more muggle proof hidee hole.  Rattlesnake-less. <br/>
<br/>
Second, sounds like the mini-meet was a hoot and I'm sorry I didn't get <br/>
to play!  Although there is a possible meet up with the esteemed <br/>
visitors in store for the Buccaneers tomorrow.  And, really, you have <br/>
no idea what kind of a snake phobia this pirate has.  I would have <br/>
needed therapy.  And a whole lotta pie.  Just sayin'.<br/>
<br/>
Third, I think Buffalo Bill has had more visitors now than all my other <br/>
boxes combined!  I finally put a note in the clues about the fallen <br/>
sign.  Next time I'm over there I'll either rewrite the clues or <br/>
replant the sign.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, if you are interested in photos of the Nought wedding of the <br/>
year, I'll send you a link.  They had really good cake.  <br/>
<br/>
Fifth, I am the pirate queen.  GARRRRRRRRRRR!<br/>
<br/>
Es, doing an intricate pirate queen jig with lots of little kicks in it<br/>
