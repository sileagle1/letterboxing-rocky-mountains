                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am spending this month doing maintenance on my contributions to the <br/>
Lariat Loop series.  I'm adding a second stamp to each box, now that my <br/>
carving skills are a little better than they were in winter 2007.  <br/>
Hopefully these second stamps will inspire new carvers to keep <br/>
practicing ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The Yellow box was missing, so I have replanted it in a nearby tree <br/>
stump.  Please make sure you reprint clues before attempting the yellow <br/>
box.  I recarved the original image and added a second one to this box.<br/>
<br/>
To see which boxes have new stamps, look for a "found date" of February <br/>
2009 on Atlas Quest.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>
