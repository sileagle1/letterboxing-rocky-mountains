After the gathering, I went over to Chatfield to check up on Beltane <br>
and Ostara (Wheel of the Year boxes).  The Ostara box was in great <br>
shape, exactly in place.  <br>
 <br>
   HOWEVER<br>
 <br>
The Beltane Box is missing its logbook.  And wouldn't you know - I <br>
didn't have a blank book with me. *bonk*<br>
 <br>
I am hoping that perhaps Lisa (TDG) might have the log?  I know you <br>
were out there on the 20th - was the log there then?  I am baffled as <br>
to where it might have gone.  I looked all around the trail nearby <br>
for signs of it, but nothing.  The box was right where it should be, <br>
too.  <br>
