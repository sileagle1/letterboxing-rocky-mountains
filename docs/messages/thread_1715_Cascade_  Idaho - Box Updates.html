                    <div class="plaintext-content">This past weekend we were camping in Cascade, Idaho and I stopped to check on some of my existing boxes.  I am still finding a very disturbing trend of my boxes being left completely out in the open.  Many that I checked on were sitting next to their hiding spots without being covered and one naturally did not survive.  All I could find was the lid.  I am not sure who is being so careless and many of the finders are not officially logging in their finds on Letterboxing.org or Atlasquest.com so I am left to wonder who can't take a matter of minutes to carefully re-hide these boxes.  UGH!  Here are my updates:<br>
