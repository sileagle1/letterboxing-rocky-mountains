                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would suggest picking up a Speedball linoleum cutting set - if you <br/>
haven't already.<br/>
<br/>
At Hobby Lobby, you can find it over by the art supplies (markers, <br/>
colored pencils, etc.) There are several different cutting edges you <br/>
can get. That is how I do all of my stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Also, any images I like, I either draw directly in a program like <br/>
paint, or Adobe on the computer, or I draw my picture on paper, then <br/>
scan it into the computer. I can then print it, and using nail polish <br/>
remover (acetone), you can transfer the image onto the pink stuff. <br/>
That gives you a better idea of where and how you want to cut out <br/>
your stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>
