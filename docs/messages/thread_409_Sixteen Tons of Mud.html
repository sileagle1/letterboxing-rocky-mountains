Is it just me, or does the sun only shine when we aren't <br>
letterboxing. This sure has been a wet, wet fall. <br>
<br>
I can just picture that trail up to Sixteen Ton when it's wet. Good <br>
times, huh?<br>
<br>
y-nought (thankful for so many laughs on this list tonight)<br>

I can't believe you were here today, Kat!!  I almost went up to <br>
check on 16-ton.. but decided it was too muddy!! LOL  That has to be <br>
quite a climb in the rain!  I was down by the river on a nice mostly <br>
dry trail sitting comfortably on a log while you all were valiantly <br>
doing the mud tango. <br>
<br>
And, y'all need to know that NO one rehides a box like Kat does.  <br>
She told me that she'd put some extra rocks on 'Big Fish' last time <br>
she was here because it wasn't very well covered.. when I walked up <br>
I just wooted out loud.. there was a boulder the size of a cocker <br>
spaniel on the top of the cairn!  I grinned all day thinking about <br>
Kat lugging that over there to make sure that box was well hidden!  <br>
Now THAT is a considerate and thoughtful boxer!  A grateful pirate <br>
hug comin' your way, Kat. <br>
<br>
Y, you're taking the whole onion deal better than I am.  It just <br>
makes me make the scary face thinking about evil space ranger <br>
tossing that away.  What.. it was taking up too much room in the <br>
office?!  It was tiny!!  And you've been calling them ever since <br>
they dug it up!  Maybe we need to leave messages to the rangers on <br>
the boxes. <br>
<br>
Esmerelda, who can't stop singing '16 ton' now.  <br>
