Is it just me, or does the sun only shine when we aren't <br/>
letterboxing. This sure has been a wet, wet fall. <br/>
<br/>
I can just picture that trail up to Sixteen Ton when it's wet. Good <br/>
times, huh?<br/>

I can't believe you were here today, Kat!!  I almost went up to <br/>
check on 16-ton.. but decided it was too muddy!! LOL  That has to be <br/>
quite a climb in the rain!  I was down by the river on a nice mostly <br/>
dry trail sitting comfortably on a log while you all were valiantly <br/>
doing the mud tango. <br/>
<br/>
And, y'all need to know that NO one rehides a box like Kat does.  <br/>
She told me that she'd put some extra rocks on 'Big Fish' last time <br/>
she was here because it wasn't very well covered.. when I walked up <br/>
I just wooted out loud.. there was a boulder the size of a cocker <br/>
spaniel on the top of the cairn!  I grinned all day thinking about <br/>
Kat lugging that over there to make sure that box was well hidden!  <br/>
Now THAT is a considerate and thoughtful boxer!  A grateful pirate <br/>
hug comin' your way, Kat. <br/>
<br/>
Y, you're taking the whole onion deal better than I am.  It just <br/>
makes me make the scary face thinking about evil space ranger <br/>
tossing that away.  What.. it was taking up too much room in the <br/>
office?!  It was tiny!!  And you've been calling them ever since <br/>
they dug it up!  Maybe we need to leave messages to the rangers on <br/>
the boxes. <br/>
<br/>
Esmerelda, who can't stop singing '16 ton' now.  <br/>
