Check your clues folks!  The older they are the more likely you may have forgotten you're actually using Geocities? (That was certainly the case for me...)<br>

Hi, Jay Drew here, one of the Letterboxing North America webmasters. We're just touching base with the last of our members who use Geocities to host their letterbox clues. According to the latest faq from Yahoo/Geocities, there is only about one month left before your clues are lost forever. I see that you have used an interesting combo of Geocities and LbNA text in your clue scheme, love it! But I'd hate to see you lose the geocities bits.<br>
<br>
http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/geocities/close/close <br>
<br>
What we are suggesting at this late date is that people consider simply cutting and pasting their clues from either geocities or your home word processor into letterboxing.org. That's a pretty easy fix to avoid losing the clues, even if you plan on setting up your own isp in the future.<br>
<br>
We would be glad to pitch in with this annoying chore if you need some help with it, please don't hesitate to ask.<br>
<br>
Happy boxing, Jay in CT <br>

<br>
The webmasters of LbNA figured out early on just what a pain in the butt this was going to be for folks, since a lot of folks use Geocities for the clues.  Everyone really "learned their lesson" when AOL's web hosting service disappeared a year or so ago without *any* notice...at all.  A TON of clues were lost when AOL went "poof" with no way to get them back.  <br>
<br>
Sooo..... better safe than sorry - please take a moment and check ALL your clues and make sure all is good.  I had a few I had forgotten all about.<br>

And Y: So glad you caught this message.  Wouldn't want any crying about onions.<br>
