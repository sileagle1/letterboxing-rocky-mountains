in a fun weekend of exploring Denver:<br>
<br>
What is Door Open Denver?<br>
DOD is a FREE 2-day event that celebrates architecture and design by <br>
allowing participants to go behind the scenes at more than 70 of <br>
Denver's significant architectural gems and lesser known treasures. DOD <br>
is organized and hosted by the Denver Office of Cultural Affairs. <br>
<br>
More info:  http://tinyurl.com/26s5uh<br>
<br>
This year's dates: April 14-15 so mark your calendars.<br>
<br>
In past years we've gotten to go below the stage at the Paramount <br>
Theatre to see how the organs are lowered and raised, toured small <br>
museums hardly ever open to the public, poked around innovative offices <br>
and work places, a behind the stage (even ON the stage) tour of the <br>
Buell Theatre, lofts tours - even some private residences, and much <br>
more.<br>
<br>
Don't know yet if any more letterboxes might make their appearance in <br>
time for this event, but for those of you who haven't boxed in Denver <br>
for awhile ..There are ...well...more than there used to be before I <br>
got addicted to urban boxing :-)<br>
<br>
The specific building listing for DOD should be out soon, so look for <br>
it on the link above.  We usually get a small group togother to make a <br>
day out of it on one of the days of the weekend.  If you're interested <br>
in joining our group, drop me an email off line.<br>

DAM! and my Hey, Jack Kerouac boxes are close by.<br>
<br>
There are also going to be a few new ones by the time<br>
DOD rolls around.  I finished the stamp for one last<br>
night and I have a sneaky hiding place all picked out<br>
for it.<br>

Denver and all...<br>
<br>
Murmur has certainly hit the high points of what I'd also recommend, <br>
along with Ex Libris, for decent mix of brain twisters and easy ones in <br>
a not too large geographical area.<br>
<br>
I might also note that the (seasonal) Play Ball! has recently returned <br>
for the 2007 season (new stamp, same clues as last year).  My own <br>
personal fave for Denver boxes is TTDIDWYD #1 Riverside Cemetery, even <br>
though it's not in downtown proper where DOD will be.<br>
<br>
Got 2-3 more ready to go for DOD which I really hope I'll have time to <br>
plant when I get back in town in a week.  April is just going to be SO <br>
full for me....<br>
<br>
Ok ya'll, I'm really outta here now and will be offline the better part <br>
of a few weeks.  Will post on DOD specifics around the 6th-7th, so <br>
please check back here then.  It's looking very likely that we'll do a <br>
meet/get together on Sunday 4/15 rather than Satruday 4/14 at this <br>
writing.<br>
