What is Door Open Denver?<br/>
DOD is a FREE 2-day event that celebrates architecture and design by <br/>
allowing participants to go behind the scenes at more than 70 of <br/>
Denver's significant architectural gems and lesser known treasures. DOD <br/>
is organized and hosted by the Denver Office of Cultural Affairs. <br/>
<br/>
More info:  http://tinyurl.com/26s5uh<br/>
<br/>
This year's dates: April 14-15 so mark your calendars.<br/>
<br/>
In past years we've gotten to go below the stage at the Paramount <br/>
Theatre to see how the organs are lowered and raised, toured small <br/>
museums hardly ever open to the public, poked around innovative offices <br/>
and work places, a behind the stage (even ON the stage) tour of the <br/>
Buell Theatre, lofts tours - even some private residences, and much <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
Don't know yet if any more letterboxes might make their appearance in <br/>
time for this event, but for those of you who haven't boxed in Denver <br/>
for awhile ..There are ...well...more than there used to be before I <br/>
got addicted to urban boxing :-)<br/>
<br/>
The specific building listing for DOD should be out soon, so look for <br/>
it on the link above.  We usually get a small group togother to make a <br/>
day out of it on one of the days of the weekend.  If you're interested <br/>
in joining our group, drop me an email off line.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh yeah and I count at least 5 locations on the<br/>
&gt; DOD tour info listing <br/>
&gt; &gt; that already have boxes either already associated<br/>
&gt; with them, or so <br/>
&gt; &gt; close geographically as to be nearly the "same<br/>
&gt; difference."<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hmmmm wonder which ones they are...?<br/>

Denver and all...<br/>
<br/>
Murmur has certainly hit the high points of what I'd also recommend, <br/>
along with Ex Libris, for decent mix of brain twisters and easy ones in <br/>
a not too large geographical area.<br/>
<br/>
I might also note that the (seasonal) Play Ball! has recently returned <br/>
for the 2007 season (new stamp, same clues as last year).  My own <br/>
personal fave for Denver boxes is TTDIDWYD #1 Riverside Cemetery, even <br/>
though it's not in downtown proper where DOD will be.<br/>
<br/>
Got 2-3 more ready to go for DOD which I really hope I'll have time to <br/>
plant when I get back in town in a week.  April is just going to be SO <br/>
full for me....<br/>
<br/>
Ok ya'll, I'm really outta here now and will be offline the better part <br/>
of a few weeks.  Will post on DOD specifics around the 6th-7th, so <br/>
please check back here then.  It's looking very likely that we'll do a <br/>
meet/get together on Sunday 4/15 rather than Satruday 4/14 at this <br/>
writing.<br/>
