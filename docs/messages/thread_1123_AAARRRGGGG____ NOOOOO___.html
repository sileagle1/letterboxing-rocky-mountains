Aljan, I won't be able to reach my son until tomorrow, but, he lives <br>
in Longmont and went with us to find Fodor so he knows the <br>
location.  I will ask him if he can drive by and check it out.  I am <br>

  I am starting to wonder about the person that said he couldn't find it.  That box, I tell you, I get more responses to it from people that don't letterbox than those that do.  Totally not a letterboxer at all.  I'm hoping that he is just completely unable to follow directions or read about trees with fingers and be able to look at one and go - oh that one, right there.

I should automatically pull a box or list it as missing when I get a<br>
report of it missing.  I've even seen times when multiple boxers<br>
report it missing only to have it be right in place.  I'm thinking of<br>
times I've gone to check on a box by A-Bear for her that was sooooo<br>
clearly written I thought nobody could goof it up, and yet they did.<br>
<br>
I'm so glad that your report was erroneous.  I wish I could come out<br>
to find the box, and I wish I could gather.  Right now I'm trying to<br>
figure out when I can get the time to go to Salt Lake to get my<br>
wedding dress.  I even had to turn out a chance to go visit with my<br>
good friends Don and Gwen this weekend in Missoula.  That made me SO<br>
sad!!!!  There is way too much on the plate!!!<br>

Oh well,<br>

PS I apologize, Cadenza, that I've still not checked on your Atoka<br>
box. In the words of the late great Gilda Radner, "There's always<br>
something!" At present my front yard is being demolished and excavated<br>
to correct a wet basement problem. I'm afraid to ask, "What next!?"<br>

I live in Louisville - not far from Lafayette - and I can drive out <br>
there and check on it today. I think between me and the lovely <br>
Peach, we'll give you a firm answer on the status of our dear Fodor. <br>

PS Jim and I are going to try to head up for the Grand Lake gathering <br>
as soon as we get more information on dates and location. Will it be <br>
appropriate to bring the DAWG? (she's our letterboxing good luck <br>
charm now!)<br>

  I am so glad that he is still there.  I love that box!  <br>
   <br>
  *HUGE sigh of relief*<br>
   <br>
  I guess that I better get after a new logbook then.  I'll put it on the list, along with a replacement first finder.  :)<br>
   <br>
  Thanks much!<br>

          I checked on Fodor .. and he is alive and well ... er ... dead and <br>
well? The tree was right where it should be, the box was right where <br>
it should be, and the squirrel must have been off eating pie. <br>
*sigh ... I want pie!*<br>
<br>
I saw no signs of impending landscaping that might involve removing <br>
the lovely cottonwood, and I checked the logbook (which is so <br>
georgeous any of ya'll that haven't gotten this box yet, better get <br>
to it!) - it's getting low on empty spots, though folks could stamp <br>
on the back side of the pages. <br>
<br>
So - False Alarm! His Daytime Resting Place is secure! *salutes*<br>
<br>
And yes!!!!! WE WILL BE AT THE GATHERING!! and I know - seems hard <br>
to fathom that our first gathering was that long ago! Can't wait to <br>
see everyone there!<br>

Good luck, and watch out for that crazy squirrel! I'm sure that <br>
squirrel wouldn't allow them to cut down that tree! <br>
