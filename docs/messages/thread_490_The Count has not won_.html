South Suburban trails maintenance didn't have the Lemony Letterbox <br>
so I am planning to re-carve the same stamp and try to find a better <br>
place in the same area.  I never even got a chance to see who had <br>
stamped in, but if you did, you will have another opportunity (if <br>
this weather ever warms up).<br>
<br>
BTW, I saw a PSA on Nickelodeon about how bad pecan pie is (worse <br>
than cheeseburgers, apparently).  So, does this mean I should avoid <br>
pie altogether, avoid pecan pie or, because it was on Nickelodeon, <br>
are they saying that kids should avoid pie and it is okay for adults <br>
(especially those who get plenty of exercise while letterboxing)?  <br>

Nickelodeon is the devil!!!  Oh, sorry... uncontrollable gut <br>

A PSA about pie cracks me up.  I'm sure they have a point, and I <br>
know it's not good for you, but it's still pie.  "This is your love <br>
handle.  This is your love handle on pecan pie...."  Or a little <br>
vignette about parents practicing on each other how to approach <br>
their teenage daughter about the dangers of pie.  "I hate you!  All <br>
my friends eat pie!" :::slams door::: "If all your friends ate <br>
triple stuff Oreos, would you?! Stay away from pie, missy!" <br>
<br>
I look forward to finding the Lemony Letterbox when it is replaced. <br>
What a bummer to lose it.. I feel so sad when the log books <br>
disappear with all their wonderful stamps and notes.  I also look <br>
forward to finding any other boxes out there without pirate stamps <br>
in them (that aren't in any snakey areas).  Is anyone else getting <br>
some serious cabin/letterboxing fever?  <br>
<br>
Es, who will give a dollar twenty seven...cash money... to anyone <br>
who plants a new box within two hours of Grand Junction<br>

---too funny!  I want to see those ones. <br>
<br>
<br>
Is anyone else getting some serious cabin/letterboxing fever?<br>
<br>
----Oh my, YES!  you know it's bad when I went out in the begining of<br>
this big old storm that just came through and in the dark for a new<br>
letterbox that A-Bear had left for me.  I hadn't been able to break<br>
from work before that and I just couldn't bear to leave the only box<br>
in my area that I haven't found waiting.  I want to letterbox!!  I saw<br>
in my LB announce email for today that CW Sunseeker left a few in UT<br>
and now I'm debating if it is worth driving several hours down on Mon.<br>
to look those up in the snow even though I need to be back that<br>
evening.  I don't think I can justify it just yet, but I just might<br>
talk myself into it yet.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
---LOL- I might just give even more than that.  Man!  I need some<br>
letterboxers who plant in my area.  I think we finally picked up a few<br>
that box.  I've seen some new stamps around, but I need planters, dang<br>
it! I need planters!  (Note the hint of desperacy in my<br>
voice/writing.)<br>
