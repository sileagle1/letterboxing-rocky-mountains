Because of its location, I've pulled Union Station until after the <br>
baseball excitement is over. At that point it will be replaced <br>
promptly, probably with a fresh logbook.<br>

time you get here!  I don't really follow baseball,<br>
but I think it should be over by the end of this<br>
month.  This box is not far from work for me, so as<br>
soon as the baseball fun is over for the Rockies, I'll<br>
pop over to Union Station to replace it.<br>
