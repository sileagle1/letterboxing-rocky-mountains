There is no FF enclosed for those of you halfway out the door because <br>
it is a microbox.  However, if the FF shoots us a message to let us <br>
know they found it, we will email you something special for you LBing <br>
journal.  Check the LBNA website; we haven't posted the clue on <br>
AtlasQuest yet.<br>
<br>
And Dixie:  we will be stamping into your two new boxes in a few weeks <br>
when Stupender Man starts his class at the DCTA.  We knew right were <br>
you the clues would lead us because we walk along that way often when <br>
he is in a class on Saturday mornings.  We're not surprised that PRE <br>
found them first since she seems to be chomping at the bit for more <br>
boxes near Denver.  Hopefully The H-A's will be teaming with PRE for a <br>
box not far from there in the near future.<br>

Stupender Man taking at DCPA???  I want to hear more!<br>
<br>
Yes, PRE gladly pounced on these with glee and I must say she <br>
deserves some FF's after all her new boxes she's been plantin! PRE, <br>
do you have any new ones to report??? <br>
<br>
Hugs, Peach<br>

performing arts classes there for the last 3 or so years.  Highly <br>
recommended for anyone with creative and energetic youngsters.<br>
