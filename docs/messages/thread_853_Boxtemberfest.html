Pirate says is true.  What a great group of folks.  I'm so thrilled that<br/>
I could be at my first gathering and that the rest of the Catamount<br/>
Carvers crew could join us for the Plunder.  New boxes are yet to be<br/>
posted ... some of our own, Tie Dye Girl got out her first plant, as did<br/>
Dixie Peach and Cappy.  All the boxes we found were terrific!  The Grand<br/>
Mesa and Palisades area ... great peaches, great pie, great pirates,<br/>
great boxing and fishing!  Print clues and go!<br/>
<br/>
We hope Kat is feeling better.  We hope to meet you some other time soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks y-nought and Esmerelda for organizing the event!  Thanks to<br/>
Esmerelda and Skeetch for so kindly opening their home to the Rocky<br/>
Mountain Letterboxing community.  What a perfectly wonderful weekend!<br/>

<br/>
Get well Kat. You and Kenna were sorely missed. But I know you will be <br/>
able to make up for it at the next fun fest.<br/>
<br/>
While talking with some of the Parlay-and-Plunderers this weekend it <br/>
always kept coming up what a fun, friendly, interesting and all around <br/>
great group this is. Everybody. The folks that could make it and the <br/>
folks that couldn't. I know that I'll do my best to keep attending <br/>
these things because I just like spending time with you people so much.<br/>
<br/>
And Esmerelda and Skeetch.......how awesome it is that you welcomed <br/>
this group of fanatics into your world for a weekend. Every time I <br/>
think of your yard full of burgers, letterboxes and pie I break into <br/>
that grin again.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everybody!<br/>

<br/>
I'd like to add my celebratory high-fives to those already reported. I<br/>
had a GREAT time at Boxtemberfest. Enjoyed so much seeing y, Dixie and<br/>
Cappy again and meeting Es, Skeetch, TDG, Zoha, LaPaloma and the<br/>
Carvers x 4. Special thanks to Es for hosting and Skeetch for grilling<br/>
and y for the spectacular event stamps! It sounds as if everyone got<br/>
home safe and that's always a good closing to a great event. I<br/>
certainly hope you guys in Moab are feeling better!<br/>
<br/>
I have re-entered Raft the River clues on LBNA an AQ under my name and<br/>
Es has deleted hers, so if you had logged your find, please do it again.<br/>
<br/>
If I have any good photos to add, I'll do that. Can anyone tell me how<br/>
to get them all into one folder?<br/>
