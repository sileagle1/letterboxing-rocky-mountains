It hasn't stopped for us yet. It snowed most of yesterday, but it was warm<br/>
enough that it melted. Today it is coming better and sticking. I'm curious<br/>
to see how it goes. We usually get harsh winters in these parts, but we have<br/>
been in such a nasty drought for years now. Everytime weather approaches us,<br/>
it comes straight at us and then skips over or below our area. I'm hoping we<br/>
break the trend this year. We did better this last spring. This is farm<br/>
country, so everybody is extra sensitive to the snow and rain we receive.<br/>

Hope you all are having a great one!<br/>

Well, it's stayed pretty nippy here. This weekend, before the snow came, it<br/>
was all about the cold wind. I am fine with cold, but 30-40 mph winds in the<br/>
cold is a bit much for me right now.<br/>

About 65 and bright in town. I took the dogs up and went for my <br/>
first snowy hike on the mountain this morning. It is getting windy <br/>
this afternoon with dark, dramatic clouds rolling through. I love <br/>
winter and storms! It is still perfect boxing weather around here!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I hope that you guys get a load then!  It slacked off for a bit <br/>
but <br/>

&gt; &gt; Wow Aljan, sounds like you are getting hit. What part do you <br/>
live <br/>
&gt; in?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It hasn't stopped for us yet. It snowed most of yesterday, but <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; was warm<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough that it melted. Today it is coming better and sticking. <br/>
I'm <br/>
&gt; curious<br/>
&gt; &gt; to see how it goes. We usually get harsh winters in these parts, <br/>
&gt; but we have<br/>
&gt; &gt; been in such a nasty drought for years now. Everytime weather <br/>
&gt; approaches us,<br/>
&gt; &gt; it comes straight at us and then skips over or below our area. <br/>
I'm <br/>
&gt; hoping we<br/>
&gt; &gt; break the trend this year. We did better this last spring. This <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; farm<br/>
&gt; &gt; country, so everybody is extra sensitive to the snow and rain we <br/>
&gt; receive.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope you all are having a great one!<br/>
