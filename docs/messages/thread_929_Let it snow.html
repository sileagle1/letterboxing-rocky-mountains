It hasn't stopped for us yet. It snowed most of yesterday, but it was warm<br>
enough that it melted. Today it is coming better and sticking. I'm curious<br>
to see how it goes. We usually get harsh winters in these parts, but we have<br>
been in such a nasty drought for years now. Everytime weather approaches us,<br>
it comes straight at us and then skips over or below our area. I'm hoping we<br>
break the trend this year. We did better this last spring. This is farm<br>
country, so everybody is extra sensitive to the snow and rain we receive.<br>

Hope you all are having a great one!<br>

Well, it's stayed pretty nippy here. This weekend, before the snow came, it<br>
was all about the cold wind. I am fine with cold, but 30-40 mph winds in the<br>
cold is a bit much for me right now.<br>
