   <br>
  They will be 5 inches of fabulousness.  I have yet to see the final digitizing from the patch company, but I am confident that they're going to be great.<br>
   <br>
  They will be $5.00 each.<br>
   <br>
  They should be ready in about three weeks.  I will start taking orders in two and a half weeks or so, and you will be able to get your patches by sending me a check and a self addressed, stamped envelope.<br>
   <br>
  Can someone tell me if there is a spot, either on AQ or wherever, where I should also advertise them?<br>
   <br>
  Thanks to everyone for your interest in and support of this project!<br>
   <br>
  I can't wait to see these patches around the boxing grounds.<br>

But in case you haven't or for any newer lurkers around these parts, <br>
here are some links for tracking down purchasing and/or promoting <br>
patches and other 'boxing goodies.  <br>
<br>
Yahoo (and pre) often dork up longer URLs..you may need to copy and <br>
paste the *complete* links below into your browser (I can't be bothered <br>
to run the all through tinyurl.com<br>
<br>
AQ T-shirts! Patches! Paraphernalia! message board<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/boards/messages.html?<br>
gMsgId=213810;gBoardId=368<br>
<br>
Newboxer Group home page (email him to have info for patches added)<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br>
<br>
Dixie's patch page:<br>
http://www.dixiegraphix.com/letterbox/patches/main.html#<br>
A very comprehensive list.<br>
<br>
Lock Wench's AQ profile page. She has produced the "Blue Diamond" <br>
letterBOXER patches and also has "merit badges" (for P and F -with <br>
different #s as you like - patches)<br>
<br>
Those are the ones I know about.  Feel free to add other resources if <br>
you know about 'em!<br>
