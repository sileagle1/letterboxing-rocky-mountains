Hey JeLyBean,<br/>
<br/>
Were you able to meet up with any letterboxers in misty Scotland?<br/>
<br/>
I'll bet it was like going back in time, walking around the castles. <br/>
Were you able to visit the Sizemore Field? Or Mont Calm?<br/>
<br/>
Do kilts get cold in the rain?<br/>

Hey, settle down there, y.  I never heard of those places, to be Frank <br/>
&amp; el evation issues prevented us from scaling any mountains, or muros <br/>
as they are called there.  We did get to see where the Declaration of <br/>
Independence was signed (the Scottish one, that is, the document our <br/>
US Declaration was modeled upon) at Arbroath Abbey on the east coast <br/>
of Scotland and of course got to see lots of castles &amp; standing stones <br/>
and cool stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
We didn't get to meet up with Laura or any other 'boxers over there <br/>
but did find one of her letterboxes with a really nice stamp.  And of <br/>
course, we left a letterbox there, too, at an undisclosed location, <br/>
but if you know that secret, let's please keep it between us.<br/>

PS, kilts do get cold in the rain, but all those great single-malts <br/>
take the chill off.<br/>

I have posted it on Atlas Quest, and Laura (from Scotland) has also <br/>
given me permission to re-post hers on Atlas Quest as well.  Laura is <br/>
hoping to get a Scotland LB'ing site up soon where she'll post all of <br/>
them and others.<br/>
