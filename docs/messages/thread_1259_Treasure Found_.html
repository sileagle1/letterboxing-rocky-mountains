Oh, Well. I don't see how the Derby Clue would have taken us there. <br/>
In fact I don't see how ANY of the clues could have led us there. <br/>
It's on a little tiny island between the Trailer Park and the old <br/>
Hospital. In fact, for those of you who might remember, it was hidden <br/>
on the island in the river right by the FIRST hiding place of Three <br/>
Keys Letterbox. I have to admit that placing it on an island is a <br/>
nice touch.<br/>
<br/>
If the aim was to have fun then the hunt was a huge success, not all <br/>
treasure is gold and silver. I SO appreciate everyones energy and <br/>
input on this.<br/>
<br/>
They usually post the clues with the reasons why they are considered <br/>
clues, and when they do I'll be sure to pass those along.<br/>

again I'll be your eyes and ears (only then I'll be wearing a kilt).<br/>

Not that many..... they all have to get double-bagged, the outhouse <br/>
has to be camoflaged and they won't go in until nobody is <br/>
watching.....<br/>
<br/>
The story on the treasure finder:<br/>
<br/>
The guy just had a hunch that it would be on an island, the clues <br/>
didn't really help him much at all. And the island is small enough <br/>
that he just searched every possible nook and cranny.<br/>
<br/>
This is the earliest the Silver Bullet has ever been found. In fact <br/>
they usually don't give clues that mean very much until Thursday <br/>
because they want people to listen to the radio all week. The guy <br/>
that writes the clues was a little dissapointed because the good <br/>
clues were never given. <br/>
<br/>
The finder called the radio station with a deep pirate voice and <br/>
said, "You had better throw in two tickets to next year's Snowdown <br/>
Follies or you'll never see your sweet Silver Bullet again!" and hung <br/>
up. They used caller ID and went to where he worked and made him <br/>
confess to his rogue ways....Fun.<br/>
<br/>
And you bet, PRE, I'll give fair warning for next year's festivities <br/>
in case there be any letterboxers inteterested in a gather.<br/>

<br/>
Cappy and I thought the finder had to know the area to tie in that <br/>
island, because the clues were pretty useless to that point!  <br/>
Aaaarrrr!  At least he was a Jolly fellow to earn that Jolly Roger <br/>
Silver Bullet! <br/>
<br/>
Okay, one thing I learned about the clue writers.  They keep the <br/>
clues very simple in meaning, no hidden meaning!  Like when they say <br/>
it's not in plain sight, it's just that...not in plain sight!  We <br/>
are so used to solving much more challenging riddles that we tried <br/>
too hard to read stuff that just wasn't there!  BLIMEY!  <br/>
<br/>
In the meantime Y, scout out everything in that town that has to do <br/>
with the next theme!  If there are any semblences of a moat, Knight, <br/>
fairie, write down it's location!  Ha!  We will be so prepared!!!  <br/>
And, we all need to request those maps from the Visitors Center to <br/>
refer to...it's like being a bit blindfold when you're not familiar <br/>
with the area! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for letting us share in the fun, Y!  It did bring a <br/>
bit of the festivities to us on the other side of the hill!  Enjoy <br/>
the rest of SNOWDOWN!!!<br/>
<br/>
Hugs, Dreadly...watching more snow out her window and wishing she <br/>
could see the outhouse stuffing contest! <br/>

The same thing happened last year, darn those clever people that found <br/>
it way too quickly when I was away! Peach, I was just on the same track <br/>
you were on with the ATM's. Okay, next year (do we say this every year) <br/>
we should have a winter gathering in Durango and have a group hunt for <br/>
this thing! My head is spinning from all the ideas everyone had for the <br/>
clues!<br/>

Bummer on the news. We were rooting for you - up on deck stomping with <br/>
ES. Just not as loudly. We apparently need to take part in her stomping <br/>
