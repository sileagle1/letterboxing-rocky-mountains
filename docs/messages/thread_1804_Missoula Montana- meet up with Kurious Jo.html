Got an email from Kurious Jo and they are going to be in Missoula tomorrow &amp; Sunday.  She'd like to go somewhere for food &amp; drinks.<br/>
<br/>
Tried calling, but she was still asleep, and I think I woke up her husband!<br/>
<br/>
However-- we are going to meet for dinner tomorrow night- at either Red Robin or Famous Dave's-- unless they hav esomething else in mind.  Just waiting to hear back from her.<br/>
