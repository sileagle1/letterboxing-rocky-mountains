I wouldn't be weirded out, either.  And I don't think five boxes in <br/>
one area is too many.  They'd all have themes and reasons for being <br/>
there.. it's not like you just bought a bunch of stamps of, say, <br/>
little chicks and tossed them in a box!  I'd love to be able to do a <br/>
tour and find a plethora of excellent boxes in a single day! <br/>
Especially if I were learning history and cool facts at the same <br/>
time.  <br/>

&gt; &gt;   I have been contemplating starting up a kinda "morbid history" <br/>
&gt; series that would put LBs around the state that maybe are <br/>
notoriously <br/>
&gt; haunted or where big crimes and such have been committed (first off <br/>
&gt; would you be too weirded out about that) and I want to start here <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; my little mountain town...  but it would end up putting like maybe <br/>
&gt; five LBs right here in town plus more that I already have in <br/>
outlying <br/>
&gt; areas.  Just looking for an opinion - can there be too much of a <br/>
good <br/>
&gt; thing centered around one place?<br/>

  No pie shop Es, but there is an outstanding homemade ice cream shop that is open all summer.  It's a little town, one box is sure to be within walking distance.  Death by Chocolate is my fav...  tell Marty and Diane that Jodie sent you!  Mmmm, choc dipped strawberries...<br/>

  No pie shop Es, but there is an outstanding homemade ice cream shop that is open all summer.  It's a little town, one box is sure to be within walking distance.  Death by Chocolate is my fav...  tell Marty and Diane that Jodie sent you!  Mmmm, choc dipped strawberries...<br/>

All kinds of weird things have happened in these little mountain towns!  I have three in mind - I have to confirm one of the stories as truth (or some semblance of at least) before I go ahead with that one...  and I have to warn the folks at the ice cream shop about pirates before they are struck unawares!<br/>

&gt; Ahhhhh ha ha...  Y you make me laugh.<br/>
&gt; All kinds of weird things have happened in these little mountain <br/>
towns!  I have three in mind - I have to confirm one of the stories <br/>
as truth (or some semblance of at least) before I go ahead with that <br/>
one...  and I have to warn the folks at the ice cream shop about <br/>
pirates before they are struck unawares!<br/>

&gt;     I'm not weirded out by the idea of that many letterboxes in <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; town. But I'm a little freaked by how easy it is for you to find <br/>
&gt; morbid history there. I can't wait 'till you place them so I can <br/>
see <br/>
&gt; what spooky stuff has been happening. Plus, I'm all about the ice <br/>
&gt; cream.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have been contemplating starting up a kinda "morbid history" <br/>
&gt; series that would put LBs around the state that maybe are <br/>
notoriously <br/>
&gt; haunted or where big crimes and such have been committed (first <br/>
off <br/>
&gt; would you be too weirded out about that) and I want to start here <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; my little mountain town...  but it would end up putting like maybe <br/>
&gt; five LBs right here in town plus more that I already have in <br/>
outlying <br/>
&gt; areas.  Just looking for an opinion - can there be too much of a <br/>
good <br/>
&gt; thing centered around one place?<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Have some grrrrreat stamp ideas!<br/>
