> New letterbox: Helen Hunt Falls / Silver Cascade Falls<br>
> Colorado Springs, El Paso County, CO<br>
> Placed by: piano&penguins<br>
> Box webpage located at:<br>
><br>
> Clues:<br>
> The trail starts at the Helen Hunt Falls Visitor Center in North Cheyenne<br>
Caon Park.<br>
><br>
> Difficulty: Easy [placed by two 6-year old children :-)]<br>
> Distance: Approximately 0.6 miles round trip<br>
> Elevation Gain: 7225' to 7400'<br>
><br>
> Directions:  To get to the Helen Hunt Falls Visitor Center from Hwy 24 and<br>
21st St, go south on 21st St. (which becomes Cresta along the way)<br>
approximately 3 miles until you come to Cheyenne Blvd.  Turn right (west)<br>
onto Cheyenne Blvd. (which becomes Cheyenne Rd. along the way) and go<br>
approximately 1 mile until you come to the Starsmore Discovery Center (2120<br>
W. Cheyenne Rd.) at the entrance to North  Cheyenne Caon Rd. (By the way,<br>
this Starsmore Discovery nature center is definitely worth visiting if you<br>
have the time and inclination!) Turn right onto North Cheyenne Caon Rd. and<br>
go approximately 2 miles up the canyon until you see a large parking lot on<br>
the right with porta-potties, and several parking spaces in front of a small<br>
log building by a waterfall.  This is the Helen Hunt Falls Visitor Center.<br>
Park here.<br>
><br>
> Walk past the visitor center on compass bearing 304' and follow the trail<br>
along the rock wall up to the bridge over Helen Hunt Falls.  You can look<br>
right down on the falls from this bridge.  This is also a great photo<br>
opportunity when your picture is taken from below.  Now the fun climbing and<br>
counting starts!<br>
><br>
> Cross the bridge and climb up 34 stairs to the first flat spot.  Then<br>
climb 15 mores stairs and cross another small bridge.  Now count 18 stairs,<br>
and then 19 loosely-defined, well-spaced stairs.  Next, you walk over some<br>
big rocks.  Then take 30 more stairs, then climb with very few defined<br>
stairs until you come to a rock wall.  You can explore around here to your<br>
left.  You will find a spring and a great lookout point for Silver Cascade<br>
Falls above.<br>
><br>
> When finished exploring, go back to the main trail (officially called<br>
Silver Cascade Trail), and climb 6 more stairs, then walk over some<br>
half-buried tree roots.  Next take 3 more rock stairs.  Walk between some<br>
big boulders until you come to the first ponderosa pine tree in the middle<br>
of the trail.  From here, go to the second ponderosa pine in the trail.  Put<br>
your back to this second pine and take a compass bearing of 220' to another<br>
ponderosa pine.  Behind this third pine tree is a tiny trail.  You are<br>
almost there!  (If you went to the bridge that crosses the creek on the main<br>
trail, then you went too far and missed the turnoff trail.)<br>
><br>
> Take this small side trail up several yards to a small boulder with an<br>
overhang that faces the creek and main trail. The letterbox is under the<br>
overhang of this small boulder, behind a small log.  Please take the<br>
letterbox back to the main trail and continue over the bridge and up the<br>
main trail a very short distance to the turn-around point.  Here the trail<br>
ends and you get a nice view of Silver Cascade Falls and of some of Colorado<br>
Springs to the east.   After stamping the journal, etc., please put the<br>
letterbox back exactly as you found it.  The small log is needed to hide the<br>
box from the view of casual hikers on the main trail.<br>
><br>
> Now enjoy the hike down, but be careful because it can be very slippery.<br>
PLEASE STAY ON THE MAIN TRAILS ONLY.  Silver Cascade Falls area is one of<br>
the most dangerous in the whole canyon!  It is said that people have<br>
accidentally slipped down and over the falls when wandering off the trail<br>
trying to get to the falls.  Be very cautious, and Happy Hiking!<br>
