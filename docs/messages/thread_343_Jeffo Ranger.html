                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just met up with Ranger Eric at Deer Creek to help him locate<br>
Rattlesnake Gulch.  What a nice man!  I asked him if he had his own<br>
stamp yet, he said no, but his wife is VERY interested =]<br>
 <br>
Anyway - he is the same ranger that located my Swimming in Opposite<br>
Directions box... he told me that box will have to be moved.  So, I plan<br>
to make a large note on the clues page that says the box is unavailable<br>
(it will still be there, I just don't want new people going to look for<br>
it).  Tomorrow, I will hopefully be able to get out there and find a new<br>
location for it.  Then I will have to apply for the new spot... in other<br>
words, it may take a few weeks for the box to get a new home.<br>
 <br>
If you haven't found it, and want to find it - I suggest pulling the<br>
clues ASAP.  Unless I have to - I will leave the box in its current spot<br>
till I get approval for the new location.<br>
 <br>
PS - I left a temporaty hiker at Rattlesnake while I was there. =]  Of<br>
course, I was in a hurry, and no prepared to be out boxing, so I didn't<br>
stamp the hiker into the letterbox.... oops.<br>

Yes, did he give you any reason WHY it has to be moved?  Curious as I<br>
await approval on two boxes myself.<br>
Best wishes,<br>

it isn't too bad of a spot, but they have to stick to the rules.. also,<br>
they could "already see a path" going up to the box... I am not sure how<br>
- I didn't know you could leave a path on a rock.  Yes, the tree branch<br>
is slightly bent (I went by there today), but come winter that tree<br>
branch won't exist.<br>
 <br>
Oh well.. I will move it... I tried today, but when we got .56 miles<br>
into the trail my 2 year old gave out and he was too heavy to carry the<br>
rest of the way.  2 soccer games this weekend means I won't get up there<br>
to find a new spot... so it will be a couple of weeks before I can apply<br>
for a new location.<br>

Debbi...correct me if I'm wrong, but my guess is that they didn't <br>
approve because you have to somewhat climb up onto the rocks?  If <br>
so, that's too bad, because in my humble opinion, the rocks yours is <br>
hidden in isn't of the fragile nature of the type they are worried <br>
about.  I don't want to say anymore, because I don't want to give <br>
away the "mystery".  <br>
