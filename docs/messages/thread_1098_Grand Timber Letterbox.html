Ani-mauled - snort - very punny, all over again, FRH :-)  <br/>
<br/>
I know I'll be in or through Breck many times this summer, including <br/>
for sure, passing through for Memorial Day weekend.  More than happy <br/>
to help replace then or anytime you got it ready to go again, <br/>

cheers and sorry again about your box!<br/>

It is in the same general area that the last box sufferred a bear attack but not the exact location.  Hopefully the elves that live there will protect the box.<br/>
