luck on a recent weekend trip, and a great set of trail maps, I <br>
have... (pause for effect) SOLVED the Bard's Tale.  Yes!<br>
<br>
I am arranging a trip.  Due to the remoteness of the box in the Kiedy- <br>
Swinie Leca Wilderness, it is going to be a backpacking overnight.  I <br>
don't presently have the backpacking gear and if you've looked at <br>
REI's prices lately, you will see it is going to take me some time to <br>
save up the cash.  Then I thought others might like to go too, who may <br>
also need time to purchase proper equipment.  So, I have set the start <br>
date for one year from today.  If you would like to join me on this <br>
grand excursion, please email me off list at jelybean "at" <br>

JeLyBean), started to search high and low for the Kiedy Swinie-Leca. <br>
Not only do I have the gear, but it was still packed and I was <br>
determined to scoop the dreaded Bean by almost a year.<br>
<br>
Only later this morning, while perusing the REI catalogue did I <br>
suspect something was fishy in JeLyLand.<br>
<br>
I have to admit, I was pretty dang worked up about it for a while.<br>

y-nought, ....back from the wilderness with a gleam in his eye and a <br>
coupla fresh stamps in his book....<br>
