I am arranging a trip.  Due to the remoteness of the box in the Kiedy- <br/>
Swinie Leca Wilderness, it is going to be a backpacking overnight.  I <br/>
don't presently have the backpacking gear and if you've looked at <br/>
REI's prices lately, you will see it is going to take me some time to <br/>
save up the cash.  Then I thought others might like to go too, who may <br/>
also need time to purchase proper equipment.  So, I have set the start <br/>
date for one year from today.  If you would like to join me on this <br/>

JeLyBean), started to search high and low for the Kiedy Swinie-Leca. <br/>
Not only do I have the gear, but it was still packed and I was <br/>
determined to scoop the dreaded Bean by almost a year.<br/>
<br/>
Only later this morning, while perusing the REI catalogue did I <br/>
suspect something was fishy in JeLyLand.<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit, I was pretty dang worked up about it for a while.<br/>
