stamp pad (still shrink wrapped) and a 'temporary journal'.. which <br>
looked like a little spiral notebook someone had made notes in and <br>
used in a pinch. No stamp. <br>
It's possible it was under a different log than you left it.. it <br>
wasn't the log that I felt like the clues led me to. I just decided <br>
to check the one up the hill from it, just in case!<br>
We stamped in, repacked it and hid it carefully.<br>
If you want to know anything else about our visit, just let me know <br>
here or in e-mail. <br>
