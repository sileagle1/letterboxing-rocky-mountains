Hello everybody,<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to this board and pretty new to the whole LB thing.  This is<br/>
my first post to RML. <br/>
<br/>
I received, and sent on, my first PLB this week: Alex's Birthday PLB.<br/>
 It had a HH with it that I placed today in "Furry Friends Series #2"<br/>
in Ogden UT.  The owner of the HH requested that its location be<br/>
published in hopes that it might reach N IN in time for Alex's<br/>
birthday in August.  Seemed like a good idea to post to the regional<br/>
board.  So here it is.<br/>

Hiya Boxer!<br/>
<br/>
She wants the HH to reach northern Indiana?  We better hurry!  I can <br/>
sense a road trip in my future!<br/>

Es, who wonders if Boxer knows the rule about new members bringing <br/>
pie...<br/>
