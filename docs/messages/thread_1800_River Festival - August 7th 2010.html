<br/>
There will be a dozen or more nature stations located near the picnic area of the park, where visitors can examine insects, learn about tracks, make river crafts, learn to fish and  participate in activities for all ages.   When you stop by the welcome station, you'll receive a passport that can be stamped at each of the nature stations by answering a simple question.<br/>
<br/>
At least 5 of the passport stamps will be handcarved letterbox stamps, and there will be a bonus letterbox clue available for people who complete their passport.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone would like to donate a small stamp for the event, please let me know.  Anything related to river life would be great!<br/>
