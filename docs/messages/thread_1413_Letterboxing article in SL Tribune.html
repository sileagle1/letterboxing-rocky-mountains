What a great article. I love the pictures and the fact that it mentions <br>
Mount Doom and a certain fairy under a cliff.....<br>

 I wonder if it will mean a few more letterboxers  get started up in <br>
the Salt Lake Area.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
