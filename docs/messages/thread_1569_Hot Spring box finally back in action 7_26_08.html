mailed to me last fall, one super hard winter in the CO Rockies, one <br/>
spring trip to the Western Slope to replace the stamp only to find <br/>
logbook soaking wet, a trip home to make a new book, and yet another <br/>
trip to the Western Slope to fiiinally get this box back in action...<br/>
<br/>
Only took nearly 11 months, BUT my box Hot Spring in Glenwood Springs <br/>
is back in action!<br/>
