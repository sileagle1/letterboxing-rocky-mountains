said some of his "boxes" had no stamps, but were only verification <br>
that you had solved the clues. I'm thinking that might be why it is <br>
listed as "no box". And with those clues it would make sense. Nobody <br>
is going to fill up their logbook with stamps from Randy Hall mystery <br>
boxes.<br>
