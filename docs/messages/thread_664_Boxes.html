Boxerlover - I did not get your stamp in my book either.  I thought <br>
your stamp was so pretty and your carving was great. Thanks for the HH <br>
and I will be anxious to get it to Indiana. While in Moab, we only <br>
found seven successfully, but searched for three others very <br>
diligently and did not find them.  I could not figure out <br>
which "boulder" was the house on "Searching".   And, Dixie Peach, I <br>
saw your picture in Negro Bill's canyon at the waterfall...did you <br>
find that box? If you did, I am so jealous!!!  <br>
<br>
Sunseeker - we did spend several days in Phoenix but I did not <br>
Letterbox while there...so sad.  Long story.  Next time for sure and <br>
it may not be too long.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed reading all the messages about our gathering and definitely <br>
enjoyed meeting all of you.  Yes, thanks, Kat, Y and Rivergeek for the <br>
gathering.  Y - I still want to find that onion you planted...can <br>
smell it from here calling, calling.   So many boxes, so many and I <br>
want them all.    Puppypaws (enjoying  the rain in Littleton, but <br>
wishing for sun)<br>

Puppypaws, YES, we found the box in Negro Bill's Canyon!  I'm sorry <br>
you didn't find it; all I can think of is you were searching in the <br>
wrong spot.  If you want to email me off list, I can tell you where <br>
we found it.  Isn't it beautiful there!  Thanks again to our Moab <br>
boxers for leading us onto some great trails and fantastic scenery!  <br>
Alas, like you, we didn't find Searchin either.  A storm was brewing <br>
and we were afraid to look too long and get caught in it.  <br>
<br>
Hugs, Dixie Peach<br>
