          I found out that Drewclan placed the Fountain Valley Box in <br>
Roxbury before they placed the Loveland Box. This woiuld make it the <br>
first box placed in Colorado. Do any of you Front Rangers or <br>
Traveling Boxers have the date that box was placed written in your <br>
logbooks? If it is before July 13, 2000 then we need to let Mark Pepe <br>
know so he can change the info on his list. Anybody?....<br>

      Thanks Lisa, but now I am really confused. If anyone has any <br>
other information on dates of the early boxes in Colorado I would <br>
like to hear it. <br>

P.S. I just returned from a backpacking trip with my kids where we <br>
stamped into the Dark Canyon box in Utah. Superb.              <br>
