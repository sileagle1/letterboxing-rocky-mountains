I seriously thought about this but I also remember what a mess the front gates are at 10am and figured it would be very tough to find you. Then if I did, to get away from the gates to stamp. I know you all had fun and if you planned to do it again next year I will just wait for that weekend to go to the faire! <br>
 <br>
But... did you all see the guy selling Puke and Snot t shirts and stuff down the hill from the show. he looked quite a bit like captain Jack Sparrow. Of course he was dressed like him and I had my picture taken with him. The closest I will ever get to Johnny Depp. I just thought he might appeal to Es!!! Pretty darn cute! <br>
 <br>
Ah... a man in leather and tights! Just makes a girl smile! <br>

Hi Kris-<br>
<br>
I am literally heading out the door to drive up to Larkspur, so I <br>
won't be able to read any reply. <br>
<br>
I haven't heard of anyone else who wants to meet up outside the faire <br>
besides you. But I do know that Esmerelda will be at the gates at <br>
10:00AM on Sunday and so will my boys and I. If it works out for you <br>
we could look for you at the gates, and if it doesn't then no biggie <br>
and we will just go in.<br>
<br>
I will be wearing a kilt and a purple hat and will be with my two <br>
teenage sons. Esmerelda will be in Pirate garb, of course.<br>
<br>
Hope to see you, but if not we will just meet up next time.<br>
<br>
Huzzah!<br>

Captain Jack chatted with us several times during the day.  You know <br>
