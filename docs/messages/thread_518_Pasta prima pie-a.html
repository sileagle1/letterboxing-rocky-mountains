It took me two tries to do it, but your very lovely Johnny Carino <br>
stamp is now mine... mine!!<br>
The journal is way cool!  Aside from the cuteness factor, I would <br>
love to know how you cut all the edges so evenly!! <br>
And no one called the cops!  Which, in my mind, makes it a <br>
successful find. <br>
Woohoo... thanks!!<br>
<br>
Es, wondering what Kat will spend her dollar twenty seven on<br>

Nee na nee na nee - doing an Italian first finder dance for Es! But <br>
(now I'm whispering and making sure no one is looking) the journal <br>
was in a fifty cent bin at Target. I was out of supplies to make my <br>
journals (which is one reason I WENT to Junction that day) and so I <br>
did a total makeover on the store bought journal, which is why it <br>
had perfect edges! I bought a few of the Target journals in case of <br>
quick needs or low supplies a month or so ago. Very handy! Michael's <br>
in Junction had sets of brush pens for rubber stamping that are <br>
pretty cool. I bought a set to try out, and they are great. You can <br>
color the stamps in all sorts of different colors in detail. I might <br>
have to spend my dollar twenty-seven on a brush pen!<br>
