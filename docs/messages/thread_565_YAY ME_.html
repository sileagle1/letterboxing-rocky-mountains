                    <div class="plaintext-content">I use some nice heavier weight paper for thie inside pages, cutting them to the size that I wanted and then tore what will end up being the outer edge of the book.  ...I think that the torn edges look really cool, you could cut them or just fold your paper so the edges are straight just as easily.  I used a heavier weight cardstock for the covers.  The covers don't fold around the spine part - they just cover the front and back sides.  I used a ruler to fold a nice straight edge on the pages near the "spine" so that they will open more easily...  I put the fold about 1/2 an inch from the "spine" on one and then an inch on another as I tied it together with buttons and needed more room.  Does that make ANY sense?  I group two or three of the pages together then, you know one inside the other...  and then stack the groups on top of one another, then I used a hole punch and made three holes down the side.  One book I tied with ribbons, knotting them on the sides and then on a second I<br>
 ran ribbon through buttons on the back and front and then knoted the ribbon on the front side.  I think they look great!  I made one little book too where I used one of those paper fasteners (they kinda look like a tack, slide them through a hole in the paper and then separate the prongs and press tham back against the paper?) that one was kinda fun because you could swing the pages around and off to the side and stamp in on a nice flat surface.  I did the same thing there, used a nice light colored heavier weight paper (so the ink doesn't seep through) and then did a cover with heavy cardstock.  <br>
 <br>
I'm excited, I think they look really nice!<br>
