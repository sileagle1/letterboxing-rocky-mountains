York boxes, the Eternal Flame, near Buffalo.  At first, I thought, wow, <br/>
a lot of people went to find my box this week.  But as more and more of <br/>
these rolled in,  with more and more details, I finally pieced together <br/>
that there was a gathering near that box, with the Eternal Flame as <br/>
sort of a centerpiece for the gathering.  Today I got an email from <br/>
none other than Green Tortuga himself, a veritable letterboxing <br/>
celebrity.  How strange to have one of my boxes picked out as a focal <br/>
point for a gethering.  This ever happen to anyone?<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Eternal Flame is cool; not the box, but the incredible natural <br/>
phenomenon.  Flaming waterfall.  No joke.  If you're ever near Buffalo, <br/>
be sure to check it out.<br/>
