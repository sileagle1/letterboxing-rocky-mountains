What were the names of the two boxes in the "ARRTOY KPRA" series?  I also have a stamp that I don't believe is listed yet...something like "Rock Crawler" or "Rock Climber" or something like that.

<br>
ARRTOY KPRA boxes - #1) Roadrunner....  and #2) Coyote's After You<br>
<br>
The event box didn't have a name, but hopefully this week I'll have <br>
time to hide it on a trail near town and then I'll give it a name!<br>
<br>
The other boxes I don't know about, I'm sure someone else can help!<br>

Rock Climber was the one by CW Sunseeker placed near Moab Man.  Hope <br>
that helps.  =-)  <br>
