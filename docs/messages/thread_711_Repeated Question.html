I know we can't place boxes in National Parks (like Estes). but what about<br/>
National Forests?  We drove through Pike NF this weekend and it was<br/>
BEAUTIFUL!  And there were a TON of places for some great boxes!!! =]<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As far as I know there is nothing that prohibits letterboxes on <br/>
National Forest land, and that's where a lot of my letterboxes are. <br/>
They , and the BLM, are quite a bit more relaxed about how they <br/>
manage public lands. There isn't anywhere near the concentration of <br/>
people that the National Parks have. Plus they give out grazing, <br/>
mining, and logging permits to various contractors. In my opinion <br/>
these are much better places for letterboxing than Parks and <br/>
Monuments.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents,<br/>
