How in the world did a completely tongue-in-cheek comment from Ryan that<br/>
turned into one of the funniest threads we've had for a while suddenly swap<br/>
to a flame?  I think I got whiplash somewhere along the way!  My word, a few<br/>
innocent jokes are beginning to turn into another stupid argument.  I am<br/>
constantly amazed at the ability of people on the site to take things so<br/>
personally. <br/>
<br/>
I know this wasn't a true flame, but you know how you can just feel them<br/>
turning as the tone of emails changes?  -That "oh help us, here it comes<br/>
again" feeling.  Hope I didn't offend any here.  I was just being a little<br/>
annoyed and wanted to vent for a small moment.  I love reading my emails<br/>
from the list.  I just hate it when it becomes a personal argument.  It kind<br/>
of defeats the whole purpose, you know?  Thanks for the moment, I'll shut my<br/>
trap now :-)<br/>

Oh, I was laughing too.  I was one of the ones that commented about falling off my chair.  I think it was more the posts that were starting to sneek in yesterday along the lines of "fine, maybe I shouldn't write about things anymore that were getting to me" when it was really nothing other than a good natured ribbing.  To each their own I guess.  I'm happy again today.  Sorry about my rant yesterday.<br/>

Sounds OK to me. I'm so glad there's a local list now. I'll admit <br/>
that I can only skim the headers of the main list now because the <br/>
traffic is so high. When I started seeing "sitrep" in the subject on <br/>
every other post, I just ignored them altogether. Anything with that <br/>
many replies is usually a flame or troll. I can barely skim the <br/>
headers of all my lists now and fear that anything I write back will <br/>
only get lost in the noise. If CT and the northeast would start their <br/>
own local list, I expect that traffic would drop 50% or more on the <br/>
main list. I hate to see letterboxing fragment into different groups <br/>
but Wow! it's hard to keep up with things now. I enjoy being able to <br/>
actually READ all the posts here to keep up with local goings-on. <br/>
Speaking of which, how was the Bailey expedition??<br/>
