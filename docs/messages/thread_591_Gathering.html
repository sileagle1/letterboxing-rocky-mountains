I am finally back home.  After the gathering we hung around in Moab <br/>
several days then went to Phoenix for a week.  I sure enjoyed meeting <br/>
all of you at the gathering and wish I could have stayed a little <br/>
longer. I thought my family was pretty nice to give me 2 hours, but I <br/>
could have used 4. (never happy)  My husband got a real good picture <br/>
of the stamp page that we all stamped on and a few pictures of the <br/>
group.  I am still trying to get names with faces and wish I had just <br/>
lined everyone up and took a group shot.  Did anyone do that?  I found <br/>
several boxes in Moab and hid a little HH in one.  I am disappointed <br/>
that I did not find the box in Negro Bill's canyon....looked and <br/>
looked and I am wondering if it is missing.  Also did not find Ticaboo <br/>
but found Lulu and we sure had fun in that place - it was a beautiful <br/>
spot.  Is Ticaboo missing, Kat?  Or were four of us just too dumb to <br/>
find it???   Maybe you don't want to answer that!!  Anyway, now I will <br/>
catch up on all my email and LB emails - I have 175 emails to <br/>
read!!!   Puppypaws (ready for a gathering in Colorado)<br/>

Welcome back Puppypaws!<br/>
<br/>
It was great fun to meet you and get your stamp image. <br/>
<br/>
There are some pictures from the gathering in the photos section of <br/>
this group. I labeled one of the group shots to help me remember who <br/>
everyone was.<br/>
<br/>
And I think everyone is ready for more gatherings.<br/>
<br/>
Yippie!<br/>

Welcome home, Puppypaws! wow, what a fun trip you must have had! Did <br/>
you find any boxes down in Phoenix? It was wonderful meeting you and <br/>
your wonderfully understanding friends at the gathering. I missed <br/>
out on getting your stamp for my journal, but that wonderful little <br/>
dog will be in some of my box journals, I'm sure! <g><br/>
<br/>
Ticaboo is safe and cozy up under her rock. For some reason, almost <br/>
everyone has had trouble finding this box. Only a handful have come <br/>
through with flying colors. It seems that most people haven't gone <br/>
up the wash far enough to get to the top of the second pourover, <br/>
maybe 1/2 mile from the tunnel. You'll have to visit the spot <br/>
again!!! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
We just got home last night from a short weekend in St. George (team <br/>
dance for Aspen)and had fun finding two of CW Sunseeker's boxes on <br/>
the drive over. Yay!<br/>
<br/>
I'm so sorry to hear all the woes of our little group, poor Stubby! <br/>
And I cannot believe someone urinated on a box. Why are there such <br/>
sickos? Geez!!<br/>
<br/>
Kenna and I had great fun the other evening hunting in near dark <br/>
with a big ol moon overhead. We happily stamped in at "art on the <br/>
rocks", one of the wonderful new boxes in Moab.<br/>
<br/>
Kat (also in the rain today, carving away)<br/>
