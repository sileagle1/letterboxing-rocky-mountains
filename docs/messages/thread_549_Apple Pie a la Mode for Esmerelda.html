Hey Es -<br>
<br>
Greetings from southern California!  I just wanted to let you know <br>
that I planted two boxes in your honor (the Apple Pie a la Mode <br>
series) in Julian this past weekend.  The clues are listed on LBNA <br>
and Atlas Quest.  So, if you ever make it out to this neck of the <br>
woods, there's a nice big piece of pie just waiting for you!<br>
<br>
I'm still waiting to hear about my Horsetooth box, but I'll let <br>
everyone know the minute I know it's been returned to its home.<br>
<br>
Have a great week!<br>
Cattail  :)<br>

Happy Birthday, Es!  And, coincidentally, I planted those boxes the <br>
day after my own birthday (I turned 31 on the 25th)!  I always have <br>
angel food cake on my birthday, but for some reason, I had a craving <br>
for apple pie (maybe it has something to do with me reading this <br>
chat list on a regular basis).  Pisces sisters unite!<br>
<br>
