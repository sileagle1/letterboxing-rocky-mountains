&gt; On a similar note, but different kind of box - yesterday at work I <br/>
&gt; asked folks if they had any small metal boxes (like <br/>
&gt; Altoid/Bandaid) 'cause I have plans for some micro boxes.  I expected <br/>
5 <br/>
&gt; or so.  Imagine my surprise when I came into find an entire bag on my <br/>
&gt; desk!  And this is only the day after I asked.  I'm now expecting <br/>
I'll <br/>
&gt; probably get inundated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If any boxers can use some of these (I got a lot of Altoid boxes) <br/>
&gt; please let me know. I'd hate to just transfer them from the storage <br/>
&gt; places of my colleagues to my own. Rather see them used for LBs!<br/>

I'm not really in a spot for mini boxes right now, but best of luck.<br/>
Remember to hide them well in spots that will stay more clear from<br/>
moisture.  I have seen boxes destroyed so quickly with access to the<br/>

do them and where they are.<br/>
