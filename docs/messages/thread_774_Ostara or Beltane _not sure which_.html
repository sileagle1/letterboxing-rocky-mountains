                    <div class="plaintext-content">I got an email today from a man who was at Chatfield on the 4th and <br/>
found one of my boxes, but he didn't say which one.  He apparently <br/>
didn't read the "this is not trash, please re-hide" thing on the front <br/>
of the box, and he pulled it.  He offered to mail it back to me - which <br/>
was very kind.  <br/>
<br/>
I've written him back to ask him to replant the box (perhaps we'll get <br/>
a new letterboxer out of it?) which would save him the postage.  <br/>
Hopefully he is willing to do that.  I'll send him the clues once I <br/>
figure out which box it is that he has taken.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile - please consider both of these boxes down until I figure out <br/>
which one it is.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
