surprised to find the log book almost half full!<br>
I just want to let anyone know who has already printed this out that, <br>
even though there are markers in the box, you are more than welcome <br>
to use your own stamp pads as the markers are getting dry and I won't <br>
have time to replace them for a bit. <br>
Also, we really noticed how much everything has grown around there <br>
during the summer which changes how everything looks.. you can still <br>
find it but you'll have to look a little harder! :D<br>
