Autumn,<br/>
I appreciate what your doing but I would not like for my clues to be <br/>
posted this way. One of the things I like about letterboxing (as <br/>
opposed to geocaching)is that the LbNA site will link directly to an <br/>
offsite clue. This allows me to update, change, or remove the clue as <br/>
necessary without having to chase down various versions of the clue <br/>
in different places.<br/>
Maybe an alternative to copying _all_ the clues is to copy those that <br/>
are on the LbNA site (where people have relinquished control of the <br/>
content), and to create documents with the link only to offsite clues <br/>
(where people have preferred to keep control of the clues). That <br/>
works as a backup for the main site but keeps the control, <br/>
formatting, etc. of offsite clues in the hands of those who've chosen <br/>
to list their clues that way.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again (no hot water, just a request)<br/>

<br/>
I didn't really have a plan in mind when I began posting the backup <br/>
version of the clues.  Only that I was worried that some of <br/>
the "unclaimed" boxes might be removed, and if something were to <br/>
happen to the LbNA system, we'd still be okay on some level.  (I <br/>
probably should sell insurance for a living or something, eh?)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - Here's one solution for boxes in CO and elsewhere in the <br/>
rockies - particularly your own boxes ... These backup clues are just <br/>
Word documents.  I believe that anyone can add or delete them (if <br/>
that's not the case, let me know and I'll fix it so everyone can, I'm <br/>
just too sleepy to check it before I post this message!)<br/>
<br/>
If something about your box changes - just delete the file and post a <br/>
new one.  For the folks who are not on this board, well - I guess its <br/>
a risk.  I suppose the alternative is to just rely on the lbna <br/>
board.  <br/>
<br/>
For those folks who keep their clues on their own websites and <br/>
provide links to lbna ... I think it would be great to have those <br/>
links posted here as well.  Perhaps just the link to your main site <br/>
to where folks can then go and find your clues.<br/>
<br/>
I'm rambling and exceptionally tired ..<br/>
Off to bed,<br/>
