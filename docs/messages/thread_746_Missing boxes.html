geocache box that I looked at this morning at Roxborough was full of <br/>
little trinkets and even a water gun.  The Rangers really do not like <br/>
this type of stuff and questioned me about my Letterboxes that are <br/>
there.  I told them that we only used stamps and logbooks and did not <br/>
put in trinkets and I think this makes it more favorable for us. They <br/>
also did not like that the box was so big.  I am thinking of moving <br/>
Puma Prints into the Visitor's Center - and they liked that idea and <br/>
will get back to me on this.  This way, they could monitor the box a <br/>
little closer and maybe we can win their hearts and minds!!!   Even <br/>
tho I am a volunteer ranger at another park - I can "feel" the tension <br/>
when I talk about LB's  -  so, I don't.<br/>

The people who found the journal are sending it to me, then I think <br/>
I'll send it on to Cattail in California and just retire the box.  <br/>
But next time I'm up there, I may leave something else behind! Woot!<br/>

I'm so sorry about the box!  But at least we still have the journal <br/>
which is the heart of it!  After I get it and read it I'll send it <br/>
on to you and you can add it to your scrapbook.  Just email me your <br/>
address in California and I'll shoost it your way. <br/>
<br/>
Email away!  I have a scrapbook of all my placed boxes and I'd love <br/>
to add some of your things to the Cattail page!<br/>
<br/>
You know, instead of remaking this one about your final days of <br/>
schooling, the replacement should be about what you're doing now.. a <br/>
follow up!  We'll have to chat in email, eh?<br/>
