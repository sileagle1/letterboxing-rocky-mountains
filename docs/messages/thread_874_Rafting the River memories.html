                    <div class="plaintext-content">Es:  For what it's worth:  So far, I do all my stamping in with <br>
markers.  I get so much more flexibility, generally and they give me <br>
lots more color...I like color!  I especially like "Mr. Sketch" <br>
markers.  They're made for flip chart paper (we use them at work, <br>
which is how I discovered them) so they don't! bleed through <br>
paper....and they SMELL yummy! Don't know "how" a set made it into my <br>
LBing bag.....<scratchs head>, or who thought of making markers have <br>
smells in the first place....<br>

<newbie piping up on list for first time, as encouraged :-) ><br>

Hiya all you pie lovers!!  I'll give anyone, erm.......a FREE SMILE! <br>
if they can even BEGIN to 'splain me this pie thing.  I'm told no one <br>
really remembers how it started.  Surely (shirley?) someone can at <br>
least attempt it?<br>

I started LBing out of Denver on Labor Day this year.  Found some fun <br>
stuff (up to almost 10 so far...not to danged shabby IMHO for less <br>
than 3 weeks at it, when my "other life is insane @ moment...) <br>
<br>
And - I'm SO close to my first plant in Denver. Anyone in Central <br>
Denver?  I'm looking to play together, collaborate or challenge each <br>
other to get some LBing action going here...!!<br>
<br>
Wish I'd discovered LBing sooner (like so many others..) 'cause I've <br>
BEEN to so many of these places.  Am now well and truly addicted! :-)<br>
<br>
Special shout out to Es for her encouragement off list to join in the <br>
fun, publicly..and well for Bill..my LBing inspiration, so far.  His  <br>
suit, in my book anyway, is literally very colorful 'cause of them der <br>
markers....he WAS a showman afterall..)<br>
<br>
<br>
Howdy!<br>
