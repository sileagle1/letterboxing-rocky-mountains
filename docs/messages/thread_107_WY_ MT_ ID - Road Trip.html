                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Ewok,<br>
<br>
sorry it's taken a bit.  I will try to tackle some of the boxes to let you<br>
know, and hope I haven't missed you before your big trip.  I will be<br>
impressed if you make it out to all these areas, but since I don't know your<br>
itinerary, I will try to include all I can remember off the top of my head.<br>
I just wrote a brief summary of the UT boxes for someone else, so I'll past<br>
that for you.  It wore me out though (it's been a long week) so I don't<br>
think I will feel up to doing the same for all of the boxes in each of the<br>
states.  I will try to give you any pertinent info.<br>
<br>
Idaho:  First and foremost, I would love an exchange :-)  Feel free to let<br>
me know when you are heading this direction and if you are interested we can<br>
meet for an exchange. (How's that for self-serving?) If I have time, I will<br>
also try to get out to replace a couple of my stamps that have been dragged<br>
off my animals or other mammals.  I'm in the Idaho Falls area.<br>
<br>
Eastern: All of the boxes around Idaho Falls are intact and great finds for<br>
families.  There are at least seven boxes that just follow the park that is<br>
along the river in the downtown area-easy finds.  Two boxes are hidden by a<br>
cave outside IF, they were easy finds and the kids might get a kick out of<br>
the cave, but I wouldn't recommend going after dark. Swan Valley is MIA.  It<br>
is my first plant ever and is in a beautiful spot, so I will definitely<br>
replace it as soon as I can. Swan Valley is on the same highway as Plant One<br>
for Me and Elk Reserve in WY, they are still good.  One of my three Big<br>
Springs Boxes was dragged off by an animal, but it's marked in the clues<br>
now.  Big Springs is right on the road to Yellowstone if you are going in<br>
the West gate (in Island Park).  The Gem State letterbox is in a rest stop<br>
that can only be reached on northbound I-15 and there have been some times<br>
that the exit is closed due to construction.  So keep your eyes out if you<br>
are on the way, but don't go out of your way for now unless you have some<br>
extra time.<br>
<br>
Central:  If you have time to get out there, I am very proud of my Land of<br>
the Yankee Fork Series and the Sunbeam Springs and Dam Letterboxes that are<br>
near it are fun too.  They are near Stanley or Challis north of the Sawtooth<br>
Recreation area.  I think they are a great family stop because they are in<br>
old ghost mining towns and show you a touch of U.S. history.  I also did a<br>
few boxes around Salmon.  They weren't my best stamps, to be honest, but the<br>
area is pretty, especially if you drive a bit north of Salmon into the<br>
mountains.  In that area is also a box that was planted for Don and Gwen at<br>
the confluence of the Salmon River.  It is a ways out (I ran out of time and<br>
had to turn back) and Don and Gwen aren't sure it is still out there, if you<br>
try and it is, let me know.  There are a few other boxes that I haven't had<br>
time to find yet, but I believe they are still good.  Most of the Idaho<br>
boxes are pretty easy finds.  Letterboxing is relatively new here, so we are<br>
just beginning to get some of the more involved boxes.<br>
<br>
A-bear would be able to tell you more on the Boise area boxes.  She knows<br>
them better than I.<br>
<br>
Western WY: Don and Gwen's boxes should all be good still.  They are pretty<br>
recent and they don't usually make you hunt too far.  I have found Elk and<br>
Jackson's Elk.  Don't be too strict on the compass markings for Elk.  They<br>
didn't seem quite on to me, but we still found it easily and learned about<br>
wildlife in the area while we were at it.<br>
<br>
Make sure you check the mystery boxes in ID and WY.  You may want to contact<br>
Aryn (A-Bear) to see if she replaced hers.  The others are all still good<br>
and in interesting spots. I found the WY mystery box just a few weeks ago.<br>
You may want to research them while you are still home with a computer on a<br>
couple of the clues. They are easy once you know the general location.  I<br>
have been told that a certain lunar letterbox is a little tricky to decipher<br>
once you are there.  I haven't been out for that one just yet, but I hope to<br>
go very soon after I return from San Diego this weekend.<br>
<br>
I can't tell you much about the MT boxes yet or the other WY ones.  All the<br>
boxes I've found so far are family friendly and relatively simple.  You will<br>
have to let me know how it goes for you. Also, contact me off-list.  I have<br>
a few tips you might find helpful for some other boxes.  This has turned<br>
into a long email.  Let me know if I've missed any and I will be glad to let<br>
you know about them-it's late and I many have skipped a bit.<br>
<br>
Best of luck and enjoy your trip.<br>
Cadenza<br>
<br>
ps.  Here's the UT list too<br>
<br>
<br>
The Rings-easy, as clue states it's right off the highway, take stamping<br>
markers if you have them, it works better with the stamp. Rehide well as the<br>
location is a bit exposed.<br>
<br>
Golden Spike: historic box-1st in UT.  It's out of the way, but a very<br>
interesting location (at the spot where the world's first transcontinental<br>
railroad was joined-make sure you go out to the visitor's center).  I'm glad<br>
I have it.  Watch your step there are some snakes in the area.  I haven't<br>
heard of any biting incidents though.<br>
<br>
Kwagunogwai: Great park and a fun little spot. I may well have driven it<br>
wrong, but the driving instructions didn't leave me in quite the right<br>
place, but it was very close though and I found it by exploring a bit.  The<br>
box was easy to find once I realized that the downed tree on a corner of the<br>
trail wasn't the one the clue was speaking of.  Keep going as the clues<br>
direct and you will be able to tell you are in the right spot.  I only<br>
include this specific of guidance because I was able to find it without too<br>
much difficulty, but I know that Don and Gwen drove all the way out there<br>
and turned around in a spot just a few feet from the actual letterbox<br>
thinking they were leaving the end of the trail if they went further.  The<br>
spot they described as giving them some difficulty had also thrown me for a<br>
few, but once I pushed on, I found the spot clear as could be, just as the<br>
clue described.  (I hope I haven't given any spoilers here; I tried not<br>
to-Heather, if you're reading this, I loved your box.)<br>
<br>
A Walk in the Park:  Great walk, lovely park, and relatively easy finds.  I<br>
enjoyed this one quite a bit when I found it last month.  The added bonus is<br>
it is right in downtown SLC. You don't need a car to get there.<br>
<br>
Butterfield Canyon, Bingham Copper Mine, and Atoka are all my plants.  The<br>
first two were some of my earliest plants and stamps and I have had a couple<br>
people tell me that they felt a little nervous stopping for the mine box,<br>
but they told me they loved getting to see an interesting place they<br>
probably wouldn't have gone to otherwise and the box was probably alright<br>
for now.  There wasn't much traffic the day I went and security was all over<br>
the top, so I put it off the roadside and didn't notice that there were<br>
signs saying not to stop on the road.  You can get it in a moment though and<br>
not have though.  I think it's okay for now, but I may move it if I get a<br>
chance to go back out there.  I've been learning how to do better since!<br>
Butterfield Canyon is just a bit south of the mine entrance on the same<br>
highway that the mine entrance is on.  Atoka was a bit more recently done<br>
during a break at a training meeting I had.  The drive up Ogden Canyon was<br>
nice.<br>
<br>
I hear Teddy's waterhole is still there, but I haven't had a chance to find<br>
them yet.<br>
<br>
I think that hits the Northern UT boxes.  I hope this helps a bit.  Now I<br>
just need to head to the south.<br>

In Eastern ID, don't miss Mr. Potato Head and Gotta Go along with Let it<br>
Snow, while you are there.  The first two are a couple of my favorite stamps<br>
because they just make me smile. I had markers on the Mr. Potato Head and<br>
I'm so glad.  I liked it better with more than one color. Smiley Spud was<br>
still there when I found it a few months ago.  The hill winded me a bit<br>
since it was a little steep and I am sadly, sorely out of shape, but it<br>
wasn't far or hard to find-not my favorite stamp, but hey, I love any stamps<br>
in my book.<br>

Well, I am definately taking my long awaited vacation (it has been 3<br>
years)!!  I am headin to MT, WY, ID and possibly through UT.  If<br>
anyone out there has any info on the boxes in them parts, I would<br>

definately going to, so any and all boxes are a possibility.  My main<br>
