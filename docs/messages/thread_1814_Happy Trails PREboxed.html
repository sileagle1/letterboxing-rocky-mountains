The tone of the gathering was heartfelt and gentle and simply superb. It allowed us to remember Holly for exactly who she was, and both admire and forgive her for it. =3 It was a beautiful way to remember her, and her influence on Colorado boxing. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you, thank you to Dick and Peg. I have such admiration for your kindness. <br/>
<br/>
And thank you to everyone who shared their experiences with us. It was neat to get to know Holly through the eyes of the community.<br/>
<br/>
And, yes. We DO have a great time together. We have an exquisite community here in the Rocky Mountain Region. Fun and sweet and such creative souls. <br/>
<br/>
And I am humbly honored to be counted among you all. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I so wish that I had been able to be there. I was like any other beginner in Colorado and definitely had some trying times with Holly but I had good ones as well. And I simply cannot imagine coming home to her no longer being there. Her personality was larger than life and it will leave a gap that will be irreplacable. I am so glad you all got to gather and appreciate, forgive and remember Holly for all that she was. My love and respect was there in spirit.<br/>
