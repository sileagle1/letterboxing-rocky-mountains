                    <div class="plaintext-content">My wife (Love Bunny) and I (Baby Bear) just got back from a 3 day <br>
hiking and letterboxing tour in the upper Denver area.   We <br>
found "Grand Lake", "Shining Star", and "Wheel of the Year - Yule" <br>
boxes, and all are alive and well.   I also place 3 microboxes, and <br>
hope to have the clues posted this week.  Those boxes are:<br>
"The Rockies" - Estes Park at Mary's Lake<br>
"Rock Crawler" - Morrison at Red Rocks Park<br>
"Bear in Paradise" - Idaho Springs at Echo Lake (Near Mt Evans Rd).<br>
<br>
Had some rain, but still enjoyed being in the mountains.   <br>
<br>
PS - Grand Lake Lodge was closing that day, so will not be able to <br>
get to parking area.  You may be able to park at gate and walk in, <br>
or hike from town up to the box.   Next one there will get an extra <br>
bonus!!!<br>
