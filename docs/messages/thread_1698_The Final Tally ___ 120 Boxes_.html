a slightly less precipitous month will work better in the future, I'm still<br/>
thrilled with all the wonderful participation!<br/>
<br/>
Here's the down and dirty:<br/>
*  For Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Idaho - we have a total of<br/>
120 new boxes!<br/>
*  There are at least three new hitchhikers floating around out there, and<br/>
several new personal travellers have made their debut!<br/>
*  We had 18 sign ups for RMPAB Month, and several folks who weren't signed<br/>
up, but who contributed boxes to the region.<br/>
*  For one boxer, their plant for the month was their first plant ever!  Yay<br/>
for new boxers planting!<br/>
*  We had folks from outside the region contribute boxes to our fair<br/>
states!  Thank you!<br/>
*  We have several new "series" box sets planted, which always makes hiking<br/>
a trail a thrill!<br/>
*  The "month" was also responsible for 2 mini-meets and one workshop! Holy<br/>
cow for 20 folks meeting up in Utah!  (that's not such a "mini" meet!)<br/>
<br/>
Here's the new box breakdown (and of course, no way for me to count those<br/>
mysterious mystery boxes that may have appeared unbeknownst to us).  I may<br/>
be off by a few boxes here or there, so dont send your CPA after me.<br/>
<br/>
Colorado:  69 new boxes on AQ with another 1 on LBNA<br/>
Utah:  32 new boxes on AQ with another 2  on LBNA<br/>
Idaho:  2 new boxes on AQ<br/>
New Mexico:  8 new boxes on AQ with another 3 found on LBNA<br/>
Wyoming:  2 new boxes on AQ and another 1 on LBNA<br/>
<br/>
And what's cooler still?  Just in the first week of May, we've already had<br/>
more plants!  Whoop!<br/>
Thank you all for participating in my whim of an idea.  Anyone up for<br/>
May-ntenance month?<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
