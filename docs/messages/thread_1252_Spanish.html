catching up on all the clues this morning.  Don't have much to add <br/>
except that reading back over the clues, I noticed the one clue is how <br/>
do you say THAT is Spanish, not THIS.  So, that'd be "eso" without <br/>
the "t," I think.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few possible compass directions mentioned, that may bound <br/>
the area where it is: #12 - west of the golf course (?), #7 - east of <br/>
the "new German" (whatever that is?) and #2 - south of "West Derby" <br/>
(whatever that is - isn't there a carboard derby or something as part <br/>
of Snowdown?).<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that drew my attention is the repetition of "T", as in <br/>
clue #1 - ...T' AFT O' T" Map... and #12, "Tee" it up...  possible <br/>
interpretations could be roads that meet in a "T", golf tee, a tea <br/>
parlor, a giant letter "T" in a sign or something...<br/>
