No, you'll need to reread my post.  It was a cheaper set that I had<br/>
purchased previously that was worthless.  I'm very happy with Le Plume<br/>
and I'm going to buy a flesh colored marker in that same brand.  I'm<br/>
sorry that I wasn't very clear.<br/>
<br/>
Yoque is having nightmares about everyone making stamps that need a lot<br/>
of delicate coloring, so go easy everyone!  While Yoque retired his<br/>
journal, we still got three at our house!<br/>
<br/>
We need the information on the blending pen and the name of the store in<br/>
Denver and do you use a fairly big light magnifier ... the kind that<br/>
clips on the table?  How long before departure to that far off land?<br/>

I just bought a set of those Le Plume markers that you have, Silent <br/>

opened them up.. should I take them back for something else?!  Because <br/>
now I'm determined to make the mermaid in living color.  And I want to <br/>

but I got it at Guirries (sp) in Denver.  I just went in and <br/>
described it and they led me right to it.  It was with all the <br/>
colored markers and is thick (the size of an original magic marker) <br/>
and the tube and cap are black.  I'll pull it out and look at the <br/>
name tomorrow when I'm home. <br/>

I use a magnifying lamp that I found at Hobby Lobby that clamps on <br/>
the table.  Awesome.  It's sweet.  Lucky!  Ooops.. sorry.  <br/>
<br/>
Okay...that's what I get for reading posts with too little sleep.  <br/>
I'll keep the le plumes!  woot!<br/>

Es, who wants Yoque to know that he can stamp any and all of her <br/>
stamps in one color any time.. as long as he can distract SW long <br/>
enough to do it :::laughs:::<br/>
