I know we have a bunch of mystery buffs on this list. Do any of you read<br>
Newboxers? There's a mystery going on there with that Investigator Bacon<br>
who did the PZKut mystery last year. This time he's been hired by Emily<br>
Post (I thought she died a long time ago) to find Missing Good Manners.<br>
Anybody have a clue as to what's going on?<br>

Eidolon, you're right about the crossposts on LBNA, too.  I checked it<br>
out there as well and found several posts that were not on Newboxers.<br>
<br>
Including our own Y-nought!!!<br>
<br>
How could that surly pretend-detective dare accuse the Rocky Mt Mr<br>
Manners?  The swine (get it? Bacon?) has been in your garbage, for sure,<br>
Y.  Good reply on your part in your own defense!  Can DragonRider be far<br>
behind?  Next we'll sic those Splendid Buccaneers from Palisade on him!!<br>
He would never dare show his piggish face in the Rockies!<br>

That's what I think! We've got more etiquette out here than Bacon can <br>
handle. <br>
<br>
Plus, we stick together, as demonstrated by Dragonrider when he backed <br>
me up. I would be more upset with Investigator Bacon if it wasn't so <br>
dang much fun telling him off.<br>

Holy !  Now they've got Eidolon sucked into this mystery, too.  Anyone<br>
