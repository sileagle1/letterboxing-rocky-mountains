                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the pictures Silent Wings and fellow photojournalist!  I was <br/>
able to switch the last two like you wanted...I'm not a moderator, but <br/>
I think since it was in a "book" I started, it let me switch them.  I <br/>
love Nimbus's pumpkin carving!  How cool is that!  I bet he can make a <br/>
mean Gingerbread house too!<br/>
<br/>
Would love to see pics of the new puppies both SW and Boxrlvr have!  <br/>
They need to meet Ravenwolf's puppy...he looks tall and daunting, but <br/>
was a sweetheart at the gathering!<br/>

Hugs, Peach<br/>

Seriously Judy, I don't know why there was any problem. We still have <br/>
plenty of space in the photo area. I went through and confirmed your <br/>
triple high level clearance setting. So you might want to just try <br/>
again. This is the second time I've had to type this message, so it <br/>
might just be another cyberglitch in YaHooland.<br/>
<br/>
I want to see what Paisley looks like! And the new Catamount puppy too!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Silent WIngs for the awesome pics!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome Amy!<br/>
<br/>
y-nought, who is grateful for our easily manageable 7 inches of snow <br/>
(gorgeous!), and excited about La Paloma's very first White Christmas.<br/>
