Well I AM a Trekkie and I've heard of a lost episode but I haven't <br/>
seen it yet. Although, if we are talking about the same thing, I <br/>
wouldn't call it "lost" so much. More like it went "underground" for <br/>
a little while.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully I'll get a chance to see it soon. <br/>
<br/>
I've also heard rumors that while some people find it funny, others <br/>
just think it's dumb. I'm glad to hear that Es and JeLy are in the <br/>
first group (I suspected as much).<br/>
<br/>
y-nought, who watched "Grease" last night and laughed when they <br/>
said, "Peachy Keen Jelly Bean" (because I'm easily entertained too).<br/>
