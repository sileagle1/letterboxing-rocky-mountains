                    <div class="plaintext-content">funhog, I'm so sorry!  I did get your email asking me to check on <br>
this, and I just haven't been able to.  I even have a little empty <br>
log book in my pack just for Rain Cloud!  But things have been so <br>
hectic, and I just haven't had the energy for a hike of that caliber <br>
recently.<br>
<br>
If anyone is planning on helping funhog out with this letterbox first <br>
aid, can you also check on Litha - my box that is on the same trail?  <br>
I had a report that it was missing.  I'm always dubious, because I've <br>
had at least five reports like this, only to discover that it is, <br>
indeed, alive and well - just tricky to find, or had been moved by a <br>
geocacher (once, and they were kind enough to email me new <br>
coordinates), and etc. you get the idea.<br>
<br>
So if you can get up to Dakota Ridge trail near Red Rocks, this would <br>
be awesome.<br>
<br>
Much obliged,<br>
Autumn<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Funhog!  Grammy Peach would be happy to change the baby!  We live <br>
nearby and your box was one of our early finds.  In fact, a storm was <br>
coming in and it started to rain (perfect memory for the Rain Cloud <br>
box), so we stamped in and literally ran down the hill to the Morrison <br>
Inn and quenched our thirst with a margarita...(I was thinking to <br>
myself that I should know better, being a Colorado native, and not be <br>
on high hills during storms...but, letterboxing does the strangest <br>
things to your mind!  Ha!).  We would be happy to lend an assist!  <br>
Contact me off list and we can make arrangements.  <br>
<br>
Autumn, I will also be happy to check on Litha!  Email me off list too <br>
and let me know what all you want me to do.<br>
<br>
Happy Fourth of July!  Looking forward to RenFest!<br>
<br>
Hugs, Dixie Peach<br>

Refresh my memory - can I get to this box with my 2 and 4 year old?  I live<br>
minutes from Dakota Ridge.<br>
