Hi Kathy--<br>
     Your friend that solved the Onion just told me bad news. It <br>
seems that the Open Space folks were working with some equipment and <br>
squashed the Onion before they realized it was there. I am supposedly <br>
going to get a call from a Ranger tomorrow. <br>
<br>
     I understood that the logbook was nearly full and you can <br>
believe I am crossing my fingers that they still have that. I was <br>
planning on replacing that book soon, I already have another one <br>
ready, and was looking forward to seeing all of the stamps.<br>
<br>
     But for the time being, THE ONION IS ON SABBATICAL, until I can <br>
replace it. I may also have to tweak the clues a little. <br>
<br>
     I will keep you all posted. And thanks for all the interest in a <br>
silly little letterbox.<br>
<br>

Noooooooooo!!!!<br>
<br>
I have to admit that it's cool that they took the time to notify you <br>
and not just toss it.  I sure hope it's okay!! Let us know!<br>
<br>
Es, who can't even imagine how it got squished<br>
