Hi Kathy--<br/>
     Your friend that solved the Onion just told me bad news. It <br/>
seems that the Open Space folks were working with some equipment and <br/>
squashed the Onion before they realized it was there. I am supposedly <br/>
going to get a call from a Ranger tomorrow. <br/>
<br/>
     I understood that the logbook was nearly full and you can <br/>
believe I am crossing my fingers that they still have that. I was <br/>
planning on replacing that book soon, I already have another one <br/>
ready, and was looking forward to seeing all of the stamps.<br/>
<br/>
     But for the time being, THE ONION IS ON SABBATICAL, until I can <br/>
replace it. I may also have to tweak the clues a little. <br/>
<br/>
     I will keep you all posted. And thanks for all the interest in a <br/>
silly little letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
       y-nought<br/>

Noooooooooo!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit that it's cool that they took the time to notify you <br/>
and not just toss it.  I sure hope it's okay!! Let us know!<br/>
<br/>
Es, who can't even imagine how it got squished<br/>
