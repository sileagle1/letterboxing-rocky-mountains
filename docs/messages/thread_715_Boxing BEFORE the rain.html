clues before I go out and realize its not posted anymore---was it pulled or missing?)<br/>
Obviously I didnt find it. I had fun looking tho-knew I must have been in the right area ..just gotta love those vague clues of yours JelyBean.  But did find Maggie from there anyway.  What a beautiful hike and area.  And the stamp!!!<br/>
<br/>
Then on Sun very early before the rain I went to Ute Pass.  I cant believe you did that without<br/>
a flashlight Dixie!!  That was a great hike...we came down on our butts-it was quicker and easier-sort of fun too.  Just gotta love letterboxing...I would have NEVER known about that place and have passed it dozens of times.  I camp 3 miles from there several times each summer.<br/>
I noticed that it was place on July 4 2004, JelyBean, did you go to the Manitou 4th of July<br/>
music and craft festival the day you placed it?  I was there...had 2 booths.<br/>
<br/>
I think I already mentioned that I finally went to the Onion about 10 days ago.<br/>
<br/>
Now to pick my little brain for that Big Brain Box....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, sorry Tie Dye Gal, the butterfly was stolen some time back.  I <br/>
usually don't replace stolen boxes because I figure the stealer may <br/>
come back to the same spot.  I've been tossing around the idea <br/>
lately of maybe putting it back in another spot, because I love that <br/>
little park, but we'll see.  I have some others I want to do first.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you enjoyed Ute Pass, that's one of my favorites.  Wasn't <br/>
at the Manitou festival, though, but if I had known you were there I <br/>
would have made it a point.<br/>
