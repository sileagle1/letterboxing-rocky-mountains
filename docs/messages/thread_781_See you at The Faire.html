You must have done some fancy shenanigans to be able to come.<br/>
<br/>
The gathering will be at Twelve Noon on Sunday, July 24. We will <br/>
meet inside the Colorado Rennaissance Festival gates, just up the <br/>
hill at a statue. They won't let us bring pie, but we can buy <br/>
eclaires and other goodies inside the castle.<br/>
<br/>
If there is anyone reading this that wants to exchange stamps but <br/>
not go into the faire, PLEASE POST HERE when you will be there. I <br/>
think it is safe to say that we are all letterbox stamp fanatics, <br/>
and it really would be no big deal to get our hands stamped to join <br/>
someone outside for a meet and ink.<br/>
<br/>
This is just over a week from now, so I'm starting to do a few happy <br/>
dances a day.<br/>
