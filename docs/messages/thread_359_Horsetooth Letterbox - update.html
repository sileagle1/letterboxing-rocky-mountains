                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi again - so I heard back from the Larimer Parks guy who pulled the <br/>
Horsetooth Letterbox.  He seems very interested in writing a <br/>
letterboxing policy for the park, and is considering replacing the <br/>
box.  He will have to write and get approval for the new <br/>
letterboxing policy (I don't know the details of it), and I'm unsure <br/>
of how long it will take to do this.  Meanwhile, my little box is <br/>
sitting in an office in Loveland somewhere...<br/>
<br/>
Truth be told, I was a little dismayed about the possibility of an <br/>
XPlore article about letterboxing.  There aren't too many <br/>
letterboxes in Fort Collins (not too long ago there were NONE), and <br/>
I would hate to see them disappear!  Especially the "For Cattail" <br/>
box!  I do know, however, that Miles (the reporter who made the <br/>
original inquiry to Esmerelda) is one of their best writers, and I'm <br/>
sure he would do an excellent job explaining the ins and outs of the <br/>
game IF they were explained to him.  So Carrie, if you haven't <br/>
already done so, I think it would be the best thing if a seasoned <br/>
LB'er contacted him for an interview.  I would be happy to <br/>
participate, but I am now in San Diego :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'll keep you guys posted on the Horsetooth letterbox, and <br/>
the clues on the LBNA website have been modified to show its current <br/>
status.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
