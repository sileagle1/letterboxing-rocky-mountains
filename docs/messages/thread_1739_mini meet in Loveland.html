Ok we just signed up.  I put in the notes that we will try our hardest to make it.  Our summer has been crazy and it just won't slow down.  I am going to stick it on the calendar and hope it doesn't get crowded out with last minute school stuff and the like.  We are looking forward to meeting some of the other letterboxers in our area.  We have never been to one of these before.  <br>
