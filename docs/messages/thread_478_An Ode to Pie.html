My childhood movie treat was Flicks (Fliks?)...the chocolate wafers <br>
that came in a foil covered cardboard tube.  <br>
<br>
Those were the days, my friends.<br>
<br>
Es, having old pirate flashbacks to the good old days<br>
<br>
p.s.<br>
Here's a link to a coolio candy place that sells retro-candy.  I <br>
found it one day while hunting for Flicks on the internet (just how <br>
sick is that?).  No Flicks, but I found a long-ago treat eaten by <br>
the young Skeech of days gone by.  And there was much rejoicing.  <br>
They have your wax bottles and candy papers, JB. <g>  Is this a <br>
great country or what?<br>
