My childhood movie treat was Flicks (Fliks?)...the chocolate wafers <br/>
that came in a foil covered cardboard tube.  <br/>
<br/>
Those were the days, my friends.<br/>
<br/>
Es, having old pirate flashbacks to the good old days<br/>
<br/>
p.s.<br/>
Here's a link to a coolio candy place that sells retro-candy.  I <br/>
found it one day while hunting for Flicks on the internet (just how <br/>
sick is that?).  No Flicks, but I found a long-ago treat eaten by <br/>
the young Skeech of days gone by.  And there was much rejoicing.  <br/>
They have your wax bottles and candy papers, JB. <g>  Is this a <br/>
great country or what?<br/>

&gt; Can it be true that y-nought is not familiar with those red gummy <br/>
&gt; strawberry flavored vaguely fish-shaped delights we used to get at <br/>
&gt; the movies as kids?!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course, I always prefered the wax soda bottles filled with <br/>
&gt; colored sugar water.  Then again there were those colored sugar <br/>
dots <br/>
&gt; that came on a piece of paper and you always got little bits of <br/>
&gt; paper in your mouth...<br/>

&gt; &gt; What in the world is swedish fish? Can it really be better than <br/>
&gt; pie?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, I'm more partial to ice cream or swedish fish than <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pie, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I understand that pie is like the "food of the gods" to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pirates!<br/>
