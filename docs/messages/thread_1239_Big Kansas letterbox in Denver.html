Hey boxers-<br>
<br>
Does anyone know anything about the Big Kansas letterbox in Denver?  I <br>
found it listed on the LbNA site, and it sounded kind of cool - the <br>
clues are in the form of a mp3 file.  But, when I clicked on the <br>
download site, I got an error page.  I e-mailed the placers about a <br>
week ago but I have not heard back from them.<br>
<br>
Does anyone know if this box is still active and, if so, where I can <br>
get the clue?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
Amy<br>

With the current weather we've had "forever" in Denver, it'd be <br>

I apPREciate the info - it is certainly not urgent,<br>
and cen definitely wait until the frozen tundra we now<br>
live on thaws out.  My feeling is that you are<br>
probably right about the page being taken down because<br>
the box is gone.<br>
<br>
By the way, I am planning to look for Ex Libris<br>
tomorrow. :)<br>

I accessed the Big Kansas website around Christmas. I scribbled down all the clues, but then opted to hunt for Pre's Skatepark and Open Doors boxes instead. I could transcribe my notes for you, but at the rate we're going with the snow and arctic temps, it might be, oh, next summer or so before you could hunt (unless you have an ice pick, some snow shoes, and a lot of time...)<br>

That's a kind offer!  If you wouldn't mind, that would<br>
be great.  But of course, it isn't urgent, given the<br>
fact that we now live on an icy tundra that is, it<br>
seems, permanently frozen.  <br>
<br>
If you are desperate for a boxing fix, Pre's Ex Libris<br>
is both indoors and really cool.<br>

Thanks for the tip!  I got the mp3 that way - so Amy,<br>
if you haven't already started transcribing your<br>
notes, I probably won't need them.  Now, if only this<br>
snow would go away so I could go and look for it...<br>
