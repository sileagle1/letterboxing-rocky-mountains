retired.  How could I let Valentine's Day pass without re-planting the <br>
Valentine's inspired Hot Pants.  The carving is just like the original <br>
however, the clues have changed (same park  new location) and there is <br>
a very special Limited Edition Glow-In-The-Dark LTC for the first 2009 <br>
visitor.  A reminder that since this park was finally updated it is a <br>
very popular place to visit.  Stealth is necessary when nabbing this <br>
box.  This is my third replacement of the Hot Pants box.  The LTC was <br>
too large to fit inside the box.  It is in a very small zip lock on top <br>
of the box. <br>
