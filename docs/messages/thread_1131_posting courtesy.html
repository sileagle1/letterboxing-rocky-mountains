                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a reminder that it can be very helpful to cut out non-pertinent parts<br>
of replies to posts.  I have started using the daily digest now that Yahoo<br>
finally made it easy to respond to individual posts.  If I want to scroll<br>
through the whole digest, I have to go through TONS of repeated information<br>
that I've already read.<br>
<br>
If your email program automatically copies replies, can you just cut out<br>
some of the extra stuff and save the list and our email accounts a lot of<br>
extra text?<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>
Cadenza<br>
<br>
just to give you an example, I'm including the text of a recent thread.  I<br>
don't think we realize how long they get sometimes when you are only reading<br>
the beginning.  All of this extra stuff was for a five word reply.  Now, I'm<br>
not pointing fingers because we've all done this.  I still want to hear the<br>
replies.  It would just help to not have all the extra stuff with it.<br>
