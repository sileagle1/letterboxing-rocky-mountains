Wow, I received some really impressive sinature stamp images from <br>
Jodie that are going to be traveling with us next month overseas.  <br>
If you'd also like to show yours off to the UK letterboxing <br>

I am also still looking for hitchhikers that you'd like to send a <br>

Still wishing I knew where the wings fluttered off to so they could go along.  *sigh*  oh well.<br>

Let us know how we can add our stamps.  Also, how soon would you need<br>
hitchhikers.  I've got one in mind, but it needs to be crafted.  If we<br>
put our minds to it, we could get it done.  The Catamount Carvers tend to<br>
be a little slow.  We travel slowly, we put letterboxes together VERY<br>
slowly, and in general, we live life a bit slower than the average<br>
American.<br>
Your upcoming trip sounds GRAND!  Before kids, we actually travelled<br>
about the world for 11 months.  We're so happy we did it, because lots of<br>
people postpone those ideas ... and of course, it never happens.<br>

Hi Catamount Carvers.  Thanks for adding to the fun, I think it'll <br>
be cool to leave a log full of US stamps over there.  Please email <br>
me off-list and I will give you details.  My email address: <br>
