<br>
On the heels of that last post, I have a question for y'all.<br>
<br>
Aljan and I were commenting the other day on how folks ask us how we do <br>
what we do. What are our techniques? How do we come up with ideas? What <br>
materials do we use? And there are plenty of you out there that I would <br>
like to ask those very same questions.<br>
<br>
Is anyone interested in a workshop? Don't ask me when, this is a very <br>
preliminary idea, but if we all got together, brought our carving, <br>
stamping, book making stuff, and we can do demos, and answer each <br>
others questions?<br>
<br>
I never mind answering questions about how I do what I do. I know we <br>
are all striving to do bigger, better things with our art, and if I can <br>
help foster anyone's ideas, I'm all for it! <br>

I wonder if these aren't two distinct ideas.  A workshop intended <br>
for people who already have some experience with letterboxing but <br>
want to improve their carving/logbook making/etc would probably <br>
cover very different ground than a workshop for folks who already <br>
have the artistic part down but know nothing about letterboxing.  I <br>
think that doing both in a single event would be tough.<br>
<br>
I think that there's probably room for both, but I'm not convinced <br>
that they should be combined.<br>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think this is a great idea....<br>
<br>
I would love to learn from the pros....and would be happy to help in <br>
any way I can...<br>
....a couple of ideas for whomever is taking notes:<br>
<br>
1) I've noticed some medium that seems to be twice the thickness of <br>
other medium...what is it?<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Lesson on cammo bags, Tai Chi, please<br>
<br>
<br>
3) Log book making...some are absolutely fantastic, just beautiful.  <br>
Ideas would be great for us less than creative folk.<br>
<br>
<br>
4) Home made journals...Es how did you do our book bindings?<br>
<br>
<br>
5) Why won't the magnetic tape I bought work worth squat...do you <br>
need special sized magnets to hold an altoid box in place?<br>
<br>
<br>
6) Has anyone tried making home made paper for a logbook?<br>
<br>
<br>
7) Technique...I've notice that many carvers make thicker lines on <br>
their stamps...I'm having to recarve some of my stamps that are <br>
tearing.<br>
<br>
<br>
8) Reverse negative images?  Say what?<br>
<br>
<br>
9) Do's and don'ts for letterboxing etiquette, e.g. what not to talk <br>
about at an event and other formal tie affairs.<br>
<br>
10) Stamp backing, what works, what doesn't<br>
<br>
My mind's a whirl with the possibilities....<br>

the Pros from Dover.<br>

Uh... depends on which one you got.  I used three different methods <br>

Is it white? Probably MasterCarve. You used to be able to find it at <br>
Hobby Lobby.<br>
<br>

Absolutely. Lots of questions about that one.<br>

<br>
Magnets come in different 'degrees' if you will. The magnetic tape I <br>
find doesn't 'hold' very tightly. You can find magnets that hold <br>
together so tight, you almost can't get them apart. Check the local <br>
craft stores for magnets with a higher 'rating'.<br>
<br>
 <br>
> 6) Has anyone tried making home made paper for a logbook?<br>
<br>
Yes. Here is the problem with handmade paper: While it is very, very <br>
pretty, it is also very fiberous. Ink tends to bleed into the paper <br>
badly, and it leaves a poor image. Cardstock is great. It is thick <br>
enough that you can stamp on both sides without bleedthrough, and <br>
it's not too thick to work with. If you want to know more about <br>
homeade paper, I would be happy to share! =3<br>
 <br>
 <br>

<br>
Hmmm... Tearing how? Do you back your stamps onto anything? Can you <br>
post a pict?<br>
<br>
> 8) Reverse negative images?  Say what?<br>
<br>
Did you ever exchange with Autumn when she had her first siggy stamp? <br>
That was a reverse or negative image. It is where the actual image <br>
doesn't stamp. You cut it out of the material, leaving most of the <br>
material behind. Ack. Does that make sense? I'll see if I can post a <br>
couple of images...  <br>
<br>
