You know, the very BEST place to take your kick-ass stamp would be to <br/>
the Grand Junction area.  Those boxes are just crying out, weeping <br/>
and gnashing their teeth for another kick-ass stamp.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sittin' here in Phoenix after a seriously awesome visit to the <br/>
Magic Kingdom with my favorite daughter.  No stopping for boxes on <br/>
the road...there just wasn't time. I'll be flying home tomorrow <br/>
(unless the planes are full) and rejoining the world of the infamous <br/>
mountain state letterboxers.  <br/>
<br/>
Es, perking at the constant snacks and endless movies on the Disney <br/>
Floating Snackateria<br/>
