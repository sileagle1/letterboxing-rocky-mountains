I am making a call for Lord of the Rings letterboxes!  As some of you <br/>
know we have our own Mt. Doom here in Western Colorado high atop <br/>
Grand Mesa.  There are currently 7 lovely boxes there done by <br/>
assorted lovely boxers.  <br/>
<br/>
We would love (we being me) to add more boxes!  Aside from the fact <br/>
that, hey, come on, Lord of the Rings letterboxes, sweet!, we would <br/>
like to be able to fill in the 'holes' between the existing boxes <br/>
making them all easier to find.  Not to mention more tempting.<br/>
<br/>
It's a very safe location, far off the beaten trail.  No chance of <br/>
them being found accidentally.  I will watch out for them and do <br/>
maintanence.  It will be your creation, your plant.  I'll find it a <br/>
perfect home and send you the directions so you can post the clue.  <br/>
<br/>
We have:<br/>

The Preciousss (Golum)<br/>
Goldberry<br/>
Tom Bombadil<br/>
Screaming Orc<br/>
Ringwraith<br/>
Faramir, Prince of Ithalian<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
