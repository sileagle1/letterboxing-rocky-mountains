Kenna gets off the river from Desolation Canyon late that day and I'll <br/>
be finished mid-day. So close, but so far away! Summer is just not <br/>

By the way, I am not receiving any of my e-mail from the <br/>
letterboxing.org site. So, if you've tried to e-mail me from there, and <br/>
I haven't responded, my sincere apologies. I'm not trying to be rude - <br/>
I swear. Does anyone else have this problem?<br/>

If you actually want me to write you back, please try e-mailing me <br/>
directly. *sigh* Thanks everyone!<br/>

This is sounding better all the time!<br/>
<br/>
As far as having a plan......The Noughts will be there all day, so it <br/>
doesn't really matter to me. But it might work out better for those <br/>
driving from further away to wait until 1:00 PM for the meet-up. I <br/>
would suggest that we meet at the picnic tables between Castle Rose <br/>
Stage (Ded Bob) and Wishing Well Stage. This is where we ended up last <br/>
year and those of us that get there early can kind of stake a place out <br/>
for those arriving later.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to carve a quicky stamp this week, but I'll give fair <br/>
warning....it isn't going to be quite as fine and funky fresh as <br/>
Esmerelda's was last year. I just looked at that one again today and I <br/>
still can't believe it!<br/>
<br/>
So, these are my suggestions. But by all means, if anyone out there can <br/>
only make it if it is earlier in the day (or later), or if they have a <br/>
better idea of where to meet up, let us know so we can get as many <br/>
people meeting as we can.<br/>
<br/>
Woot! I can't wait!<br/>
