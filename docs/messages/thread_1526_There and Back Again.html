And I have good news from Durango. First....The Animas Overlook Road <br/>
has melted out and is open (Woot!). And second......if anyone tries for <br/>
Three Keys and sees the area taped off for construction, do not be <br/>
deterred. The letterbox is still in place just inches from the <br/>
scaffolding! As  long as the construction workers don't discover it, it <br/>
can still be nabbed after hours by a skillful 'boxer.<br/>

you're in luck today' and handed me TEN boxes of donations for the <br/>

<br/>
I am constantly amazed at the skills of all you incredible boxers out <br/>
there.  Wow. Those of you coming are in for a treat.  And those of you <br/>
not coming should rethink that! Arrrrr!<br/>
<br/>
Rest up your stamping muscles.<br/>

Es, wondering who the heck is gonna plant all of these.. <br/>
