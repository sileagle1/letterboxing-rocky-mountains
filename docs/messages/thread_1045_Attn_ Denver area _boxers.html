<br>
You don't mention if you've boxed in the Front Range area before, so <br>
apologies if you've done these already...<br>
<br>
In addition to your Westminster idea (I happen to have a series of 2 up <br>
that way called Eagle Eyes....) I think you could get some good bang <br>
for your boxing buck in both the Golden and Morrision areas.  Wrong <br>
side of town for DIA, but some great hiking and boxing in fairly small <br>
areas.  Both would be pretty straight shots from DIA on Highway 6.<br>
<br>
If you happen to find yourself near central Denver, let me know.  Maybe <br>
we can do an exchange.<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>
