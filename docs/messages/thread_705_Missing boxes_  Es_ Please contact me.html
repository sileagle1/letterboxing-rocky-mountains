Tipi Trek at the Plains Conservation Center was pulled when the tipi <br/>
hiding it went down and it has not been replaced yet.  The other 2 at <br/>
this same location are fine and the workers there are planning to <br/>
replace Tipi Trek soon.  Also a warning about Kiwi Camping in Cherry <br/>
Creek State Park which is missing.  Bird and Berry are still fine.  <br/>
Es, please contact me off line in regard to Kiwi Camping and 2 other <br/>
boxes that need attention.  I hope everyone is enjoying the 3 day <br/>
weekend.<br/>
