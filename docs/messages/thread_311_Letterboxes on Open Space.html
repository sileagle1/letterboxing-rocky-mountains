<br>
I wanted to forward along this email I got from Colleen at Jeffco this<br>
morning.<br>
<br>
Hope it helps!!<br>
<br>
PS - I was looking at Jeffco Open Spaces website yesterday... It does<br>
talk about th special activity permits.  There is a fine of $45 if you<br>
do not have one.  <br>

It sounds like all these locations are within Open Space.   As long as<br>
the locations are not in sensitive areas or areas with seasonal<br>
closures, they will most likely be approved.  I think it would be fine<br>
to put multiple boxes on one permit and the permits are free.  The<br>
process to obtain a permit is to call 303-271-5925 and request a permit<br>
application.<br>
