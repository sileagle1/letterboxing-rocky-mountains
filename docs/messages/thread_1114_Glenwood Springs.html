                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Preboxed - we want to thank you for a hike up to the mine!  My <br>
little sister is in Denver on business and had called yesterday to see <br>
if we wanted to meet halfway for supper.  So, Glenwood it was.  <br>
My son printed out a couple of boxes to find, but we only had time for <br>
one.  <br>
Yes, we did see the marmot heading up the hill, poking around in what <br>
looked to be washing machines or some sort of trash.  The kids were <br>
pretty excited and we loved looking, but not touching, the mine. <br>
I have to say though, my dh was pretty sure we were going to be <br>
arrested for going on mining company property.  It was pretty funny, <br>
and he was the first one back to the truck with our 2 year old on his <br>
shoulders!  <br>
What an adventure, we're going back for the Riverwalk box!  and the No <br>
Name box!!<br>
Also, it was our first time being FF!  And our first hitchiker!  <br>
Yeah!  We are soooooo hooked!<br>

So glad you liked it.  And I might note, there is NO sign on that <br>
gate saying it's prohibited to enter, so I (and the marmot) figured <br>
it was fair game for a box!  That view alone is worth it.....<grins><br>
<br>
Congrats and thanks - both for finding my box, and for the report.<br>
<br>
It's so easy to get hooked.<br>

We hit it in the evening and everything was glowing red on the opposite side <br>

red.<br>
Thanks!<br>
