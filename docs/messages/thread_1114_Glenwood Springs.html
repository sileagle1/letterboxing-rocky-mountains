little sister is in Denver on business and had called yesterday to see <br/>
if we wanted to meet halfway for supper.  So, Glenwood it was.  <br/>
My son printed out a couple of boxes to find, but we only had time for <br/>
one.  <br/>
Yes, we did see the marmot heading up the hill, poking around in what <br/>
looked to be washing machines or some sort of trash.  The kids were <br/>
pretty excited and we loved looking, but not touching, the mine. <br/>
I have to say though, my dh was pretty sure we were going to be <br/>
arrested for going on mining company property.  It was pretty funny, <br/>
and he was the first one back to the truck with our 2 year old on his <br/>
shoulders!  <br/>
What an adventure, we're going back for the Riverwalk box!  and the No <br/>
Name box!!<br/>
Also, it was our first time being FF!  And our first hitchiker!  <br/>
Yeah!  We are soooooo hooked!<br/>

So glad you liked it.  And I might note, there is NO sign on that <br/>
gate saying it's prohibited to enter, so I (and the marmot) figured <br/>
it was fair game for a box!  That view alone is worth it.....<grins><br/>

Congrats and thanks - both for finding my box, and for the report.<br/>
<br/>
It's so easy to get hooked.<br/>

We hit it in the evening and everything was glowing red on the opposite side <br/>

red.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
