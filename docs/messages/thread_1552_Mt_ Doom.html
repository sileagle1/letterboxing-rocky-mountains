If you are one of the wonderful people who are donating stamps for the <br/>
mountain/event, I'm ready to head up there and get them planted.  If I <br/>
can get them all in my hands in the next week, I'll be on track.<br/>

Please get in touch with me if you need my address!<br/>

Since I tore my knee a few days ago, I definitely won't be doing any commercial hikes <br/>
during any of the gatherings this summer, yay to that, but boo to no more fun hikes for a <br/>
while, :(<br/>

If you could mail it that would be awesome.  I've still got so much to <br/>
do and feel the time slipping between my fingers!  I've got a little <br/>
pile of boxes all ready to go in their shiny new lock and locks and a <br/>
bunch more coming.  If all of the promised boxes show up you all are <br/>
gonna get carpal tunnel in your stamping fingers.  Woo!<br/>
<br/>
Which means, the sooner I can get them all the better!<br/>
<br/>
So much to do.. so little time!  Argh!<br/>
