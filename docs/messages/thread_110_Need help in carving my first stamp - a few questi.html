                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am trying to carve a stamp for my daughter.  I have the design on the<br/>
rubber, but I am unsure how to proceed in carving so that all the<br/>
details show up... <br/>
<br/>
I am carving an elephant... How do I make sure his eyes, tusks and ear<br/>
(it's overlapping his body) show up and don't get lost when I use it as<br/>
a stamp?<br/>
<br/>
This stamp is a SMALL one... it is 1x1", so needless to say, I need to<br/>
make sure my carving is detailed... I know - I should have started with<br/>
a bigger stamp, but hey, I am one for challenges!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
