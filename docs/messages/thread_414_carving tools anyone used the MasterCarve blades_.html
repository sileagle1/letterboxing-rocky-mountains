Having just bought some new blades and finding all of them dull and<br>
uneven I was forced into sharpening them. <br>
It went better than I expected.<br>
I used a very fine grit sandpaper, the black kind, not sure the number<br>
rating but as fine as it gets.<br>
I mostly sharpened the outside but I did the inside too by curling up<br>
the sandpaper and running it along the inside towards the sharp part.<br>
The good news was that they were sharper than when I started but I<br>
still feel bummed to buy new blades that are duller than the ones that<br>
I am trying to replace.<br>
I have seen ads for blades made by MasterCarve. Has anyone tried<br>
those? I have not seen them in any of the stores I go to.<br>
Good Luck,<br>

I have the set of Mastercarve tools.  I only use the largest one for <br>
scooping out big chunks..the smaller sizes seem really dull and <br>
difficult to use.  It may be just this particular set that I have, <br>
but I'm not going to buy another to find out!<br>
<br>
I'm going to try the sandpaper trick when I get home.. thanks for <br>
the ideas, guys!<br>
