Rattlesnake (looks good by the way - thanks Debbie!)<br>
and then on a whim, we decided to go and do some maintenance on the <br>
Alchemist's Lizard, as we haven't been there since we put the box <br>
out. Lo and behold, as we are sitting there cleaning up the box a <br>
little, a brand new boxer - Katie - and her mother show up hunting <br>
our lizard! This was their 3rd box - Beltane and Ostara being their <br>
first couple. They read about the hobby in Time Magazine very <br>
recently and had decided to check it out. They were thrilled to sit <br>
and talk with us for a bit about the in's and out's of our little <br>
hobby. We exchanged stamps, and headed on our respective ways.<br>
<br>
We just found it extremely cool to have been in the same spot, at the <br>
same time. We invited them to come check out the RM Letterboxing <br>
group, so hopefully we will see them here soon.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's awesome. I can just picture a meeting in the Lizzards grotto.<br>
<br>
Fantabulous here too! I cannot imagine that heaven is more beautiful <br>
than it was at 11,000 feet stamping into Esmerelda's Wings of Eagles <br>
letterbox. The aspens were ablaze with orange and yellow and there <br>
was some snow on the higher peaks. And the stamp and journal were <br>
magnificent!<br>
<br>
I also dropped a guy named Jack-in-the-Green off at Animas Overlook <br>
on the way home. This makes three boxes, all by different people, on <br>
this wheelchair accessible path with amazing views. <br>
<br>
These are the good ole days.<br>
