I did a double take myself when I saw the title of that post......but then I found out that THE Ringo Starr of the Beatles has a new album out called Y-NOT!<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, I hope I have time to find the Silver Bullet AND do some much needed box maintenance now that I will be involved in an international copyright infringement case.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, even though I have been quiet for a while, I still check up on my absolutely favorite group from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers to Peach for giving Ringo the warning.<br/>
<br/>
And tears to blackvelvetrav for losing so many sweet letterboxes...so very sorry to hear about that.<br/>

I haven't heard one clue this year and I don't even know if the Silver Bullet has been found yet,,,,,but I would imagine it has been by now.<br/>

I wasn't even able to dig our trebuchet out for the Cat-A-Pult contest today.<br/>
