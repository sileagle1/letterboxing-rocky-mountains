In my opinion, an Aljan design is always on topic!<br>
<br>
This is an especially good tidbit for me - I am participating in the <br>
Race for the Cure on Oct. 5 (here's my Race Center if you wanna <br>
contribute to the cause: <br>
http://www.komendenver.org/site/TRC/Race/General?<br>
pg=center&fr_id=1070).  I have a colleague who has been battling <br>
breast cancer for some time, so I always participate in this event.  <br>
This year, I would love to wear one of these.  I will definitely be <br>
watching for this, and it goes without saying that I will pin my <br>
number on the non-Aljan side.<br>

My father, sister and I have also been volunteer firefighters and I was a volunteer ECA for a while many years ago.  I would love to purchase a shirt when they are available.

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
