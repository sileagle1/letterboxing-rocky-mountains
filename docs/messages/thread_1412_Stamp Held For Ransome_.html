                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, here's a new one! This morning I went up to Corona Arch to do maintenance on the <br>
"Layers" 4-box series (my favorites). In box #1, the stamp was gone and someone left the <br>
following message: <br>
<br>
" I have found your stamp and it is safe with me. I will return it next year possibly. To <br>
whomever may find this note I am a traveller who is running out of time. Every year that <br>
passes I fall deeper into debt and soon will I will no longer be able to travel / This note will <br>
bring good fortune and health to you and everybody you know! If you could help me My <br>
name is Joe. 847-971-6703<br>
<br>
At the bottom he wrote his phone number so I can "help him". How totally bizarre is <br>
that!!!!<br>
It is written on a notepad from a Kinko's in Illinois. I would say to that thief, get a job, pal!<br>
<br>
Box #2 was totally gone and will have to be recarved and rehidden in a new spot. Box #3 <br>
was still there, but hidden about 20 feet away from where it should be!<br>
<br>
I also did maintenance at the "Moabman" letterbox and someone has taken one of the <br>
stamps out of that box also.<br>
<br>
I also checked on the "BMAO in Moab" box by Pre. Pre, your box is fine and in great shape <br>
with about 1/2 the journal still empty!<br>
<br>
Lulu & Ticaboo boxes were still in their spots, but that canyon flashflooded so hard last <br>
weekend that it is unrecognizable and the clues will have to be rewritten. Lulu box had <br>
been underwater, but was wedged in the crack so well with rocks that she survived the <br>
flood! Thanks for rehiding well H-A's, you were the last to stamp in. <br>

Whew, what a morning!!!<br>

  That definitely is a north side Chicago phone number (having lived there before).<br>
  I can't even imagine what this person wants...  someone to send him ransom money to get the stamp back?!?!?<br>
  Is anyone thinking of calling this nut?  I have a really morbid curiosity as to what he wants.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
