This isn't an exclusive list - just a list for folks who might be interested<br>

Will do.  I suspect many of the posts will not really apply to me, but this is the closest any have come.  I do consider myself as being part of the Rockies (being a stones throw from Yellowstone, the Tetons, and others) but there just aren't others out here yet.  Luckily a few have been kind enough to come this way and leave some plants.<br/>
<br/>
The thing that appeals to me about this group is being able to communicate with others who understand not only the terrain, but what it is like to be a "lonely letterboxer."  I have to huff a bit when I see posts complaining about only finding 15 of 20 boxes they looked for that day, or things like that.  When I started here, there weren't that many boxes in my whole state, and considering the fact that you could fit many of the eastern states into one state out here, that's a lot of territory.  I love reading their emails, but it is a whole different perspective when I still have to travel hundreds of miles to get to boxes that I didn't find in my first week (there were two in the east half of ID).  It is getting better, but it will be fun to know<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm rambling a bit-sorry! (:  I'll end now.  See you all later, and if anyone is interested in coming to Idaho this weekend, let me know.  We'd love to have more for our letterboxing cookout.<br/>

I'll write later, but there are some fun, easy UT boxes.  The trick is that those that I know at this point are closer to I-80 than 70.  Let me check some stuff out and get back with you.<br/>
