<br>
Due to mechanical problems, we didn't get to do as much boxing as we <br>
wanted to, but we did manage to snag several very nice ones.<br>
<br>
Both 'Elk', and 'Big Elk' in Jackson - these look great and have seen <br>
many visitors.<br>
<br>
'Buffalo Wings' in Cody - the debate rages on!<br>
<br>
And one in the Big Park itself. Lovely stamp, well worth the effort <br>
to find.<br>
<br>
We attempted to locate the box in Thermopolis, but it appears to be <br>
missing. =(<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who placed these stamps. It made the trip more <br>
worthwhile.<br>
<br>

beautiful here, isn't it?  If you make it again, you will have to <br>
hunt down some of the new boxes I planted before.  I'm pretty pleased <br>
with them.  They are all in close proximity to the area.<br>
<br>
Did you list all the ones you found?  I'm a little curious, b/c I can <br>
think of several easy boxes that run between the ones you named.  It <br>
get's crazy with time sometimes, but there are some fun boxes in this <br>
region.  I have checked on most of them within the last two weeks <br>
(from ID to Jackson and Cody).  I'd be happy to pass on any status <br>
for those who are planning trips.<br>
<br>
till later,<br>
