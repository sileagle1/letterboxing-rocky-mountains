Oh, the agony of it all! Drove to Lake Powell to bring the boat home <br>
for winter, and went right by "The End of the World" box. Daughter <br>
didn't feel well and so we couldn't hike up there and claim our <br>
treasure. The horrible feeling as it was calling down to me, don't <br>
leave, don't leave. Soon, I'll come back soon, I called back.<br>

Awwww, and such a nice day too. Oh well, I think that one will last a <br>
while up there. I'm sure you two will get a chance to talk to each <br>
other again.<br>
