                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey I know that there is a site for Letter Box rings and I have already <br/>
posted there.  I was just thinking that maybe some of you snowbound may <br/>
like a letterbox in the mail.  My husband and I are starting this ring. <br/>
    We have a few more spots available and the more the merrier.  If you <br/>
have never participated in a postal letter box now may be the time.  <br/>
We've done a few and have found it to be almost as good as a birthday <br/>
party.  Happy Boxing!<br/>
<br/>
PS Esmeralda, I am sure that there just has to be a pirate comic book <br/>
out there somewhere.  I'd love to see one of your log books in this <br/>
ring. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Look in the mailbox<br/>
<br/>
Its a bird<br/>
<br/>
Its a plane,<br/>
<br/>
No its a  New Comic Book PLB Ring<br/>
<br/>
The Flying Javalinas have decided to start a new PLB Ring.  We love <br/>
comic books and feel that there must be a few others on the list who do <br/>
too.  This is not limited to comicbook geeks.  We would love to  share <br/>
some fun books with newbies too.<br/>
<br/>
Easy Rules:<br/>
#1 Each person would create a box with a logbook and stamp with a comic <br/>
book theme.<br/>
<br/>
#2 Each box would contain a copy of your favorite comicbook.  Please <br/>
dont send an original Action Comics #1  :-)  These will be read and <br/>
passed on for all to share and then returned to you.  Please keep them <br/>
PG rated.<br/>
<br/>
#3  The box must not cost more than $3.85 + delivery confermation to <br/>
send.  The USPS flat rate envelopes are a perfect size.<br/>
<br/>
#4  You may include special items or information as long as you keep it <br/>
within mailing costs.  You can allow others to stamp in them.<br/>
<br/>
#6  You must keep the turn around time to under 3 days.  Really, how <br/>
long does it take to read a comic book?<br/>
<br/>
#7  To be eligible you must be one of the first 15 to send us <br/>
notification of what comic book you will be mailing out.  (We dont <br/>
want everybody to send the same Spiderman book.)<br/>
<br/>
#8 The first round of boxes will be sent out by February 9th.<br/>
<br/>
This will be more fun than the San Diego Comic Book Convention!<br/>

I will add a Wolverine (Does he have his own or is he strictly an X-Men character?  ...see, told you!).  ...already have a freshly carved Spidey stamp for my little boy that would love to team up with his fellow super heros.  Sign me up for a Wolverine!<br/>
