more time off to Y...really really soon please? dear Nick (tis OK if I <br/>
call you Nick if Life gave me This First Name - Right?)<br/>
<br/>
In exchange could I please have about 6 months off (ok the rest of my <br/>
life....) paid of course!? - to go on road trips, carve stamps/write <br/>
clues, right and "make stuff" ....plus take a trip to the Four Corners <br/>
area? all W/O snow!<br/>
<br/>
So many rocks, so LITTLE time, and so much snow/cold weather...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

whew!! OK, it's in the 60's there and I'm not quite ready for all this <br/>
COLD STUFF! Because Nuboy, Aspen, and I are spoiled and buy each other <br/>
presents all year, at Christmas we just give big, fat anonymous <br/>
donations to our local food bank and humane society (we're getting <br/>
near to having enough donations to build a shelter). I love the <br/>
letterbox gift ideas. Last year I gave Kennamtn everything she needed <br/>
to be a star at boxing, and we've had sooooo much fun since then!<br/>
<br/>
We just got home from the backcountry with our Christmas tree, and we <br/>
saw the biggest, most gorgeous bobcat I've ever seen out there! He <br/>
looked like he was going to have a good holiday!<br/>
<br/>
I think rather than ask for a brain, I should ask for a better <br/>
attention span (I swear sometimes I've got adult ADD) so I could just <br/>
sit and read that encyclopedia!!!<br/>

&gt; stamps for some <br/>
&gt; &gt; friends and boxed them up with a journal and some<br/>
&gt; ink pads.  Also <br/>
&gt; &gt; included a FAQ sheet and clues to our boxes. <br/>
&gt; They've always seemed <br/>
&gt; &gt; intrigued by our hobby, so we thought we'd nudge<br/>
&gt; them a little.<br/>
