clues, right and "make stuff" ....plus take a trip to the Four Corners <br>

whew!! OK, it's in the 60's there and I'm not quite ready for all this <br>
COLD STUFF! Because Nuboy, Aspen, and I are spoiled and buy each other <br>
presents all year, at Christmas we just give big, fat anonymous <br>
donations to our local food bank and humane society (we're getting <br>
near to having enough donations to build a shelter). I love the <br>
letterbox gift ideas. Last year I gave Kennamtn everything she needed <br>
to be a star at boxing, and we've had sooooo much fun since then!<br>
<br>
We just got home from the backcountry with our Christmas tree, and we <br>
saw the biggest, most gorgeous bobcat I've ever seen out there! He <br>
looked like he was going to have a good holiday!<br>
<br>
I think rather than ask for a brain, I should ask for a better <br>
attention span (I swear sometimes I've got adult ADD) so I could just <br>
sit and read that encyclopedia!!!<br>
