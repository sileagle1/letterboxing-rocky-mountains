<br>
I think it's a great idea to have a backup system for clues, and that <br>
Autumn has done a nice job of respecting the sensitivity of the <br>
authors. It's also true that clues change alot, so it may be an <br>
impossible task to do by hand using Word documents, especially as the <br>
Rocky Mountain letterboxing community expands. That's the reason LbNA <br>
went to the "new" website. The manual work was overwhelming. For <br>
years, people posted their actual clues to the yahoogroup and then <br>
the webmasters cut-and-pasted them into LbNA files. Poof! Archive on <br>
yahoogroup. I still occaisionally search the group archives for old <br>
clues. Now with the "announce" group, less and less people post their <br>
clues to the big list. Too bad, really...<br>
<br>
There is an unofficial experiement on an alternative similar to <br>
Autumn's idea over at the big list (letterbox-usa at yahoogroups dot <br>
com). The link is below. It's a database that gives only the <br>
yahoogroup message number, not the whole clue. So you could post your <br>
box in a message to the big list the old fashioned way and then enter <br>
a database item to make it easier to find. If you edited the clues, <br>
you would just re-post a message to the group and then change the <br>
database link.<br>
<br>
Not to say that the yahoogroups archives will last forever, either, <br>
but it's probably better than a big file of paper clues.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to sound ominous or anything, LbNA is a long term <br>
project with committed people behind it, but you never know. Nothing <br>
wrong with being prepared!<br>
