I don't think the problem is with your monitor. It's another case of <br/>
me seeing things that are a bit of a stretch (sort of like peaches <br/>
turning into pirates, Bwah!) for most other folks. I asked Elros to <br/>
try and make the mountains more obviously resemble letters and I <br/>
think he did a pretty dang good job.<br/>
<br/>
Please have a look at RMPatch Take Two in the files and tell me what <br/>
you think.<br/>
