<br/>
I have been as busy as a beaver carving some fun Nightmare Before <br/>
Christmas images and a few other surprises along the way.  <br/>
<br/>
We will be having Taco Soup, Cornbread and some Halloween sweets for <br/>
lunch.  I do have ice tea on hand but if you have a favorite beverage <br/>
(hot or cold) please bring it along.<br/>
<br/>
We will eat, do exchanges and such at the house and then head out into <br/>
the wilds with special clues for the boxes that I have created.  I <br/>
will also be printing clues to any of the boxes that may already exist <br/>
near the newly planted boxes.  I will be posting the Nightmare Before <br/>
Christmas boxes on both Atlas Quest and Letterboxing.Org.  However, I <br/>
will not reveal the actual clues to the boxes to the general <br/>
letterboxing community until after our Gathering.<br/>
<br/>
See you soon!!!  Blackvelvetrav    <br/>
