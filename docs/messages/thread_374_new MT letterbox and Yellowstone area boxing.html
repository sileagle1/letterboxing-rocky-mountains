Sorry, I haven't been on the list to find this question.  I hope you <br/>
found the box (thanks for the compliments, by the way.  I am very <br/>
proud of that stamp).<br/>
<br/>
A good note is that if you are headed up this way, to remember that <br/>
Yellowstone covers parts of MT, ID, and WY.  Don't forget to look at <br/>
other states.  For instance, the Chief Joseph box you asked about is <br/>
only about 10 minutes from West Yellowstone, MT, but is located in <br/>
Eastern Idaho.  If you go just a few miles into the park (the other <br/>
direction) you are in Wyoming.  There are quite a few boxes outside <br/>
of the parks in various states, if you just look in all the spots.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoyed your trip!<br/>
