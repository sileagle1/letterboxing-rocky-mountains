I'm relatively new to letterboxing, but not to stamping.  I will be <br/>
attending a STampin' Up! convention in Salt Lake City tomorrow thru <br/>
Saturday and leaving on Sunday.  Won't have a car but would like to <br/>
letterbox while there.  Are there any letterboxes near the convention <br/>
center that I could walk to or is any one going to be available <br/>
Wednesday night or at a momoent's notice for letterboxing in the <br/>
evening?  Will have my lap top and cell so can communicate either <br/>
way.  Please email me first: tgouraud@austin.rr.com.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you and happy boxing,<br/>
