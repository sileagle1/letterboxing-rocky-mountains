Fellow Denver, CO area letterboxers--<br>
<br>
We are fortunate enough to get to spend a 4 hour layover in <br>
Denver's <br>
Airport (DEN) on 18 May.  If anybody would like to meet us <br>
somewhere <br>
in/around the United Terminal in Denver's airport from 5-7pm <br>
we'd <br>
love to try to link up to exchange signature stamps.  Please <br>
contact <br>
us off list to try to coordinate something.<br>
<br>
It would be nice to link up with any area letterboxers if it would <br>
work out.  We may even have a letterboxing 'treat' for any folks <br>
who'd like to participate.  Please contact us prior to the evening <br>
of 10 May to coordinate it.<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>
<br>
dvn2r ckr, rnrB & trkr<br>
DuPont, WA<br>
