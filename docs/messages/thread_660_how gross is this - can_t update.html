I'm expecting to have to pull the Enginerd box today, but I can't log <br/>
in to the LbNA site.  Well, technically, it will let me fill in my <br/>
login name and password without giving me an error, but once I've <br/>
submitted that info, I can't do anything in Member Services.  This <br/>
means I can't post any new boxes or update existing ones.  Anyone else <br/>
having this problem?<br/>

&gt; Got an email this morning letting me know that one of my placed <br/>
&gt; letterboxes had apparently been used as a urinal.  I'm not looking <br/>
&gt; forward to picking it up, but I suspect everything but the stamp <br/>
will <br/>
&gt; be tossed and replaced.  Can't imagine anyone will want to stamp in <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; yellow-stained pages.  I'll have to find a better hiding spot, too.  <br/>
&gt; Can't imagine this was an accident as the box was in a ziploc and <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; contents of the box were also in ziplocs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First Lemony, now this...<br/>

I've seen several notes on the main board about people having this <br/>
problem.  It seems to have come up after they switched servers.. <br/>
same thing on Atlas Quest.  I hope they fix it soon.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have any problem getting in.  I'm not sure why it's some <br/>
machines or isps and not others. <br/>
