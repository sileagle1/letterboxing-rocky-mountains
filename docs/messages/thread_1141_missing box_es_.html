<br/>
My Denver Skatepark box is definitely missing, probably the victim of <br/>
the torrencial rains about 10 days ago.  I'll try to replace it this <br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
I have a report that Cha-ching Cha-ching might also have a problem.  I <br/>
can see there might have been some gardening there recently, but <br/>
haven't had a chance to see if the box got gardener-ified too.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh the "joys" of urban boxes....<sigh><br/>
<br/>
Will update LbNA, as appropriate.<br/>

<br/>
Cha-ching, cha-ching has in fact been munched up by gardeners.  I <br/>
checked out the location this evening also and found what I think will <br/>
be a much better hiding spot for this sneaky box.  Since it's so close <br/>
to where I work, I hope to have a new box carved this weekend, and <br/>
will replace it early next week.<br/>

mood...)<br/>

Have fun! at Inkuisition tommorrow to everyone who's going.  I'm sorry <br/>
I can't make it.  I haven't been feeling great lately and need to beat <br/>
this crud.<br/>

this date.<br/>

I also made the actual hiding spot easier to get to at more times of <br/>
day/week, and less likely to be found by gardeners (I hope!)<br/>
