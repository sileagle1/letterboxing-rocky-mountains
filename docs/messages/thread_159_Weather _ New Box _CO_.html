SoC#2: Hairstreak Butterfly<br>
Placed by: JeLyBean   (contact the placer)<br>
Placement date: Feb 14 2004<br>
State: Colorado<br>
County: El Paso <br>
Nearest city: Colorado Springs<br>
Number of boxes: 1<br>
<br>
Clues<br>
Symbols of Colorado #2: Hairstreak Butterfly. The state insect of <br>
Colorado, the Hairstreak is a native insect found here and in other <br>
areas of the Southwest. The caterpillars emerge in spring and <br>
develop on oak leaves, particularly Gambel Oak (Quercus gambelii). <br>
The adults appear beginning in June and can be seen throughout <br>
summer. They are easily identified by the characteristic <br>
slender "tail" protruding from the hind wing and by their beautiful <br>
coloration: upper sides of the wings are purple with a wide dark <br>
border and orange spots on the outer edge of each wing. The <br>
Hairstreak may typically be found amongst oak thickets.<br>
<br>
Terrain: Easy. Less than two miles round trip over mostly level <br>
paths. Some easy climbing to the box.<br>
Clues: Fairly easy.<br>
<br>
Directions: Reach Ute Valley Park by taking the Woodman or <br>
Rockrimmon Exits off I-25. Follow Rockrimmon to the intersection of <br>
Vindicator and head west. The parking lot for Ute Valley Park will <br>
be on your left past the school.<br>
<br>
Clues: Hit the boards, all right? Wind around the hill and take the <br>
only trail just for hikers. Walk for a while. When you get to the <br>
appropriate spot, make like a troll. Lean against the right side and <br>
take a compass reading of 94*. Up through the evergreen branches, <br>
you may see a place that's just a hole in the wall. Of the several <br>
choices, the upper is preferred by butterflies. Still missing it? <br>
