Ok, I'm tightening my shoelaces and heading out the door. I have the <br/>
feeling you might beat me there, but that's ok because I ALWAYS <br/>
enjoy seeing the Y &amp; Co. stamps. I am planning on heading that way <br/>
the week after Christmas though, so if you were to plant another one <br/>
out there somewhere, (hint hint hint), it would make the trip doubly <br/>
fun! hehehe<br/>

It's a little closer to me than it is to you, but you still might <br/>
beat me. I am doing some stretching exercises and I've already <br/>
started carbo-loading, so we'll see. <br/>
<br/>
As far as planting another one goes........I have to finish <br/>
wassailing before I can start carving again.<br/>
