Message #834 contains some text from a person named Michele Spalding <br/>
who lived in Boulder. Her website still has a letterboxing page from <br/>
1999. She was supposedly going to plant one in 1999 but the link to her <br/>
clue never worked.<br/>
<br/>
Messages #3828 and #3834 are Jay Drew and Mapsurfer talking about <br/>
Michele Spalding as well as other early letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
And message #4726 is from Brooks/Devere announcing the letterboxes he <br/>
placed in Arizona, Texas and Colorado the summer of 2000.<br/>
<br/>
This might be boring to some people, but I just love reading those old <br/>
messages from when it was all brand new.<br/>
