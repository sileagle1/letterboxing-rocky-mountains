I'd be right now if I'd posted this idea on that other talk list.  <br/>
Thanks for all the positive responses.<br/>
<br/>
I've got nine parties expressing interest right now, which feels <br/>
about right.  That was, after all, the number of that other, lesser-<br/>
known fellowship.  I don't want this to get too big because at some <br/>
point it starts to feel like just open sharing of clues.  So, I'd <br/>
like to cut off membership here, unless you have a really really <br/>
reeeeally good reason why you had't responded earlier and are <br/>
offering a substantial bribe.  Perhaps if there are more folks who <br/>
are interested, we'll break into two competing groups and see who <br/>
can solve it first.<br/>
<br/>
For the folks who have already responded, if you haven't emailed me <br/>
off-list, please do so at jelybean "at" adelphia "dot" net so I can <br/>
capture your email address.  Once I have everyone's, I'll send out a <br/>
note and we'll take this discussion off-list.<br/>
