Recipe.  In case you are not familiar with these items:<br>
<br>
Shoepeg corn is a variety of white sweetcorn valued for its sweetness. <br>
It is characterized by small, narrow kernels that form uneven rows on <br>
the cob.  I have always found the corn in my local Albertson's store <br>
in the canned vegetable isle.<br>
<br>
Rotel Tomatoes are a Brand of canned Tomatoes:  http://www.ro-<br>
tel.com/pages/index_flash.html<br>
<br>
I am sure you could substitute items if you do not have the exact <br>
ingredients.  The beauty of this recipe is it is easy and flavorful.<br>
