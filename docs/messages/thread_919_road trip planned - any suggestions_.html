Re: Ogden/Promontory<br>
<br>
Along with some other RML boxers, I've been working with DerMadStamper<br>
on his Golden Spike letterbox near Promontory UT. CW Sun Seeker and I<br>
tried to locate it and it seems the National Park Service changed the<br>
marker numbers on the Big Fill Trail! So that the referenced marker<br>
number in the clues no longer exists. I have located the letterbox and<br>
emailed DMS with the new information so he can re-write the clues. I<br>
suggest you wait until the last minute to print out this clue sheet.<br>
This is a good letterbox and I recommend you look for it if DMS has<br>
revised the clues before you leave for OR.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you've checked out the LBs on LBNA and AQ for the UT counties<br>
you'll be passing through. There aren't that many of them. I've heard<br>
that the 2 that Frank&Nadine have in Weber County are missing, but the<br>
others are OK as far as I know. If you need help with county<br>
identification along your route, let me know. Also if you'd like to<br>
meet for a stamp exchange while you are in Ogden, contact me offlist<br>
at jowagnon at comcast.net.<br>

The Promintory box (oh yeah and the park...) were absolute "must <br>
dos" on my trip.  If I did no other box in UT, that one was gonna be <br>
it, so that is VERY helpful.<br>
<br>
I'm up to 3 notebooks full of clues, and 4 states of printed county <br>
maps, and my Rand McNally atlas is nearly worn out from thumbing <br>
through it plotting out the route with boxes along the way and I <br>
haven't even left yet! (geographer mildly obsessive with <br>
maps ...hehe)<br>
<br>
Will reprint DMS clues this Wed before I leave town, and make a note <br>
that the Weber county ones may be MIA...since they were on my "maybe <br>
list."<br>
<br>
<goes off list for follow up with a few posters>.<br>
<br>
The thing about vacations is they're so much WORK to get the heck <br>
outta town, they you "pay for it" once you get back...I haven't been <br>
able to get back on this list since I originally posted....<br>
<br>
oh well.<br>
<br>
Thanks to EVERYONE whose been kind enough to repond!<br>

If DMS doesn't get the clues changed on the Golden Spike page in time<br>
for you to print it before you leave, I don't think he would mind if I<br>
help you out. Let me know.<br>
<br>
The Big Fill Trail is good. It's cool to actually be able to see some<br>
of the construction elements. There's a booklet at the trailhead which<br>
points out the significance of the info markers. And it doesn't take<br>
too long. Unfortunately the NPS has stopped the re-enactment of the<br>
Golden Spike ceremony for the season - where they bring out the 2<br>
locomotives to meet head to head. One of the do-it-yourself car tours<br>
is still open though, and, if you collect the NPS cancellation stamps,<br>
they have that there along with 2 extra stamps.<br>
<br>
I thought of another box which is probably missing in my area. I<br>
think it's clue page indicates that. It's Utah or Bust GFCS #2 in<br>
Davis County, just south of Ogden.<br>

is interesting and there are some outdoors exhibit items. I enjoyed the<br>
trail that Golden Spike is on. It isn't too hard of a hike at all. Keep an<br>
eye out for snakes though, although I don't think they should be too much of<br>
a problem this time of year.<br>
<br>
There is also an interesting outdoor exhibit of rockets and space shuttle<br>
stuff on the road out to GS. Follow the signs. It is a tiny bit out of the<br>
way, but can be fun if you are into that stuff. I am a bit of a space<br>
junkie, so I liked it.<br>
<br>
Let me know if you head up around Idaho Falls. I would be happy to point you<br>
toward any of the Eastern Idaho boxes and most of the central ID ones. Hope<br>
you enjoy the trip!<br>
