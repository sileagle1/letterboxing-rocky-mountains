Re: Ogden/Promontory<br/>
<br/>
Along with some other RML boxers, I've been working with DerMadStamper<br/>
on his Golden Spike letterbox near Promontory UT. CW Sun Seeker and I<br/>
tried to locate it and it seems the National Park Service changed the<br/>
marker numbers on the Big Fill Trail! So that the referenced marker<br/>
number in the clues no longer exists. I have located the letterbox and<br/>
emailed DMS with the new information so he can re-write the clues. I<br/>
suggest you wait until the last minute to print out this clue sheet.<br/>
This is a good letterbox and I recommend you look for it if DMS has<br/>
revised the clues before you leave for OR.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure you've checked out the LBs on LBNA and AQ for the UT counties<br/>
you'll be passing through. There aren't that many of them. I've heard<br/>
that the 2 that Frank&amp;Nadine have in Weber County are missing, but the<br/>
others are OK as far as I know. If you need help with county<br/>
identification along your route, let me know. Also if you'd like to<br/>
meet for a stamp exchange while you are in Ogden, contact me offlist<br/>
at jowagnon at comcast.net.<br/>

The Promintory box (oh yeah and the park...) were absolute "must <br/>
dos" on my trip.  If I did no other box in UT, that one was gonna be <br/>
it, so that is VERY helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I'm up to 3 notebooks full of clues, and 4 states of printed county <br/>
maps, and my Rand McNally atlas is nearly worn out from thumbing <br/>
through it plotting out the route with boxes along the way and I <br/>
haven't even left yet! (geographer mildly obsessive with <br/>
maps ...hehe)<br/>
<br/>
Will reprint DMS clues this Wed before I leave town, and make a note <br/>
that the Weber county ones may be MIA...since they were on my "maybe <br/>
list."<br/>

The thing about vacations is they're so much WORK to get the heck <br/>
outta town, they you "pay for it" once you get back...I haven't been <br/>
able to get back on this list since I originally posted....<br/>
<br/>
oh well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to EVERYONE whose been kind enough to repond!<br/>

If DMS doesn't get the clues changed on the Golden Spike page in time<br/>
for you to print it before you leave, I don't think he would mind if I<br/>
help you out. Let me know.<br/>
<br/>
The Big Fill Trail is good. It's cool to actually be able to see some<br/>
of the construction elements. There's a booklet at the trailhead which<br/>
points out the significance of the info markers. And it doesn't take<br/>
too long. Unfortunately the NPS has stopped the re-enactment of the<br/>
Golden Spike ceremony for the season - where they bring out the 2<br/>
locomotives to meet head to head. One of the do-it-yourself car tours<br/>
is still open though, and, if you collect the NPS cancellation stamps,<br/>
they have that there along with 2 extra stamps.<br/>
<br/>
I thought of another box which is probably missing in my area. I<br/>
think it's clue page indicates that. It's Utah or Bust GFCS #2 in<br/>
Davis County, just south of Ogden.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have gone out to Promontory out of season too and still had fun. The trail<br/>
is interesting and there are some outdoors exhibit items. I enjoyed the<br/>
trail that Golden Spike is on. It isn't too hard of a hike at all. Keep an<br/>
eye out for snakes though, although I don't think they should be too much of<br/>
a problem this time of year.<br/>
<br/>
There is also an interesting outdoor exhibit of rockets and space shuttle<br/>
stuff on the road out to GS. Follow the signs. It is a tiny bit out of the<br/>
way, but can be fun if you are into that stuff. I am a bit of a space<br/>
junkie, so I liked it.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you head up around Idaho Falls. I would be happy to point you<br/>
toward any of the Eastern Idaho boxes and most of the central ID ones. Hope<br/>
you enjoy the trip!<br/>

&gt; &gt; The Promintory box (oh yeah and the park...) were absolute "must<br/>
&gt; &gt; dos" on my trip. If I did no other box in UT, that one was gonna be<br/>
&gt; &gt; it, so that is VERY helpful.<br/>

&gt; If DMS doesn't get the clues changed on the Golden Spike page in time<br/>
&gt; for you to print it before you leave, I don't think he would mind if I<br/>
&gt; help you out. Let me know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Big Fill Trail is good. It's cool to actually be able to see some<br/>
&gt; of the construction elements. There's a booklet at the trailhead which<br/>
&gt; points out the significance of the info markers. And it doesn't take<br/>
&gt; too long. Unfortunately the NPS has stopped the re-enactment of the<br/>
&gt; Golden Spike ceremony for the season - where they bring out the 2<br/>
&gt; locomotives to meet head to head. One of the do-it-yourself car tours<br/>
&gt; is still open though, and, if you collect the NPS cancellation stamps,<br/>
&gt; they have that there along with 2 extra stamps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I thought of another box which is probably missing in my area. I<br/>
&gt; think it's clue page indicates that. It's Utah or Bust GFCS #2 in<br/>
&gt; Davis County, just south of Ogden.<br/>
