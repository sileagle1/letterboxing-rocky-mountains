Box On The Rocks - 2005, Moab, Utah<br/>
<br/>
Date: Sunday, April 10, 2005<br/>
Location: Rotary Park, Downtown Moab<br/>
Time: 2:00 - till whenever, maybe early evening?<br/>
What: Exchanges, maybe a little box hunting, lot's of laughing and <br/>
chatting, and did I mention pie???<br/>
<br/>
Bring a picnic lunch and beverage and join us! I think everyone is <br/>
excited to finally meet each other and it is an awesome place to <br/>
visit! I will organize some desserts for everyone after their <br/>
lunches and we'll go from there!<br/>
<br/>
Rotary Park: Unfortunately, no dogs are allowed in this park. It is <br/>
a nice green oasis with lots of trees and grass to relax in. Lot's <br/>
of playground equipment and the kids can just run!!!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; From Main St., head east to 400 East. Turn right when 400 East <br/>
&gt; deadends and drive until you see Dave's Corner Market. Turn east <br/>
&gt; here on Millcreek and drive a little ways up the road. You'll see <br/>
&gt; the park on your right. You can also follow the signs to the <br/>
&gt; Slickrock Bike Trail. It is farther up this road. There are <br/>
&gt; restrooms, picnic tables, bbq pits, and some water available.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are many boxes now in Moab, so plan to spend some time and <br/>
do <br/>
&gt; some boxing while you are here! There is even a box series planted <br/>
&gt; in this park already!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you can join us, please post how many are in your group, so we <br/>
&gt; have a rough idea of how many people are coming. I'm excited, it <br/>
&gt; sounds like we have at least fifteen and hopefully more coming.<br/>

ps. CW Sunseeker, where are you guys located at now?  Are you back in<br/>

early, we could caravan.  Same goes for Mt Walker or others in the<br/>
area.  I'm thinking I will try to head down on Sat (if I'm not too<br/>
tired, so I can get some boxing done before).  I'm not sure if I will<br/>
camp or get a room somewhere.  We'll see.<br/>

CW Sunseeker?!  Ramdelt?! I sure hope you folks can make it. This is <br/>

Let me make it official and say wild horses couldn't keep me away. <br/>
I'll be there with my two sons Dark Side of the Moon and Elros. They <br/>
are excited to finally put faces with stamp images too.<br/>
<br/>
We will be camping on Saturday night. Probably up at the Sevenmile <br/>
Canyon Primitive sites off of highway 313. And we will probably be <br/>
heading up the Portal Trail on Sunday morning for those boxes, <br/>
(although we could be persuaded to hike up Negro Bill canyon or <br/>
Hidden Valley where there are also some boxes that I need to get). <br/>
<br/>

Woo Hoo!  I'll be there!  Just me; husband has to work; grown kids<br/>
have little interest in their mother's games. :-P  <br/>
<br/>
I am surprised the rest of you haven't met face to face.  You sound so<br/>
familiar with each other in your posts.  I am the lucky one to be so<br/>
new to this hobby and get to meet lots of folks right away.<br/>
<br/>
I still need to check out the Bullfrog area for a motorcycle<br/>
rendezvous later in April, so will be leaving Ogden a couple of days<br/>
early to do that.  Will probably get into Moab on Saturday before the<br/>
big gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Kat and y for putting this together!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">y-nought, tell me more about this camping spot, how many boxes are in<br/>
the area and how long any hiking might be for them.  My back is<br/>
sometimes funny with long hikes in the early season.  I need to work<br/>
up to them.<br/>
<br/>
I have a brand new tent that I hope to christen on this voyage.  I am<br/>
excited b/c it is my first tent of my own.  I've always borrowed big<br/>
ones from my family before.  It was a fun treat for me to find this<br/>
one. Two person and light--should be perfect for a trip I'm planning<br/>
in June.  It is just what I was looking for and would you believe it<br/>
is currently set up in the empty bedroom of my two bedroom apt b/c I<br/>
just couldn't wait until spring to see how it worked?<br/>
<br/>
You said the camp was primitive.  How primitive?  Would I need to be<br/>
hauling water on a hike to get there and be able to stay, or is it<br/>
just one of those not made for RVs places.  I also want to utilize my<br/>
time to find as many boxes as I can that morning.  I haven't been able<br/>
to get down south very often.  I don't know if I should look at other<br/>
camp sites.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts anyone?<br/>
Cadenza<br/>
<br/>
ps.  I just thought of something.  I have a friend that I dragged<br/>
along to go boxing in the Yellowstone/Island Park area last year who<br/>
seemed into the boxing a bit.  I wonder if I could talk her into<br/>
coming down too.  Her schedule is busier than mine, but she does have<br/>
a stamp and everything already.<br/>

-------------- Original message -------------- <br/>
y-nought, tell me more about this camping spot, how many boxes are in<br/>
the area and how long any hiking might be for them.  My back is<br/>
sometimes funny with long hikes in the early season.  I need to work<br/>
up to them.<br/>
<br/>
I have a brand new tent that I hope to christen on this voyage.  I am<br/>
excited b/c it is my first tent of my own.  I've always borrowed big<br/>
ones from my family before.  It was a fun treat for me to find this<br/>
one. Two person and light--should be perfect for a trip I'm planning<br/>
in June.  It is just what I was looking for and would you believe it<br/>
is currently set up in the empty bedroom of my two bedroom apt b/c I<br/>
just couldn't wait until spring to see how it worked?<br/>
<br/>
You said the camp was primitive.  How primitive?  Would I need to be<br/>
hauling water on a hike to get there and be able to stay, or is it<br/>
just one of those not made for RVs places.  I also want to utilize my<br/>
time to find as many boxes as I can that morning.  I haven't been able<br/>
to get down south very often.  I don't know if I should look at other<br/>
camp sites.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts anyone?<br/>
Cadenza<br/>
<br/>
ps.  I just thought of something.  I have a friend that I dragged<br/>
along to go boxing in the Yellowstone/Island Park area last year who<br/>
seemed into the boxing a bit.  I wonder if I could talk her into<br/>
coming down too.  Her schedule is busier than mine, but she does have<br/>
a stamp and everything already.<br/>

The camping area on highway 313 is NOT the most centrally located for <br/>
letterboxing. We just like it because you can get some privacy, and <br/>
there are usually some spots open. It is "primitive" in that there <br/>
are no restrooms or dumpsters.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestions would be, (and Kat would know better so she might jump <br/>
in here): <br/>
<br/>
Highway 279 heading west between Arches NP and Moab there are a <br/>
couple of campgrounds. Jaycees is pretty nice and private but usually <br/>
full, and there is one further down by the river that is wide open <br/>
camping on a sandy beach by the River with few trees. From this road <br/>
you can drive-by Moab Man and take a short hike to Ticaboo and Lulu's <br/>
Day out. The boxes on the Portal Trail are on this road too with a <br/>
bit of a steep hike.<br/>
<br/>
To acces the MOST boxes without long hikes I would recommend one of <br/>
the several campgrounds on highway 128 that heads east from just <br/>
north of Moab. There are LOTS of campsites on this road, and any will <br/>
do, I've stayed at Big Bend and I liked it. You can Drive By Desert <br/>
Bighorn, Paddle Hard, Colorado River, and The Westerns. Take a short <br/>
hike to Searching...., a medium hike to Alien Gothic, and a little <br/>
longer hike to Negro Bill. Rumor has it that another new box is going <br/>
in on the trail up Negro Bill Canyon just that week.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you folks are driving around campgrounds and see an old red <br/>
Isuzu Trooper with a bumper Sticker that says "Get A Clue- Go <br/>
Letterboxing", that will be us and we would be happy to make room for <br/>
you around our fire pit.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps,<br/>
<br/>

LOL . . . I'm still in Phoenix, AZ, and I planned to go to Utah<br/>
sometime anyway, so will try to work it around this party. I'm hoping<br/>
to be able to go early too, in order to hunt for boxes along the way.<br/>
It really would be great to meet everyone! It really is funny the<br/>
lengths this hobby pull you into!  ;)  WooHooooo!<br/>

I think Y covered the camping area pretty well! The camp sites along <br/>
the river are wonderful, but can be noisy with the road right next <br/>
to it. His site along 313 is a great site (there are some fun <br/>
petroglyphs at the canyon mouth of 7 mile canyon), quiet and less <br/>
traveled. It is along the road leading to Dead Horse Point &amp; <br/>
Canyonlands NP. There are a few spectacular sites at Dead Horse <br/>
Point and in Arches NP, but harder to get. The Arches sites have a <br/>
few walk-in signups everyday, but you must be at the visitor center <br/>
at 7:30 am to get one! Fisher Towers has a few sites (gorgeous) and <br/>
is located very near the fabulous Alien Gothic &amp; The Westerns Boxes, <br/>
but is a longer drive (30-40 minutes) to town. Kane Creek Canyon <br/>
(turn right at McDonald's and follow the rock rim till you're out <br/>
along the river) has some nice spots with less traffic noise, but is <br/>
a party area (I always see a lot of trash and bottles left around ) <br/>
and really south of town there isn't a lot. Behind the Rocks has <br/>
some sites, but I don't think they're real nice, plus you get a lot <br/>
of off roaders tearing around. Sand Flats Rec. area has some <br/>
beautiful spots. It is up the hill from Rotary Park just past the <br/>
Slickrock Bike Trail. It has been quite a party spot in the past, <br/>
but volunteers and BLM have really worked hard building sites and <br/>
blocking off old roads and old illegal sites. This is the only time <br/>
of the year that this area is really beautiful for camping (really <br/>
HOT in the summer). I'll let you know if I think of anywhere else! <br/>

Hey all!<br/>
<br/>
Okay - tentatively count in 5 more. Me, Samurai, Little Wolf and our <br/>
friends, Brother Raven and Moon Girl are trying to throw something <br/>
together!<br/>
<br/>
We all have dogs tho, that we don't think we can leave at home. I <br/>
don't suppose anyone in that area knows of a place where we can <br/>
leave the dogs while we are at the gathering? Cabins perhaps? We <br/>
thought about tent camping, but you can't really leave them in the <br/>
tent while gone. And these aren't exactly dogs you can put in your <br/>
purse either!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who put this thing together! What a lovely spot <br/>
for an early spring gathering!<br/>
<br/>
Hoping to see you all in Moab! Jodie - give me a write, maybe we can <br/>
all go together!<br/>

How awesome if you guys come over! April is usually not very hot, <br/>

by from my jeep while we are at the gathering. They tend to get in <br/>
trouble at home, so I bring them with me most places except work!<br/>
There is a trail network connected to the park that is leash-<br/>
friendly with dogs. You could walk them through the park to get to <br/>
the trail on the other side just to get them out for a bit. They <br/>
might just have to go with you to find a box down the trail!!!<br/>
<br/>
Kat<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Okay - tentatively count in 5 more. Me, Samurai, Little Wolf and <br/>
our <br/>
&gt; friends, Brother Raven and Moon Girl are trying to throw something <br/>
&gt; together!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We all have dogs tho, that we don't think we can leave at home. I <br/>
&gt; don't suppose anyone in that area knows of a place where we can <br/>
&gt; leave the dogs while we are at the gathering? Cabins perhaps? We <br/>
&gt; thought about tent camping, but you can't really leave them in the <br/>
&gt; tent while gone. And these aren't exactly dogs you can put in your <br/>
&gt; purse either!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks to everyone who put this thing together! What a lovely spot <br/>
&gt; for an early spring gathering!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hoping to see you all in Moab! Jodie - give me a write, maybe we <br/>
can <br/>
&gt; all go together!<br/>

it is really great!)  It would be great if more people signed up there<br/>
too for the gathering.  I like being able to see the list of who is<br/>
coming and not.  I think we have to be in the thirties by now.  Plus<br/>
if you sign up by clicking on the event in AQ, once it has passed it<br/>
will add the event to your PFXE count on your profile.  Always fun to<br/>
have a record of where you have been.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.  There are only about 11 signups listed right now, but<br/>
I know there are lots of others coming. We have at least three making<br/>
the trek from Idaho.  Mt Walker, are you going to make it from MT?  I<br/>
would love to finally meet you and exchange stamps.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I have the perfect (!!!!) spot for a cool letterbox, now I<br/>
just need to find time to carve a cool stamp for it.  It is in one of<br/>
my favorite S. Utah hikes, a ways north of Moab.  Maybe I will find<br/>
time to make a hitchhiker to exchange or leave too at the gather.  Oh<br/>
to have more time!<br/>

Wow, that's strange. I leave my computer for a couple of hours and,<br/>
when I get back the Yahoo Groups format is completely different!<br/>

But, I digress.<br/>

I hope you can plant it on the way down, too. It sounds like it will<br/>
be right on my way home, and wouldn't that be a treat!?<br/>

the websites for the private campgrounds don't look like my kind of<br/>

I'm a bit nervous b/c I can't come until Saturday night and I'm<br/>

seeing if others might be interested in reserving a group spot and<br/>
sharing it with each other, or if someone might want to go in earlier<br/>
and get a spot saved that I could come into later.  It might be fun<br/>
for some of us to camp together in a great campground and we could<br/>
exchange stamps earlier and save some time in the frenzy of exchanges<br/>
at the gathering.  I wouldn't mind sharing a camp spot at all if it is<br/>

and get a spot saved that I could come into later.  It might be fun<br/>
for some of us to camp together in a great campground and we could<br/>
exchange stamps earlier and save some time in the frenzy of exchanges<br/>
at the gathering.  I wouldn't mind sharing a camp spot at all if it is<br/>
with you folks.<br/>
