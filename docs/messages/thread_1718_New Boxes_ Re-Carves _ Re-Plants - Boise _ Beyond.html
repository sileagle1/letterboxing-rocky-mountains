                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was time for some re-carves and re-plants.  Today I planted two new boxes, created some Limited Edition LTC's from those boxes, provided maintenance to one and re-planted an additional four.  Whew!  If you are boxing in Boise or visiting make sure to print fresh clues for all of the boxes that have been re-planted as quite a few of them have new clues.  And don't forget to visit the Pioneer Cemetery in Horseshoe Bend as two new boxes are waiting for you.  Happy 4th of July!  Blackvelvetrav  Boise,  Idaho<br/>

*Take Flight  REACTIVATED! Meridian, Idaho*<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=13847 <br/>
Re-Carved &amp; Replanted.  Decided to tempt fate and have re-planted the box in this great old tree.  It is in the same hole but in the portion of the hole that is down and to the right instead of up and to the left.  Please, please, please recover with bark or it is doomed to go MIA again.  <br/>
<br/>
*Isaac  MAINTENANCE DONE!  Meridian, Idaho*<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=14091<br/>
New logbook added to box.  Box is alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
*Mallard in the Moonlight  REAVTIVATED!  Boise, Idaho*<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=6248<br/>
Re-Carved and Replanted.  Decided once more to tempt fate and re-planted the box in the same spot under the same rocks.  Please re-cover well with the smaller river rocks under the larger black rock.  Watch out for kids near the water.  The water can be swift moving and footing on the bank is precarious.  <br/>
<br/>
*Nightmare Before Christmas:  Shock  REACTIVATED! Boise, Idaho*<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=58412<br/>
Re-Carved and Re-Planted.  New Clues for "Shock".  In the same general area but a new hiding location at the cemetery.  <br/>
<br/>
"Flip Flop Fun"  REACTIVATED!  Boise, Idaho*<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=6314<br/>
This box was re-carved and re-planted.  It has moved from Middleton to Boise.  The location is a little difficult to reach because of construction so read all clue notes before deciding where to start.  Eventually this will not be an issue as the construction is reaching an end.  <br/>
