Spring in ages and ages.  Had one attempt in way big snow for Hot <br/>
Spring a while back, but that's IT! Which well, seems way odd to me <br/>
based on other status emails I get even for my outta state boxes. <br/>
Also, No Name needs a new box from what folks are telling me.   <br/>
Several reports on crack in box.  See specific First Aid request on <br/>
clue sheets.  Given proximity to all 3 with I-70 something just <br/>
seems weird.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, doing a bit of spring cleaning file/boxing-wise before I <br/>
pack everything for the Big Move (grrrrrrr) @ the end of this month <br/>
and just wondering if anyone might just happen to be passing by ANY <br/>
of these 'boxes as we get closer and closer to summer might find it <br/>
their hearts to stop by, check 'em out and let me know?  While I'd <br/>
love to think I have a road trip to the west planned this summer, at <br/>
this point I can't see it<br/>
<br/>
ANY help much apPREciated. I, of course, am super duper happy to <br/>
check up on any Front Range boxes any! time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
