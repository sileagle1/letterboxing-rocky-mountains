Which one can't you do with the kids? :::tries to think of it:::<br>
<br>
I had to run out and get my journal to count. I am F30 HH1 (I didn't <br>
count the two I found that didn't have stamps) and P...umm...16 I <br>
think. I have one almost ready to go to the Monster Mash that I'll <br>
place in Colorado when it returns, and a hitchhiker that will get <br>
shoosted off soon. Also a mystery box that I can hopefully place in <br>
the next week or so. I'm looking forward to getting the monster mash <br>
one back and seeing the journal full of east coast stamps!  I bet I <br>
won't get a Scotland, though!!<br>
<br>
I've been covering the state because that's the only way for me to <br>
find any boxes! :D  And it's fun for me to take some along to place <br>
as we go.  I really enjoy making them. <br>
