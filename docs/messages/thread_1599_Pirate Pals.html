<br>
It whar a fine mornin'....the sky was as blue as an oxygen deprived <br>
pirate and the Pearl shone like a... uh.. pearl.. in the bright <br>
September sun.  I raised anchor and sailed for the shore, singing <br>
chantys and enjoying fine salty snacks all the way.<br>
<br>
I sailed to a secret location and did a jig at the sight before me.  <br>
The silver mist hung heavy in the sea air...thick as something really <br>
thick, it rolled along the sand and carressed the sides of the Pearl. <br>
Soon, a little white schooner from Utah dropped anchor beside me and <br>
the fun began!  First the hugging!  Boxerlover!  ::hug hug::  <br>
CWSunseeker!  ::hug hug::  <br>
<br>
Sailing home from Live and Breathe, the brilliant pair was making a <br>
stop to find Buccaneer Gold and invited me to join them.  Yar... I <br>
loves a good treasure hunt! Using great boxer skills, BL had solved <br>
the location for the mystery box.. the clues which can only be found <br>
in a letterboxer trading card.  In a cloud of maps, notes, google <br>
earth print outs and history books, she waved the solution <br>
triumphantly in the air and, singing A Pirates Life for Me in three <br>
part harmony we hit the sand and headed for the treasure!  Being the <br>
planter I had a pretty good idea of where the bounty lay, but was <br>
sworn to zippin my lips and along just for the ride.<br>
<br>
On the way to the secret hidee hole we got distracted by some tide <br>
pools.  We poked starfish, squished anenomes and tapped on thousands <br>
of mussels.  There is a vague possibility that we were caught by an <br>
evil sneaker wave, but you'll never know!  HAR HAR HAR!<br>
<br>
All poked and squished out, it was on to the treasure.  They nabbed <br>
the first finder prizes.. woo!  <br>
<br>
We zoomed off to find another local box and ran into some other <br>
boxers there.  Then off to Roseburg for dinner and lots and lots and <br>
lots of chatting.  <br>
<br>
It were a little thing I like to call a dang good day.<br>
<br>
Congrats to BL for solving the mystery!<br>
<br>
And thanks to BL and CWS for sharing the day with me!  So much fun to <br>
see old friends and share some of my favorite places with them.<br>
<br>
Now.. who's coming up next?!<br>
<br>
Es, who would be happy to show people how she makes stuff, but <br>
they'll have to come up here to see it!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Visiting with our southern CO resident pirate on foreign shores was <br>
truly the icing on the cake for a fantastic 'boxing road trip that <br>
encompassed 2239 miles, Live & Breathe, ocean beaches, lighthouses, <br>
cool green forests, open plains, Crater Lake, a forest fire and a 200-<br>
mile detour around that forest fire. We barely scratched the surface <br>
in nine very full days; it would easily take a month to do the route <br>
justice. It was fun seeing other RML buddies, too. Seems odd to <br>
travel so many miles to see our 'neighbors,' but we will take our <br>
treats wherever we can. Now I need some time to recuperate from my <br>
vacation! <br>
