<br/>
It whar a fine mornin'....the sky was as blue as an oxygen deprived <br/>
pirate and the Pearl shone like a... uh.. pearl.. in the bright <br/>
September sun.  I raised anchor and sailed for the shore, singing <br/>
chantys and enjoying fine salty snacks all the way.<br/>
<br/>
I sailed to a secret location and did a jig at the sight before me.  <br/>
The silver mist hung heavy in the sea air...thick as something really <br/>
thick, it rolled along the sand and carressed the sides of the Pearl. <br/>
Soon, a little white schooner from Utah dropped anchor beside me and <br/>
the fun began!  First the hugging!  Boxerlover!  ::hug hug::  <br/>
CWSunseeker!  ::hug hug::  <br/>
<br/>
Sailing home from Live and Breathe, the brilliant pair was making a <br/>
stop to find Buccaneer Gold and invited me to join them.  Yar... I <br/>
loves a good treasure hunt! Using great boxer skills, BL had solved <br/>
the location for the mystery box.. the clues which can only be found <br/>
in a letterboxer trading card.  In a cloud of maps, notes, google <br/>
earth print outs and history books, she waved the solution <br/>
triumphantly in the air and, singing A Pirates Life for Me in three <br/>
part harmony we hit the sand and headed for the treasure!  Being the <br/>
planter I had a pretty good idea of where the bounty lay, but was <br/>
sworn to zippin my lips and along just for the ride.<br/>
<br/>
On the way to the secret hidee hole we got distracted by some tide <br/>
pools.  We poked starfish, squished anenomes and tapped on thousands <br/>
of mussels.  There is a vague possibility that we were caught by an <br/>
evil sneaker wave, but you'll never know!  HAR HAR HAR!<br/>
<br/>
All poked and squished out, it was on to the treasure.  They nabbed <br/>
the first finder prizes.. woo!  <br/>
<br/>
We zoomed off to find another local box and ran into some other <br/>
boxers there.  Then off to Roseburg for dinner and lots and lots and <br/>
lots of chatting.  <br/>
<br/>
It were a little thing I like to call a dang good day.<br/>
<br/>
Congrats to BL for solving the mystery!<br/>
<br/>
And thanks to BL and CWS for sharing the day with me!  So much fun to <br/>
see old friends and share some of my favorite places with them.<br/>
<br/>
Now.. who's coming up next?!<br/>
<br/>
Es, who would be happy to show people how she makes stuff, but <br/>
they'll have to come up here to see it!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Visiting with our southern CO resident pirate on foreign shores was <br/>
truly the icing on the cake for a fantastic 'boxing road trip that <br/>
encompassed 2239 miles, Live &amp; Breathe, ocean beaches, lighthouses, <br/>
cool green forests, open plains, Crater Lake, a forest fire and a 200-<br/>
mile detour around that forest fire. We barely scratched the surface <br/>
in nine very full days; it would easily take a month to do the route <br/>
justice. It was fun seeing other RML buddies, too. Seems odd to <br/>
travel so many miles to see our 'neighbors,' but we will take our <br/>
treats wherever we can. Now I need some time to recuperate from my <br/>
vacation! <br/>
