I got an email from Howling Coyote to my personal email address with a link attached.  When I clicked on the link, it downloaded a Trojan to my computer which we are still trying to get rid of.  I know she certainly wouldn't knowingly send such a message and wonder if there is something malicious going on with her email.  Is it possible to hijack a person's email address?  Don't know.<br/>

Howling Coyote-- If this is a misunderstanding, please e-mail me so we know what the link was for.  I personally thought the link was to a new letterbox clue.  Luckily, when I clicked it, the page did not load, (might have something to do with the cyber security here at the college where I work).<br/>
<br/>
Boxer Lover--  I am SO sorry if RMLetterboxing has allowed a Trojan to damage your computer.  Thank you very much for the heads-up.  I'm sure you saved a lot of trouble for the rest of us here.<br/>

I'm sorry to report that it also looks like I picked up a trojan at work late last week from it and now have a whole new computer.<br/>

Really, really glad I didn't click that link while at home!<br/>

My work computer got hit too when I opened the link from someone else. Thankfully the virus software on it caught it so I didn't even realize what had happened. It did hijack my email address so some of you that got hit with it may have sent it on to other people as well.<br/>
