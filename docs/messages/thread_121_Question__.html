RavenWolf here. Thanks for the invite into the group, sorry I haven't <br/>
said hello earlier.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for you guys. (Silver Eagle in particular, if <br/>
you're watching =] )<br/>
<br/>
In Silver Eagle's 'Grand Lake' letterbox, there is a big disclaimer <br/>
stating that the letterbox isn't on National Park land, so please <br/>
don't confiscate it. Is this a problem? I wasn't aware that we <br/>
weren't supposed to put letterboxes out in National Parks. Besides <br/>
the attrocious fee to get into them, is there some other strange <br/>
taboo that we need to be aware of when placing new boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Not that it's going to happen now since it got cold. Brrrr. I haven't <br/>
seen the sun in 5 days!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the input.<br/>

My understanding is that the National Park Service is totally <br/>
against any objects (letterboxes, geocaches, etc.) being placed <br/>
in their parks.  If they find one, they will confiscate it and<br/>
probably throw it away.  They have even been known to look on<br/>
the letterboxing.org website to see if any boxes are on their<br/>
land, then use the clues to find and confiscate them.  It is a<br/>
shame since there are many great places to hide boxes on NPS<br/>
land, but it is not worth the hassel.<br/>
Some State Parks have strict rules, too (my box in Arkansas<br/>
was temporarily confiscated), so you may want to ask permission<br/>
first.<br/>

Send some of that cold weather my way.  It is still in the<br/>
mid-80s here (Texas).  Actually, I prefer warm over cold so <br/>
maybe I should send some of my weather up to you!<br/>

Park system are more than just the fact that they don't like it or frown on<br/>
things being left behind.  It is illegal to leave things behind in a<br/>
National Park.  There are a few people that have snuck a few in under the<br/>
table, but many of those have been confiscated and they certainly aren't<br/>
listed on the LBNA site since that could get the site it trouble.<br/>

I have always been sad about these policies.  Since I live right by<br/>
Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons, I always want to plant there, but I have<br/>
to resist the urge. :-)<br/>

It was there as of 8/7/03 when I visited, but if the park<br/>
does a search of www.letterboxing.org they may confiscate it.<br/>
That would be a shame because the microbox is not in a<br/>
harmful place.  I have to admit that I don't usually check<br/>
to see if a park has rules against boxes, but maybe I<br/>
should.  Most people here in Texas have never heard of<br/>
letterboxing so I assumed the parks would not know about it<br/>
either.<br/>

I actually wrote to the Colorado State Parks to see what their policy <br/>
was. This is what they wrote back:<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Thank you for your inquiry into Colorado state parks' policy  <br/>
&gt;concerning<br/>
&gt;geocaching and letterboxing. As far as I am aware, there are no<br/>
&gt;regulations with respect to these hobbies. However, I am certain <br/>
&gt;that these<br/>
&gt;activities would be allowed in our parks provided that the animals <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;environment would not experience a disturbance.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;If you have additional questions, or if I can be of any more <br/>
&gt;assistance,<br/>
&gt;please feel free to contact me. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Cherylynne Gerton<br/>
&gt;Administrative Assistant III<br/>
&gt;Colorado State Parks<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, it sounds like as long as you don't have people tromping waaayyy <br/>
off trails, and pestering the wildlife it should be okay. Or at <br/>
least, you can tell the people at the parks that Cerylynne Gerton <br/>
said it was. ;]<br/>
