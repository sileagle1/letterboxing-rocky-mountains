Hello--<br/>
    I just got back from a backpacking trip near Moab--it was <br/>
awesome! We got a little snow each night but it was gone before <br/>
breakfast was over. You can just feel the weather starting to settle <br/>
over there. There was green grass, a babbling brook, some waterfalls, <br/>
and some of the most colorful sandstone walls that I've ever seen. <br/>
(And I've seen a lot!) I just missed the weather window because it <br/>
was a bluebird day when we hiked back out today.<br/>
<br/>
     Esmerelda. It won't be the same without you. You can bet we'll <br/>
be doing some flag waving, saluting, and pie eating in your honor to <br/>
try to make up for it. And the famous missmoon coming out west? That <br/>
sounds like an excellent excuse for another gathering.<br/>
<br/>
     We get a traveling event stamp too? Suhweet! <br/>
<br/>
     I've got to say, I look forward to reading the posts here. And <br/>
after a few days away it was neat to come back and catch up. There <br/>
sure is a lot going on with Channel Seven Mitch, Jeffco's new rules, <br/>
Box on the Rocks, Carving Classes, PLB's. What struck me is how <br/>
everyone is fostering letterboxing with such care, helping it along <br/>
and treating it like the precious and precarious thing that it is. <br/>
Just something I noticed and am thankful for.<br/>
