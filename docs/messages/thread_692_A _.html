I generally don't sit around while stamping in and read every single word that someone may have written.  Maybe I'm a minority but I don't want to attract too much attention.<br>

I love history that is PART of the clues if possible.  Esmereldas clues for example have history in them (and also in the log books I think) and some that are fictionial stories.  The Zebediah Gump series are stories that SOUND like history that really make the clues fun (my daughter loved them-she wants to find all of them because they were fun.) So Id say put the history in the clues AND in the book.<br>
Just my 2cents.<br>

  I like to have them in the box, or half in the box and half in the <br>
  clues. That way there is something really cool to look forward to <br>
  besides the stamp. I have to go out and actually find the box if I <br>
  want the whole story. Keeps me from being lazy and just reading it <br>
  in the clues! =3<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I like info that I can read early if it is long and will take a while to <br>
read, but it can be cumbersome to a clue. I once had a mystery box that I <br>
found that had an insert about the history that I enjoyed in the box, but it <br>
didn't take forever to read. It made for an interesting box. I might <br>
laminate it to protect it from the elements. I guess my answer is . . . hmm <br>
. . . I don't know. I was going to vote for not in the box and in the clue, <br>
but I'm not as sure now. I don't want a novel in the box though.<br>
 The way this mystery box occurred was fun for me as far as history goes. <br>
The clue was incredibly vague (It was only one word in the name, then the <br>
clue itself was just a small diagram that showed you where to find the <br>
hiding spot once you got there. The diagram did not reveal anything about <br>
the clue) The fun thing about this clue was that in order to look up the <br>
box, you had to delve into history and figure out what the name meant. I <br>
read up on quite a bit of history before I figured out for sure where the <br>
box was. It made it really fun to find it and then getting there and seeing <br>
a little bonus history was nice.<br>
 Okay, I'm rambling now. I need to head off for a get-together with friends. <br>
I will talk to you all later.<br>
