 <br>
Just an introduction here. My name is Kris and I live in Colorado Springs. I am very new to letterboxing but so fascinated by it all. I first heard about it in january and went to search online and came across the lbna website. I have printed all the clues in the Co Springs area but of course did not get out right away. <br>
reading some of your past posts i recognize some of you from the LB clues. I think this is going to be a cool hobby for the kids and myself. My 8 yo son has already made his own stamp and a log book to use. <br>
I was mainly looking at it as a great way to get some exercise. So starting with the easier trails and then working our way to the longer and more difficult. <br>
I emailed Esmerelda about the Missing box at the Ren faire and she told me about this group of fun and friendly letter boxers and asked me to join. <br>
 <br>
Thank you, Esmerelda! <br>
 <br>
Now I am very curious where you all live....<br>
 <br>
Kris<br>

Welcome to our group! I see you have already learned the secret <br>
password, PIE! LOL!<br>
<br>
I'm Kat, and I normally live in Moab, Utah, which means I'll travel <br>
far and wide for boxes! Right now I'm stuck in California for a few <br>
weeks while my son is working on summer school (grrr).<br>
<br>
Of course, now that I am out here, there are all sorts of new boxes <br>
out there, (grrrrr). And..... I see Miss Moon and our own Es have <br>
been very busy lately!<br>
<br>
Actually there are a few new boxers out here in Carmel, so I have <br>
been busy finding some fun boxes in Carmel and Big Sur!<br>
<br>
Kat(enjoying living in civilization where pie is easily attainable)<br>
