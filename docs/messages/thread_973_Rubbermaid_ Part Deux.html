                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, I talked to a man today at a company called Transworld Imports, <br/>
based in Vancouver.  I found their catalog after searching through <br/>
about a zillion web pages.  They have those little 3.5" square <br/>
Rubbermaid boxes.  He told me they have been discontinued in the US <br/>
but not in Canada and he can get them.  Only problem is, the frieght <br/>
from Canada could be prohibitive, and would be better if spread over a <br/>
large order.  I don't know yet what shipping would be, but since I <br/>
don't need 100 boxes or so, I was wondering if other folks on the list <br/>
would be interested in going in on an order.  Let me know off-list at <br/>
