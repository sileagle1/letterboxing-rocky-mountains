What an exciting morning we had spotting ancient doorways and <br/>
columns in the distance. The Arboc is a personal favorite. It was a <br/>
hilarious morning of slip sliding through patches of snow, ice, and <br/>
mud to find the MOST awesome box, Alien Gothic. This is my new most-<br/>
favoritest box and stamp, and tooooo much fun. And to top it off, we <br/>
couldn't stop laughing as an airplane flew over, echoing through the <br/>
towers, as we were stamping in. I know "they" were watching us.<br/>

I don't know Es, I'm kinda likin' the disco-cisco-a-mo-mo trail, <br/>
maybe with an arrrr at the end. It does rollllll off the tongue. And <br/>
maybe we could add a special pie letterbox around Cisco, just to get <br/>
you in the mood. We could specify that everyone must do the foot to <br/>
foot frenzy while chanting the name anytime they find a box!  <br/>
Kennamtn went with me to find the aliens, by the way, she is always <br/>
good for a hike and a laugh. So we try to hike or snowshoe several <br/>
days a week! Anyone coming this way is always welcome to join our <br/>
fun!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Kat (wondering if there is a kind of pie that would fit in with our <br/>
dance/chant thing)<br/>
