For those not on the big message board:<br>
Anyone interested in adopting an abandoned letterbox should visit the LBNA<br>
main website at www.letterboxing.org - click where it says "search for<br>
boxes" and then search by "placer" where the placer is abandoned box.<br>
If you can adopt a box, it just means you'd need check to see its status,<br>
does it need a new ink pad or logbook?  Then email Wes (the webmaster of the<br>
main website) and let him know you'd like to adopt the box.  We can get you<br>
Wes' email address if you need it and can't locate it on the board.<br>
<br>
Let's keep those boxes in CO active!  :)<br>

   Since I am in the southwest corner of the state I could adopt some <br>
of the boxes down here. There is an abandoned one near Ouray and <br>
supposedly another one near Andrews Lake on Molas Pass. But I am not <br>
sure if I could check them more than a couple of times a year. Is <br>
that often enough? Any opinions would be appreciated.<br>
