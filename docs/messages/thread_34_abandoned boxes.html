Anyone interested in adopting an abandoned letterbox should visit the LBNA<br/>

boxes" and then search by "placer" where the placer is abandoned box.<br/>
If you can adopt a box, it just means you'd need check to see its status,<br/>
does it need a new ink pad or logbook?  Then email Wes (the webmaster of the<br/>
main website) and let him know you'd like to adopt the box.  We can get you<br/>
Wes' email address if you need it and can't locate it on the board.<br/>

Let's keep those boxes in CO active!  :)<br/>

   Since I am in the southwest corner of the state I could adopt some <br/>
of the boxes down here. There is an abandoned one near Ouray and <br/>
supposedly another one near Andrews Lake on Molas Pass. But I am not <br/>
sure if I could check them more than a couple of times a year. Is <br/>
that often enough? Any opinions would be appreciated.<br/>
