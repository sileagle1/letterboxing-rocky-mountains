an upcoming trip to CO, but I thought I'd go ahead and post here and <br/>
see if anyone would be interested/able to do a meet and greet.<br/>
<br/>
A friend (OneMeanGreenBean) and I (Lnd-Crzr on LBNA and LndCrzr on AQ) <br/>
will be arriving in Denver on the 16th of this month and will be in <br/>
town for a few days.  It's a road-trip, seat-of-your-pants kind of <br/>
thing so nothing is set in stone yet, excecpt our arrival date.  After <br/>
leaving Denver we'll be spending a week in the Pagosa Springs/Durango <br/>
area.  <br/>
<br/>
I certain hope to meet at least a few of you fine folks.  A simple <br/>
picnic affair would be just fine with us.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nice to hear your trip is getting closer. Looking<br/>
&gt; forward to meeting <br/>
&gt; you!  Hoping a few other Front Range boxers would<br/>
&gt; like to get <br/>
&gt; together for a meet and greet.  So may I be so<br/>
&gt; PREsumptious as to <br/>
&gt; step up and be your hostess in the Denver area? :-)<br/>
&gt; at least your <br/>
&gt; first time through town, as I'll be off to the PNW<br/>
&gt; for my own summer <br/>
&gt; vacation on your return trip.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the past I've suggested places in Denver proper,<br/>
&gt; and am happy to <br/>
&gt; do so if that's what folks are up for, but as it<br/>
&gt; happens I have to go <br/>
&gt; to Golden each day after work next week because I am<br/>
&gt; house/pet <br/>
&gt; sitting for a friend/fellow 'boxer.  Those doggies<br/>
&gt; need dinner before <br/>
&gt; I would be able to meet up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, logistically then, I think that perhaps meeting<br/>
&gt; somewhere in <br/>
&gt; Golden would be best.  Maybe the park where Silver<br/>
&gt; Eagle's Coors Beer <br/>
&gt; letterbox is? Depending on who's coming we could<br/>
&gt; either then wander <br/>
&gt; over to the main street in town and do<br/>
&gt; food/beverages, or perhaps do <br/>
&gt; some boxing in the area?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just to toss something out there, how does this work<br/>
&gt; for folks?<br/>
&gt; 7pm Tuesday, 7/17<br/>
&gt; at the park "Coors LB Park"<br/>
&gt; Golden<br/>

up.  We get into town on the 16th and our host (who's is as of yet a <br/>
non-boxer) plans on taking us into the mountains to camp the night of <br/>
the 17th, so could we plan on meeting on the 18th?  Sorry to be such <br/>
a pain.   I hope we can hit a few boxes on the monring of the 17th <br/>
and the morning of the 18th and then I think we might spend one full <br/>
day hunting on the 19th.  <br/>
<br/>
The time and location seem fine.  My traveling campanion and I are <br/>
both excited about this trip and meeting up with some of the CO <br/>
crew!  In fact it seems that LB may be consuming more of our trip <br/>
than we origionaly planned.  But seeing as how this is one of those <br/>
seat-of-our-pants roadtrips, we're game for whatever comes our way!  <br/>
It's GRAND having summers off!<br/>
