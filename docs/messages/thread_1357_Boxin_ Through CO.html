                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all!  I've been in touch with several of you already regrading <br>
an upcoming trip to CO, but I thought I'd go ahead and post here and <br>
see if anyone would be interested/able to do a meet and greet.<br>
<br>
A friend (OneMeanGreenBean) and I (Lnd-Crzr on LBNA and LndCrzr on AQ) <br>
will be arriving in Denver on the 16th of this month and will be in <br>
town for a few days.  It's a road-trip, seat-of-your-pants kind of <br>
thing so nothing is set in stone yet, excecpt our arrival date.  After <br>
leaving Denver we'll be spending a week in the Pagosa Springs/Durango <br>
area.  <br>
<br>
I certain hope to meet at least a few of you fine folks.  A simple <br>
picnic affair would be just fine with us.  <br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
Lnd-Crzr<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Would love to have you as our hostess!  Plans are beginning to firm <br>
up.  We get into town on the 16th and our host (who's is as of yet a <br>
non-boxer) plans on taking us into the mountains to camp the night of <br>
the 17th, so could we plan on meeting on the 18th?  Sorry to be such <br>
a pain.   I hope we can hit a few boxes on the monring of the 17th <br>
and the morning of the 18th and then I think we might spend one full <br>
day hunting on the 19th.  <br>
<br>
The time and location seem fine.  My traveling campanion and I are <br>
both excited about this trip and meeting up with some of the CO <br>
crew!  In fact it seems that LB may be consuming more of our trip <br>
than we origionaly planned.  But seeing as how this is one of those <br>
seat-of-our-pants roadtrips, we're game for whatever comes our way!  <br>
It's GRAND having summers off!<br>
