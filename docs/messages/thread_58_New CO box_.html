Anyway - here's the clues:<br/>
<br/>
Engineer Mountain Box<br/>
Placed by: Ed  <br/>
Placement date: Aug 17 2003<br/>
State: Colorado<br/>
County: La Plata <br/>
Nearest city: Durango<br/>
Number of boxes: 1<br/>
<br/>
Clues<br/>
This box is located on the trail to Engineer Mountain. The trailhead <br/>
is on Highway 550 north of Durango at the top of Coal Bank Pass. Turn <br/>
west opposite the large parking area with restrooms.<br/>
There is a beautiful lake a little less than a mile up the trail. <br/>
After the lake the the trail straightens out as it contours up along <br/>
the side of a hill. After about a quarter mile the trail turns <br/>
sharply back to the right.<br/>

<br/>
BTW, I will be there Saturday...my first event...actually<br/>
just heard about LB a week ago....did my stamp yesterday<br/>
and am ready to start.  Actually went to Chatfield on Thursday<br/>
for a "trial run" with my kids...needed to give them a visual rather <br/>
than explaining letterboxing...they are psyched (spelling?).<br/>
We found the 2/but since I didnt have a stamp I must go back and<br/>
do it right.<br/>
<br/>
See you all Saturday.<br/>

I bet the problem is that the county La Plata is set up in<br/>
the wrong Region database table that the webmasters set up.<br/>
We had the same thing happen in Texas and I had to send a note<br/>
to Wes Garrison to get it fixed.  Just tell him the county<br/>
name and what Region it should be in to fix this box and<br/>
future ones, too.<br/>
