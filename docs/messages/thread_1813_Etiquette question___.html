be somewhat controversial, but that I would like to hear you guys sound off<br>
about.<br>
<br>
I had a box out there that skirted around a somewhat religious idea - lemme<br>
'splain...  It's The Goddess, and I had mentioned in the narrative that some<br>
people pictured her as Mary.  The box is hidden in a beautiful, tiny, family<br>
cemetery behind a grotto to Mary.  Beautiful.  The log book was full, so I<br>
scooped it up to replace it and get it replanted and I was VERY dismayed to<br>
find several nasty comments about how wrong I was and how offended people<br>
were.  I was really hurt!  (there were some wonderful comments as well, and<br>
to those people, I again say thank you) That's a huge reason why this box<br>
has been sitting down in my basement gathering dust.  Some of you have found<br>
this box and I hope agree that it is a beautiful and very tasteful stamp and<br>
I miss having it out there!  So, I guess I ask you...  Should I put it back<br>
out there? and I have a start of a little something that I would either like<br>
to put in the clues or in the logbook...  Will it just add fuel to the<br>
fire?  What do you guys think?  I am planning on renaming the box, just made<br>
a fabulous new log for it (thanks RavenWolf - LOVE you!) and am changing up<br>
the narrative of the clues - they were quite wordy as you see that I tend to<br>
get sometimes.<br>
<br>
So...<br>
<br>
PLEASE approach the beliefs expressed here with an OPEN MIND, just as I<br>
would approach you or your beliefs. I present this image and these ideas NOT<br>
as a religious icon, but as an archetype. If you disagree with my<br>
presentation, I ask you that you not use my log book to express that. If<br>
that is the case, and we ALL have the right to express our beliefs, please<br>
don't do it here by making negative comments; rather contact me via email.<br>

Oh, Aljan, I'm so sorry you've had negative comments on your box. I've not found it myself, but of course, know your work and I'm sure the stamp, log book and location are up to your usual standards.<br>
<br>
I approach letterboxing as the recipient of someone else's gift and would never leave negative comments in a log book, even if I felt that way - it's just rude! Perhaps adding the verbiage you are thinking of to the clue would discourage those who might be offended from looking for it. I do think that maybe eliminating the capitals might be less inflammatory. You are offended - and rightly so - by the negative comments, but I think your reaction is clouded by your personal stake in the box. It sounds like most people praised your work. <br>
<br>
I vote that you re-plant the box and let folks decide for themselves after reading your preamble in the clues whether or not to look for it. I know I certainly would give it a shot!<br>

I've had some rude comments on Atlas Quest on one of my box series.  I did not let it slide - rather I emailed the person back, and told them how hurtful I thought their comments were.  (I dont think it mattered one whip to this person. I think she's socially clueless).  <br>

Aljan Sundance is such an appropriate "label" for a most beautiful "soul"!  Put that remarkable box back...it's one of my favorites!  It's artwork that shouldn't be kept hidden because of a few "mean" people.  Tear those thoughtless pages out of your journal and don't spare them one more minute of thought!  Unfortunately, there are mean people in all walks of life and it's best to just walk right past them...save your energies for those that care and love life!<br>

<br>
Miss Aljan, we letterboxers come from many, many walks of life. There are many boxes out there expressing what gives us passion, joy and inspiration. Whether that be our children, hobbies, work, or spiritual beliefs. We take joy in it, and want to share it with others through our art. <br>
<br>
We all have the power of choice. Your clues were pretty clear as to what that particular box represented to you. Just like we are able to change the radio station, or the television channel if there is something we don't want to see, or hear, or experience, we can CHOOSE to pass it by. <br>
<br>
The mere fact that someone knew exactly what they were searching for, went and got it anyway, and then complained about it says tons about THEM. And as a good friend of mine once said - I have no time for those types of people. <br>
<br>
Sometimes we all need to gently be told to be nice. And if anyone listening is one of those people that felt the need to express themselves publicly in Aljan's logbook, or, Aljan if you would like to pass on some of the comments of the community, you are welcome to use mine:<br>
<br>
We are all letterboxers, brought together by our art and joy and passion. Be nice. Because, really, there is no excuse not to be. Courtesy greases the wheels of society. I'm not saying we can't express our opinion, but surely we can do that in a respectful and gentle manner. *AND* I don't know of any religion that does not preach tolerance and respect of our fellow human beings. Due to the numerous types of people and varying backgrounds in this hobby, tolerance is a must. If you can't do that, this is not a hobby for you.<br>
<br>
Put it back out there. Share with us your joy and passion. Some of us are grateful for your beautiful gifts. =3<br>
<br>
Blessed Be, pretty lady.<br>

I like the paragraph at the bottom...but I'm sure some will still make nasty comments.  You've warned them that they might find it somewhat controversial and if they are concerned about that, then please skip the box. <br>
 <br>
Pre had something similar in one of her boxes...she stated that it may be offensive to some and would they please just pass that box on by.  If not, keep their comments to themselves.<br>
 <br>
I'm planning on putting a box out there that some would say is 'tasteless'...to commemorate a rather morbid event in history.  The stamp will be somewhat commical, but I plan on putting a warning out there that people with kids or those who won't appreciate the stamp should probably skip the box.  If they chose to ignore the warning, tough.<br>
 <br>
Replant...and ignore the rest.<br>

Oh, Aljan, I'm so sorry you've had negative comments on your box. I've not found it myself, but of course, know your work and I'm sure the stamp, log book and location are up to your usual standards.<br>
<br>
I approach letterboxing as the recipient of someone else's gift and would never leave negative comments in a log book, even if I felt that way - it's just rude! Perhaps adding the verbiage you are thinking of to the clue would discourage those who might be offended from looking for it. I do think that maybe eliminating the capitals might be less inflammatory. You are offended - and rightly so - by the negative comments, but I think your reaction is clouded by your personal stake in the box. It sounds like most people praised your work. <br>
<br>
I vote that you re-plant the box and let folks decide for themselves after reading your preamble in the clues whether or not to look for it. I know I certainly would give it a shot!<br>

Well said RavenWolf... life is way too short to worry about people who feel it is necessary to ruin someone else's day... not worth it.<br>

Ahhhh! There is no <agree> button on yahoo! (Autumn, 3DTs, BoxerLvr, Dixie, etc, etc, etc)<br>

Miss Aljan, we letterboxers come from many, many walks of life. There are many boxes out there expressing what gives us passion, joy and inspiration. Whether that be our children, hobbies, work, or spiritual beliefs. We take joy in it, and want to share it with others through our art. <br>
<br>
We all have the power of choice. Your clues were pretty clear as to what that particular box represented to you. Just like we are able to change the radio station, or the television channel if there is something we don't want to see, or hear, or experience, we can CHOOSE to pass it by. <br>
<br>
The mere fact that someone knew exactly what they were searching for, went and got it anyway, and then complained about it says tons about THEM. And as a good friend of mine once said - I have no time for those types of people. <br>
<br>
Sometimes we all need to gently be told to be nice. And if anyone listening is one of those people that felt the need to express themselves publicly in Aljan's logbook, or, Aljan if you would like to pass on some of the comments of the community, you are welcome to use mine:<br>
<br>
We are all letterboxers, brought together by our art and joy and passion. Be nice. Because, really, there is no excuse not to be. Courtesy greases the wheels of society. I'm not saying we can't express our opinion, but surely we can do that in a respectful and gentle manner. *AND* I don't know of any religion that does not preach tolerance and respect of our fellow human beings. Due to the numerous types of people and varying backgrounds in this hobby, tolerance is a must. If you can't do that, this is not a hobby for you.<br>
<br>
Put it back out there. Share with us your joy and passion. Some of us are grateful for your beautiful gifts. =3<br>
<br>
Blessed Be, pretty lady.<br>
