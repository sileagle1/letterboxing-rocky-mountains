                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wanted to update that Best Seat in Town has been taken. We were up <br>
there last weekend and the box was gone and all that was left was a <br>
nasty note about how ever since that box had been placed this person <br>
has noticed a decrease in the number critters in the area and how <br>
letterboxers are destroying the environment blah blah blah. I sent a <br>
note to the planter but the site hasn't been updated to reflect that <br>
Best Seat is no longer there. <br>
THANKS<br>
