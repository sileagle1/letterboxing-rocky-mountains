                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br>
I found a bunch of boxes this weekend and during the week. Oh and <br>
Saturday got me over the F100 mark...woohoo!  I know, I know I still <br>
havent placed any-but I have 6 log books ready to go and 6 stamps I <br>
have drawn/just havent carved them yet. <br>
Found King of all he Surveys and Waterbearer.  (Ive still only found<br>
about 1/2 of that series so far).  Went to Buffalo Bill-WOW-Im still in <br>
Awe of that stamp!!!  Also Ive lived here 20 years and never bill to BB <br>
Grave before.  What a view!  Also went to Jennys to find Yes.  You all <br>
need to go to this one.  What a great story and my type of <br>
cafe/restaurant.  They had the best cream of mushroom soup Ive ever <br>
had.  I had the burger (per Aljans suggestion) and my friend had the <br>
vege enchiladas...both excellent.  There are only a few pages left in <br>
the log book (maybe 4 or 5).  The waiter wasnt too familiar with lbing <br>
and asked us about it (he said the other times people had come in they <br>
were too busy in the rest for him to ask about the sport (addiction).)<br>
So maybe we will have a new lber in the area!  He seemed pretty <br>
interested.  <br>
On Sunday I went to Coors Beer-my first Silver Eagle box. Very cute.<br>
also on Sunday went to Enginerd.  Nice hiding place-watch out for those <br>
cyclists!<br>
<br>
On Wednesday I also found Smiley in Highlands Ranch and the 3 Daniels <br>
Park boxes--nice walk and great views!<br>
<br>
Im looking forward to seeing everyone on Saturday and finding some <br>
boxes on the way over the mtns.<br>
<br>
Now Im off to buy the ingredients for PIE.<br>

Only a few pages left in my log!  Yikes!  My but 'yes' has turned into a popular box.  Thanks for the update.  I am glad that you enjoyed it and Jenny's.<br>
