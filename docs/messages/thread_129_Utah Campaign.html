                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Folks-<br>
    This past weekend my kids and I took a letterboxing tour through <br>
southwest Utah. Not many boxes, but a good excuse to get out and <br>
travel through some wonderful country. I was amazed at how excited we <br>
were when we approached the letterboxes. It seems like such a silly <br>
pastime that we are involved in, and it is hard to explain to my <br>
friends how much fun it is. Blowing a whole Sunday to drive around <br>
looking for treasures that strangers have planted. Seeing the stamps <br>
of other boxers that have now become familiar. And the stamps! I am <br>
always so amazed at the clever creations of the hiders and the <br>
seekers. What a great day.<br>
    Just some appreciative musings...<br>

P.S. Autumn, I have added some logistical info to the end of the <br>
Engineer Mountain Box Clues. In case you want to copy them to your <br>
archives.<br>
     Peace.<br>

Just curious, did you happen to find Baby Bear's or my boxes<br>
in that area?<br>

    No, we just had the one day. I think we will need more time for <br>
yours. But those boxes are very high on my wish list. And still <br>
accessible in winter.<br>
    There won't be any box hunting done in the mountains for a while.<br>
