<br>
I will check on Snappy some time this week for sure! We have had some <br>
amazing flashfloods this year, bigger than anyone alive in this area <br>
recalls ever seeing, so it is definitely possible. He was placed <br>
close to that wash, which may have flashed and taken him for a ride <br>
down to Lake Powell!!!! The river never went very high this season, <br>
so I'm sure that wasn't the problem, but the sand may have changed <br>
and put him in a puddle. If I find him, I'll bring him home for some <br>
TLC if necessary. Poor Aspen has had her first box washed out twice <br>
this year! We replaced it once, and then after another storm we found <br>
it 50 feet down the rocks and into a wash, lid ripped off, but the <br>
bags kept everything safe!<br>
<br>
On a happier note, there are four new boxes planted in Moab and <br>
THAT'S SOOOOOO EXCITING!!!! Kenna and I are getting out the boxing <br>
stuff after a boxing drought, yay!<br>

I was in Moab this weekend and did indeed FIND SNAPPY! That scraggly <br>
pup led me on a merry chase. The problem seems to be that the <br>
second "No camping" sign (the one across the wash) is gone - maybe <br>
washed out by some of that recent flash flooding?<br>
<br>
Peach, I will email you privately with particulars. But never fear, <br>
the Dread Snappy is alive and safe (and dry!) in his lair behind the <br>
gray big rock!<br>
