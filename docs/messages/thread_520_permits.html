Hi Chaucey!<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure the Kiwi is okay.. it's literally next to a trail <br>
and not in the wetlands or anything.  She told me to just leave it <br>
until they check it and they'll let me know if it has to be moved. <br>
I've got my fingers crossed!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">thank you so much for this information.  I have been so confused.  I would <br>
like to ask everyone what to do about the one still in Roxborough put out a <br>
few years ago up on South Rim.  I found it (even tho it is not listed on the <br>
clue list) and the stamp is gone, but the journal was in there about a month <br>
ago.  Should I remove it for someone to mail back to him?  (I forgot his <br>
name)  It does have a social trail and so does the one up on Lyon's Overlook <br>
because it has been there about four years.   Any ideas from anyone?  I go <br>
to Roxborough every couple of weeks, so I can always do whatever is needed <br>
there.  Puppypaws of Littleton (Kathy)<br>

Kathy,<br>
Heres the link for that Roxborough Box.  You can email him then send <br>
him the log book.  <br>
<br>
  http://members.cox.net/ae4mk/letterbox/<br>
<br>
He wants all his boxes pulled or adopted/but he wants the log books <br>
back.  Since there is not stamp anymore then might as well send it <br>
back.<br>
