Hi Chaucey!<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure the Kiwi is okay.. it's literally next to a trail <br/>
and not in the wetlands or anything.  She told me to just leave it <br/>
until they check it and they'll let me know if it has to be moved. <br/>
I've got my fingers crossed!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">thank you so much for this information.  I have been so confused.  I would <br/>
like to ask everyone what to do about the one still in Roxborough put out a <br/>
few years ago up on South Rim.  I found it (even tho it is not listed on the <br/>
clue list) and the stamp is gone, but the journal was in there about a month <br/>
ago.  Should I remove it for someone to mail back to him?  (I forgot his <br/>
name)  It does have a social trail and so does the one up on Lyon's Overlook <br/>
because it has been there about four years.   Any ideas from anyone?  I go <br/>
to Roxborough every couple of weeks, so I can always do whatever is needed <br/>
there.  Puppypaws of Littleton (Kathy)<br/>

Heres the link for that Roxborough Box.  You can email him then send <br/>
him the log book.  <br/>
<br/>
  http://members.cox.net/ae4mk/letterbox/<br/>
<br/>
He wants all his boxes pulled or adopted/but he wants the log books <br/>
back.  Since there is not stamp anymore then might as well send it <br/>
back.<br/>
