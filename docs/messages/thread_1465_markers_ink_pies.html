How do you "condition" a stamp with a sharpie. I have a stamp that I <br>
carved out of PZCut Grade B and you can see a line where the ink <br>
doesn't get picked up as well......do you think this might help??<br>

Garden variety apple will do just fine...I think it really is the <br>
king of pies. And just thinking of a "mean cherry-peach" gives me <br>
goosebumps.<br>
<br>
I think I need to go get me some breakfast.....<br>

It may!  PZ is my favorite carving medium, but the<br>
PZKut stamps don't always pick up ink well right out<br>
of the box (pun intended).  I condition them by<br>
basically going over the stamp with a Sharpie and<br>
letting it dry.  It basically acts as a primer to help<br>
the stamp pick up ink.<br>
<br>
I believe some people also go over the stamp with<br>
acetone, but I've had good luck with the Sharpie<br>
method.<br>

If you notice it BEFORE carving, you can be more agresstive. I've <br>
also had good luck with acetone, used sparingly.<br>
