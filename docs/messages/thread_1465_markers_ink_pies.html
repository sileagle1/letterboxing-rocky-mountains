How do you "condition" a stamp with a sharpie. I have a stamp that I <br/>
carved out of PZCut Grade B and you can see a line where the ink <br/>
doesn't get picked up as well......do you think this might help??<br/>

Garden variety apple will do just fine...I think it really is the <br/>
king of pies. And just thinking of a "mean cherry-peach" gives me <br/>
goosebumps.<br/>
<br/>
I think I need to go get me some breakfast.....<br/>

It may!  PZ is my favorite carving medium, but the<br/>
PZKut stamps don't always pick up ink well right out<br/>
of the box (pun intended).  I condition them by<br/>
basically going over the stamp with a Sharpie and<br/>
letting it dry.  It basically acts as a primer to help<br/>
the stamp pick up ink.<br/>
<br/>
I believe some people also go over the stamp with<br/>
acetone, but I've had good luck with the Sharpie<br/>
method.<br/>

If you notice it BEFORE carving, you can be more agresstive. I've <br/>
also had good luck with acetone, used sparingly.<br/>
