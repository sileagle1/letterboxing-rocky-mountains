<br>
I'm glad we didn't have to fight any rainstorms this weekend up in <br>
Salt Lake City, just on the drive up! Found the Snowbird Letterbox up <br>
Little Cottonwood Canyon, and Sharp Tooth in Price. Both were fun and <br>
the one at Snowbird was in some incredible terrain.<br>
<br>
We found the Kokopelli HH by Little Wolf at "When a Frog is a Horse" <br>
(which is a VERY clever stamp!). Kokopelli started in Colorado, worked <br>
it's way to the east coast via Texas and all the way back to Moab, WOW!<br>
<br>
I hope everyone is having a good boxing time!<br>
