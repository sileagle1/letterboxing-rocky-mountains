our schedules for September.  I have to choose three schedules and <br/>
wait to see what the two ladies senior to me take.  I know I'll get <br/>
one of the three,  but have no idea which.  The only weekend date <br/>
that is on all three schedules is the 17th, so it's the only one <br/>
that's safe for me to commit to at this point!  Two of them have the <br/>
18th, so I'd be happy to bump it to then if I end up getting that one <br/>
and it worked for anyone else who was interested in coming. <br/>
<br/>
Don't sulk yet!  It could still happen!  But go ahead and eat pie.  <br/>
Because, come on... pie!<br/>

flight attendants to choose the other shifts<br/>

28-31, camping with friends from Canon City CO at the CO National<br/>
Monument cg. That happened with the Moab gathering, too. I was<br/>
scheduled to be there a couple of weeks earlier, but was able to<br/>
change dates to the gathering date. Can't do that this trip because of<br/>
the other folks involved. <br/>
<br/>
BUT -- I will be returning from a car trip to visit family in OK that<br/>
weekend. If I can drive all the way from Tulsa to GJ on Sep 16, I can<br/>
be there the 17th. NEVER MIND! I just checked with Mapquest and there<br/>
is no way I can drive 14 hours in one day! :-P What time are you<br/>
planning to hold this shindig? I can possibly get to Denver in one day<br/>
and do the other 4 hours the morning of the 17th. Even better if you<br/>
get your schedule, Es, and are available the 18th instead.<br/>
<br/>
I will stay tuned as schedules develop and hope to make this party!<br/>
