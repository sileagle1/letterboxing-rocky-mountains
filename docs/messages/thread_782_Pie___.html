list, some of you may find this story hard to believe, but I assure <br/>
you it is absolutely true.<br/>
<br/>
I was taking a tiny walk this morning when I discovered a lost dog.  <br/>
Springer spaniel, I think.  Anyway, I decided to take the dog along <br/>
with me to see if I could find it a home.  I continued my walk a <br/>
little further up the road, when, lo and behold, right there in the <br/>
woods, no lie, I discovered someone had left... (drum roll please)... <br/>
a pie!  Honest!  It was delicious, too, a sort of chocolately, <br/>
marmallowey, graham crackery thing.  I even gave the dog some.  And <br/>
even better, a little further up the trail someone had left me an icy <br/>
cold tasty soda to wash it down with!  Unbelievable!  What a day!  <br/>
Sometimes life is good.<br/>
