Kat, I just wanted to let you know that Spring Dog '05 made it to a <br>
box in Colorado!  I just noticed that at the HH website, it shows that <br>
Blackvelvet picked him up at the gathering.  That's wrong, it was me <br>
and Cappy that found him and brought him to Colorado.  Sorry if we <br>
somehow confused you!  All you Colorado boxers, he's waiting to Hitch <br>
hike his way to a new box!  Ruff!  Ruff!<br>
<br>
Hugs, Dixie Peach<br>
