Ravenwolf - -  will be glad to meet you.  I have seen your stamps in <br/>
so many journals.  We are  also from Littleton.  We are not sure yet <br/>

You guys are all too sweet! We are also looking forward to meeting <br/>
some of these people that have some Oh-so-cool-stamps in other folks' <br/>
log books!<br/>

And we are also traveling 300 miles to meet people that probably <br/>
don't live more than 15 miles from us. That's okay - we've never been <br/>
to Moab before, and this is sooooo worth it! Well, it will be if we <br/>

Can someone post again where the park is or the name of the park where <br/>
we are gathering?? I think I know, but someone else may not know - <br/>
now, I am not admitting that it is me, but someone else.!!!  <br/>

I am hoping someone can help me find that onion this Summer.  My <br/>
mentor's Tai Chi and Chi Tea already found it.  TDG hope you find it <br/>

It will be at 750 Millcreek Drive at Rotary Park.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to a map:<br/>

searchtype=address&amp;country=US&amp;addtohistory=&amp;searchtab=home&amp;address=750+M<br/>
illcreek+Dr&amp;city=Moab&amp;state=UT&amp;zipcode=<br/>
<br/>
Or you can ask anybody where Rotary Park is,<br/>
<br/>
Or you can follow the line of eccentric looking people with compasses <br/>
and ink all over their fingers.<br/>

Ok, here are some more directions in addition to the map, just in <br/>
case! Downtown is small, and mostly on a grid, so it's easy to find <br/>
anything, and anyone will help with directions!<br/>
<br/>
 Remember that the Colorado River is North of town, so if you are <br/>
heading into town driving South down Main St., the easiest way is to <br/>
turn Left (east)(towards the mountains) on 200 South and head to 400 <br/>
East. 200 South will deadend on 400 East, then turn right and look for <br/>
Dave's Corner Market. Turn Left again, this is Millcreek, and Rotary <br/>
Park is just up this street on the right side, across from Redrock <br/>
Elementary School. You will be following the signs for the Slickrock <br/>
Bike Trail, which is a few miles farther up this road!<br/>
<br/>
As of now, there is a winter storm coming on Saturday, with cold temps <br/>
and lots of wind. Sunday is supposed to get warmer and clear up. Now <br/>
keep in mind that our weather reports come from Salt Lake City, which <br/>
is 4 hours away, and they are not very accurate with our weather. It <br/>
could miss Moab altogether, cross fingers and let's give collective <br/>
happy weather thoughts into the airwaves!!!<br/>

  Ok, here are some more directions in addition to the map, just in <br/>
  case! Downtown is small, and mostly on a grid, so it's easy to find <br/>
  anything, and anyone will help with directions!<br/>
<br/>
  Remember that the Colorado River is North of town, so if you are <br/>
  heading into town driving South down Main St., the easiest way is to <br/>
  turn Left (east)(towards the mountains) on 200 South and head to 400 <br/>
  East. 200 South will deadend on 400 East, then turn right and look for <br/>
  Dave's Corner Market. Turn Left again, this is Millcreek, and Rotary <br/>
  Park is just up this street on the right side, across from Redrock <br/>
  Elementary School. You will be following the signs for the Slickrock <br/>
  Bike Trail, which is a few miles farther up this road!<br/>
<br/>
  As of now, there is a winter storm coming on Saturday, with cold temps <br/>
  and lots of wind. Sunday is supposed to get warmer and clear up. Now <br/>
  keep in mind that our weather reports come from Salt Lake City, which <br/>
  is 4 hours away, and they are not very accurate with our weather. It <br/>
  could miss Moab altogether, cross fingers and let's give collective <br/>
  happy weather thoughts into the airwaves!!!<br/>

  &gt; Can someone post again where the park is or the name of the park <br/>
  where <br/>
  &gt; we are gathering?? I think I know, but someone else may not know - <br/>
  &gt; now, I am not admitting that it is me, but someone else.!!!  <br/>
  &gt; probably.    Puppypaws (being a little absent minded)<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I am hoping someone can help me find that onion this Summer.  My <br/>
  &gt; mentor's Tai Chi and Chi Tea already found it.  TDG hope you find it <br/>
  &gt; this week end, let me know.   I am still reserving April 30 to go <br/>
  with <br/>
  &gt; you to Co. Spgs for a day of LBing.<br/>
