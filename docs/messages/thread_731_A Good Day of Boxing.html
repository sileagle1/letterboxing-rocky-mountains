We had another fairly successful day in the Littleton area boxing.  We found<br>
the Onion, Blue Heron, Ride the Platte River, Bite My Shiny Letterbox, The<br>
Lemony Letterbox, Turtles Can't Fly, The Master's Vision.  One of these<br>
boxes now also holds a nice surprise for the next finder.  We also attempted<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It looks as though Dilbox was washed out of its hiding place due to <br>
the recent rains, so we are assuming someone picked it up and decided <br>
to keep it rather than contacting us.  I would probably feel worse <br>
about it in light of the recently missing "Have a Homebrew" but we <br>
just got back from vacation in Florida where almost all of the LBs <br>
around WDW have gone missing since the beginning of the year.  We were <br>
looking forward to doing some LBing and dropping off a few HHs (which <br>
we will now need to drop off around here), but we had a great time <br>
anyway.  At least I know it is not only us having these problems and <br>
I'm glad to hear that Lemony and Bite My Shiny are still where they <br>
are supposed to be.<br>
