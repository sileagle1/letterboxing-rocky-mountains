<br>
I haven't posted in awhile, but I've had an interesting LBing issue <br>
arise. I had a guy email me that he was walking his dogs, found my box <br>
lying in plain sight and thought it looked like a fun thing to do. I <br>
emailed back, asking about the condition, etc, and requesting that he <br>
put it back so I could retrieve it. He emailed back and said he was <br>
going to carve a new stamp for it! I emailed back and asked him to <br>
please just put it back...he emailed back and said he would put it back <br>
after he finished carving the stamp! I'm not quite sure what to do with <br>
it if he ever does put it back, since it won't be my stamp and possibly <br>
not even my journal? He hasn't told me if the journal was still in it. <br>
I'm glad the guy is interested and thinks this is fun, but apparently <br>
he doesn't quite get the idea of it. For now, I'm just going to list <br>
the box as missing and see what happens, I guess. It was one of my <br>
Wildflowers boxes and had had LOTS of visitors since I placed it almost <br>
two years ago. Sigh.<br>
