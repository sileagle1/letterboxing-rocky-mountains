So excited that we're coming to Moab.  I can't believe it.  Yippee!!!  <br/>
We leave early in the morning (Friday) and I still have so much to do <br/>
before we hit the road.  This week has been busy so I haven't been on <br/>
the internet much and am sure I've missed tons of info.  I did get the <br/>
latest directions to the gathering so hopefully that's enough.  =-) <br/>
<br/>
See you all soon and I look forward to meeting you all.  <br/>
