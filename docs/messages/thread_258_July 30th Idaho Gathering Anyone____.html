<br>
Greetings Fellow Letterboxers some who live close to me and some who <br>
live not so close.<br>
<br>
We have a rare treat coming up on Friday, July 30th in that Silver <br>
Eagle and Baby Bear (both letterboxers from Texas) are passing <br>
through the Boise area and would like to meet as many of us as <br>
possible.  So if you're available that night to meet and greet please <br>
let me know.<br>
<br>
I'm thinking maybe meeting at my place in Star that night around 7pm. <br>
I can provide home made pizza and we can exchange stamps and meet.  <br>
<br>
I will be out of town 16-25 July on a short missions trip down to <br>
Mexico so if you email me, don't be sad that I haven't written you <br>
back as I'll be back the 25th and able to correspond again then.  <br>
<br>
So email me if you're interested. and I can arrange it.  Thanks so <br>
much.  Also if you know of other letterboxers that might be <br>
interested let me too.    <br>
<br>
Have a blessed day.<br>
Aryn Alyssa  (aka A-Bear)<br>
