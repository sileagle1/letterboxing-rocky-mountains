You can't really go wrong with any of the boxes in the Moab area. But <br>
I kinda like the Ticaboo and Lulu's day out series. It's a short walk <br>
but you feel really secluded. And I like Searching... for the same <br>
reason. And Dead Horse Point is a fun letterbox with just amazing <br>
views.<br>
<br>
I'm afraid that at the end of March I'll be eating dehydrated food <br>
and only dreaming of pie. My kids and I will be backpacking near <br>
Canyonlands in an obscure place called Hatch Wash between Moab and <br>
Monticello. But, please, have a slice for me.<br>

Hello y-nought,<br>
<br>
Thanks for the recommendations.<br>
<br>
Re: having a slice for you, it's my pleasure! I'll be in town on March<br>
21 and/or 22. Where's a good place to get pie in Moab? Please be<br>
specific; I've only been there once and it was in passing.<br>
