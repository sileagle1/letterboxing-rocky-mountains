You can't really go wrong with any of the boxes in the Moab area. But <br/>
I kinda like the Ticaboo and Lulu's day out series. It's a short walk <br/>
but you feel really secluded. And I like Searching... for the same <br/>
reason. And Dead Horse Point is a fun letterbox with just amazing <br/>
views.<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid that at the end of March I'll be eating dehydrated food <br/>
and only dreaming of pie. My kids and I will be backpacking near <br/>
Canyonlands in an obscure place called Hatch Wash between Moab and <br/>
Monticello. But, please, have a slice for me.<br/>

Hello y-nought,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
Re: having a slice for you, it's my pleasure! I'll be in town on March<br/>
21 and/or 22. Where's a good place to get pie in Moab? Please be<br/>
specific; I've only been there once and it was in passing.<br/>
