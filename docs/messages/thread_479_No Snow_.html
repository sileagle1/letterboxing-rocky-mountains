No, Es, I think there is a giant umbrella above Moab, 'cause we <br>
haven't had anything but wind and some clouds. The wind makes life <br>
cooooold right now, so hiking is not the most pleasant prospect here <br>
this weekend. It's more of a crackling fire, baking, and carving <br>
kind of weekend! My left hand box is suffering again. My friends <br>
brought it home a couple of days ago to dry out. Apparently the rock <br>
it sits under seeps water badly in the winter, and the box is not a <br>
good one for keeping water out. Somehow the journal has been spared <br>
both times, but the stamp has suffered from ice and water. Does <br>
anyone know how to repair small chip-outs in stamps?<br>
<br>
Kat (ready for snow anytime since everyone else has been hammered by <br>
storms!!!)<br>
