Cool!  I like the article and I think Jodie and Wilderwomn did a <br/>
great job of "clueing" the author in on some of the more important <br/>
points of letterboxing.<br/>
     And welcome Michelle. Looks like you picked things up pretty <br/>
quickly. Three days and you've already found, placed, and read the <br/>
archives? Neat clues too.<br/>

Thanks! Looks to be a great group...lots of chatter and some great <br/>
stuff in both the archives and the files.<br/>
<br/>
It still feels pretty "grade school", but as with all things, I hope <br/>
we'll (Cuz and I are kind of a team) progress. We kinda decided for <br/>
our first one we'd make it fairly simple but (hopefully) fun.<br/>
<br/>
Now of course, we're on tenterhooks, waiting for the first find.  <br/>
Yeehaaaaw!  ;)<br/>
