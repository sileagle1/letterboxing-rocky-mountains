The mini-meet was a blast.  About 20 boxers in all<br/>
were in attendance.  There were exchanges (along with<br/>
a cootie or two) flying at a fast and furious pace,<br/>
and pre surprised us with a gorgeous event stamp! <br/>
After the exchanges, we broke up into smaller groups<br/>
to tour some of the DOD buildings, and I think that<br/>
everyone found at least one new box this weekend.<br/>

welcome mat on a weekend when a small group of us woulda been out <br/>
exploring anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
Wow oh wow though - did we get a better turn out than I could have <br/>
ever dreamed!  AND the most incredible weather possible (3 for 3 <br/>
years - yay!) I think I got a sunburn...can summer be far behind?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to EVERYONE for coming to Denver this weekend.  It thrills me <br/>
to no end that there was this much interest in the Mile High City.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all had a blast exchanging and 'boxing and exploring.<br/>
<br/>
Who knows?  Maybe we've just started an annual tradition?<br/>
<br/>
Someone else will hopefully have pictures to post, 'cause I sure <br/>
don't have any....<br/>
<br/>
So anybody have some D.O.D. building exploring they'd especially <br/>
like to share with us? For me it was going to the top of the Daniels <br/>
&amp; Fisher Clocktower building.  This was the first year it was open <br/>
for DOD - a 360 view on such a clear day - wow!  Unicorn Girl and <br/>
Trainboy liked the elevator ride.<br/>

With Deutsch Maus we were able to grab Curtain Call - that stamp is<br/>
awesome - thank you - <br/>

Also thanks to Raven Wolf and Gang, we were able to pick up the Union<br/>
Station stamp!  Checked out Lannie Garrett theater, think we should<br/>
all meet to go to a show there, it is a fantastic place. <br/>
