The mini-meet was a blast.  About 20 boxers in all<br>
were in attendance.  There were exchanges (along with<br>
a cootie or two) flying at a fast and furious pace,<br>
and pre surprised us with a gorgeous event stamp! <br>
After the exchanges, we broke up into smaller groups<br>
to tour some of the DOD buildings, and I think that<br>
everyone found at least one new box this weekend.<br>

welcome mat on a weekend when a small group of us woulda been out <br>
exploring anyway.  <br>
<br>
Wow oh wow though - did we get a better turn out than I could have <br>
ever dreamed!  AND the most incredible weather possible (3 for 3 <br>
years - yay!) I think I got a sunburn...can summer be far behind?<br>
<br>
Thanks to EVERYONE for coming to Denver this weekend.  It thrills me <br>
to no end that there was this much interest in the Mile High City.<br>
<br>
Hope you all had a blast exchanging and 'boxing and exploring.<br>
<br>
Who knows?  Maybe we've just started an annual tradition?<br>
<br>
Someone else will hopefully have pictures to post, 'cause I sure <br>
don't have any....<br>
<br>
So anybody have some D.O.D. building exploring they'd especially <br>
like to share with us? For me it was going to the top of the Daniels <br>
& Fisher Clocktower building.  This was the first year it was open <br>
for DOD - a 360 view on such a clear day - wow!  Unicorn Girl and <br>
Trainboy liked the elevator ride.<br>

With Deutsch Maus we were able to grab Curtain Call - that stamp is<br>
awesome - thank you - <br>
<br>
Also thanks to Raven Wolf and Gang, we were able to pick up the Union<br>
Station stamp!  Checked out Lannie Garrett theater, think we should<br>
all meet to go to a show there, it is a fantastic place. <br>
