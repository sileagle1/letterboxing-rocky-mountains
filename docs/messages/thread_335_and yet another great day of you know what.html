                    <div class="plaintext-content">I drove home from Denver today and took the long way.  Was it <br/>
gorgeous today or what?!<br/>
<br/>
Along my journey I finally collared that pesky Onion.  Then I sailed <br/>
up to Bailey and snuck into the Dragon's Lair.  On around the scenic <br/>
route until I pulled up to the dock in Breckenridge and discovered <br/>
Bears Gone Fishin'. <br/>
<br/>
During the long sea journey I managed to check up on Harry's Heaven, <br/>
Twenty Mile and Grizzly Creek, all of which were doing well.  <br/>
Grizzly Creek got new stamp pads... don't tell the other boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Every single box I looked at today was extremely well re-hidden. <br/>
That was really great to see!  A pretty large group with kids had <br/>
done one of them and you could hardly tell there was a box there. <br/>
The sticks and pine needles and rocks were so artfully placed that <br/>
it looked totally natural. <br/>
<br/>
It took me over 8 hours to make a 4 hour drive... and it was worth <br/>
every minute. <br/>
<br/>
Good times!<br/>
