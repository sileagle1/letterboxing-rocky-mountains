to meet us last night. It was a bit snowy, but the atmosphere inside <br/>
the quaint restaurant was lively.  We had fun doing exchanges (we got <br/>
our 500th exchange last night!), stamping in the fantastic event stamp <br/>
that Front Range Hiker created, pasing around various cooties and <br/>
sharing lots of boxing stories.<br/>
<br/>
The food was great and it was nice to make some new friends in this <br/>
part of the country.  If any of you come to the Milwaukee area of <br/>
Wisconsin, please let us know, so we can get together again!<br/>
<br/>
If  you'd like to see a group photo from the mini-meet, I posted one in <br/>
the Photos section of this message board.  Here's a direct link to it:<br/>

And there was most definitely PIE!  Some was "PREtend pie" which was <br/>
supposed to be peach, but looked suspiciously like blueberry or <br/>
cherry...<br/>
<br/>
Mmmmmm!<br/>
<br/>
Good times!<br/>
