and with the Engraver and Corrina, who were working their way back <br>
home to Connecticut from the Live and Breathe event in Oregon.  They <br>
have found more letterboxes on this trip than I've found, well, ever!  <br>
And they have some great stories to share about their adventures.<br>
<br>
I just got a message from them that they will be in Colorado by <br>
Sunday.  Is anyone free for a mini-meet on Sunday?  I have the Race <br>
for the Cure in the morning, so it would probably be coffee in the <br>
afternoon or maybe dinner.  Once I get a sense of who is coming, we <br>
can pick a place.<br>
