Or at a very minimum could one count this as some kinda "extra" in <br/>

I don't find anything, yet, online about this, nor in Randy Hall's <br/>

Not trying to bag finds, just wondering what the heck one does in a <br/>

<br/>
As far as finding a box that had no stamp, and then asking a friend to <br/>
get the stamp image later, I would say go for it, but try to get back <br/>
later and stamp it yourself.<br/>
<br/>
As far as counting it goes....that is pretty much up to you. There are <br/>
so many different ways to count letterboxes that it becomes apples and <br/>
oranges after a while. I have never heard of anybody counting in <br/>
fractions before, so you might want to try that. Maybe eleven <br/>
sixteenths of a box until you get back over there and get the remaining <br/>
five sixteenths.<br/>
<br/>
As far as finding a mystery box that hadn't been attempted in two <br/>
years.......BooYa! That is awesome! Just hearing that makes me lust for <br/>
letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said......just my dos pesos,<br/>
