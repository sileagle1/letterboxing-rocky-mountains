What's your feeling for this being "kosher" should a copy of the <br>

not even?<br>
<br>
Or at a very minimum could one count this as some kinda "extra" in <br>
one's own log, but not as an actual find?<br>
<br>
I don't find anything, yet, online about this, nor in Randy Hall's <br>
book.<br>

Not trying to bag finds, just wondering what the heck one does in a <br>

<br>
As far as finding a box that had no stamp, and then asking a friend to <br>
get the stamp image later, I would say go for it, but try to get back <br>
later and stamp it yourself.<br>
<br>
As far as counting it goes....that is pretty much up to you. There are <br>
so many different ways to count letterboxes that it becomes apples and <br>
oranges after a while. I have never heard of anybody counting in <br>
fractions before, so you might want to try that. Maybe eleven <br>
sixteenths of a box until you get back over there and get the remaining <br>
five sixteenths.<br>
<br>
As far as finding a mystery box that hadn't been attempted in two <br>
years.......BooYa! That is awesome! Just hearing that makes me lust for <br>
letterboxes.<br>
<br>
Like I said......just my dos pesos,<br>
