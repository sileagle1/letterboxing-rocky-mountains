                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hehe!  Well - you have to start somewhere, right?<br>
<br>
I'm in the Denver area - Aurora specifically.  I think Dixie is in <br>
Ken Caryl Valley.<br>
<br>
So Julie - have you found the Fox Run Park box?  I was concerned <br>
about driving down for it since it was planted awhile back and the <br>
planter seems to have vanished.  I think it was awesome of you to <br>
offer to adopt the box!  I hope they let you do it.<br>
<br>
As for the trail names - my choice would be for each family member to <br>
have a trail name of their own, and maybe a "team" name for the <br>
family.  Example:  Guara of the Monument Bouquet, while someone else <br>
could be Columbine of the Monument Bouquet.  (I'm just using flowers <br>
as an example) - This way, all three of you could stamp individually, <br>
but when you're not all 3 together, you could stamp alone.  Kids LOVE <br>
to have their own stamp and "secret" name!  :)  No rules!<br>

Fledgling is right. I went to read the archives. Giggle!<br>
 <br>
I'm in Monument. Where are you two?<br>
 <br>
Question: I'm considering Gaura (a flower that looks like butterflies <br>
have landed on it - I do landscape design) for my trailname, but <br>
should be choose individual names or a family name? I mean, if all <br>
three of us go out, would we stamp three times, or is it better to <br>
have a "family" stamp. Thanks!<br>
