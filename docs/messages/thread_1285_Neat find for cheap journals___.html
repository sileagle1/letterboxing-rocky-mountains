found these little keychain notepads... they are about 2 1/4 x 3 inches <br>
and mostly black... they have a strip that says NASCAR across the <br>
front, but that could be easily covered up.  And the pages aren't <br>
lined.  Anyway, I thought it would be a good idea for box journals, so <br>
I picked a bunch up. Just wanted to share. (they're not spiral-bound, <br>
unfortunately).<br>
