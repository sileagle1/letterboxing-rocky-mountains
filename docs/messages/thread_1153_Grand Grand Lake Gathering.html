Depending on Aljan to do her Sundance to chase away those thunderstorms!<br>
<br>
Husband Al (Beemer Rider - brand new convert!) and I are staying at<br>
one of the Western Riviera condo guest rooms. Bringing munchies and<br>
hopefully a pie to share; chicken for the grill. Aljan, do you need us<br>
to bring paper plates or plastic forks or hillbilly napkins for the group?<br>
<br>
The plan is to hide a letterbox at the park temporarily for the event<br>
and then permanently elsewhere before we leave town. That way you can<br>
find it twice! But you'll have to come back for the second time<br>
because clues won't be posted until after we get home.<br>
