My spell check doesn't do "pirate" so I'll stick with so-so English.  We<br>
had to help a friend move this weekend to SE Denver and decided to stop<br>
into my old stomping grounds around Parker.  Picked up Esmeralda's two<br>
boxes.  They are beautiful and in fine shape.  I am becoming quite the<br>
Esmeralda fan.  I want to go to the Cherry Creek reservior and the Plains<br>
Center next time we are down that way.  Has anybody been there?<br>
