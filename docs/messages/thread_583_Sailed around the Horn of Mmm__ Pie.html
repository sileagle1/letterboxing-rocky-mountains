Actually, we sailed around the horn of Vancouver.  On the fifth day <br>
when the last Canuck was leaving the plane in San Diego I came <br>
**THIS** close to saying, 'Take off, EH?!' as he stepped onto the <br>
jetway.  <br>
<br>
30 people?! Garrrrrrrr!!! That be excitin'!!  Now all ye needs is a <br>
clear sky and a table load of pie!  <br>
<br>
They'll be posting our schedules for that time in a week, so I'll <br>
know then.  As much as I'd love to, won't be able to call in sick.  <br>
They're really really really really mean and even if you are in the <br>
hospital having something you really need surgically reattached, you <br>
get an occurance.. five in 12 months and it's 'hasta la vista <br>
baybee..maybe McDonald's is hiring'.  But.. not givin' up until the <br>
crew trackers sing.  I'm pinin' to meet all ye scurvey, pie lovin' <br>
boxers. <br>
<br>
Es, dreaming of a Table of Glory creaking under it's load of <br>
treasure.. pie, pie and more pie... arrrrrr<br>
