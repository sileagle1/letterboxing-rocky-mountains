I have a plan - If you can get your HH to Moab, I will be there     <br>
(hiking and looking for pie and boxes) in April.   Then, I will get <br>
your HH to Kokomo, Indiana and someone can take it further north if <br>
needed.  I just placed a box in Kokomo (there are only two in <br>
town).  How's that?  I live in Colorado -  Puppypaws of Littleton<br>

Hello Puppypaws,<br>
<br>
Are you still planning your trip to Moab in April?<br>
<br>
I will check to see if the HH wanting to get to IN is still<br>
lanquishing in the LB here in Ogden.  If it is, I will take it with me<br>
to Moab and place it in a box there for you to pick up in April.  That<br>
is, if your plans are still a go. I will be down in Moab on March 21<br>
and/or 22.  Do you have any ideas about which box there to hide it in?<br>
<br>
Boxer Lover<br>

I lived in Aurora 1979-1984.  <br>
