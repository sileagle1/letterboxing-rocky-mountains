                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yarrrrrr...this be big fun! The whole town has gone piratey (it'll be <br>
a long week for poor La Paloma), but the most fun be on the <br>
RMLetterboxers list as usual.<br>
<br>
Two years ago the treasure was hidden in the very outhouse used for <br>
the outhouse stuffing. Y did a dance about the whole thing feeling <br>
it's sides and all....but didn't think to look in the vent flue up <br>
top, Garrrrh! But that reminds me about the days of outhouse oriented <br>
clues that lead up to that fateful day. <br>
<br>
So...looking for a theme, here are all the clues up to this point <br>
with the latest one added. I probably won't be able to check in until <br>
tomorrow, but I'll update you about our snoop around town when I can:<br>
<br>
1) Look at the aft of the map. (Behind a Chamber Map or outdoor map <br>
or map on the poster or brochure?)<br>
<br>
2) From West Derby look towards New Mexico. (They played baseball in <br>
derby hats. Also West Derby is in Englandnorth of Liverpool)<br>
<br>
3) I'm thinking of a number between 2 and nay, (neigh?). (Nay is <br>
Indian for wind, April Wind is a shop on Main.Nay also means <br>
NO.Neigh for wild horse saloon).<br>
<br>
   4) You won't need a shovel to dig for this treasure. ( you might <br>
need an Oar?)<br>
<br>
5) You are being watched. (This could mean the web-cam that is at<br>
College and Main, although there is another one run by CDOT at 550<br>
and 160 by the Doubletree Inn that is on the south side of town).<br>
<br>
6) The treasure you seek is not in plain sight. (Not on the plains <br>
but in Mountains..Pedal the Peaks? Not in Plain sight, but in the <br>
website?)<br>
<br>
7) A New German directs you to look to the sunrise. (New Germany is a<br>
town in Minnesota----Minnesota Vikings? I don't know of any Germans<br>
or Vikings pointing east in town.MennonitesSt. Pauli Girl).<br>
<br>
8) You'll find it at a lower altitude than last year. (That could<br>
mean about anywhere in town, because the disc golf course is on the<br>
mesa with the College above town).<br>
<br>
9) How would you say that in Spanish? (Gold in Spanish is OroOre <br>
House).<br>

Oh and let's not forget last year the person who found th bullet only <br>

Sorry guys on my typing my brain KNOWS what I mean but then my <br>
fingers type the opposite (wrong end of boat, higher elevation than <br>
last year when I MEANT lower) and on this front I'm stuck on "not in <br>

to dig...dunno why I'm stuck on UP.  <br>

Oh dang missed the spanish part when I was going on about German <br>

<br>
We ate right by the Ore House and walked around and around and didn't <br>
see anything to DO or anywhere to LOOK. The big sign with EAST on the <br>
rising sun was across the street and everything else made perfect <br>
sense, looked inside and at the menu, but really there was no place <br>
accessible to hide the bullet that we could see. We might have to go <br>
back again, but we just ran out of possibilities tonight.<br>
<br>
So we went to Plan B. There is a big sign with a map at the welcome <br>
center at Santa Rita Park. We looked around some more and there is a <br>
big obvious statue of horses just across the parking lot from the train <br>
they are restoring (the one from Around The World In Eighty Days). So <br>
Choo and Neigh makes sense there, but what's the number? It was getting <br>
really dark by then so we quit, but I think it's a real possibility <br>
there. Also, it's right by the whitewater park (Oars). <br>
<br>
Elros said that the New German Car is a Rabbit (well, kinda new) so <br>
that's another possibility. But that one still has me baffled.<br>
<br>
It was glorious tonight when we saw the Jolly Roger flying with a <br>
spotlight on it three stories above Main Avenue.<br>
<br>
Clue #10) It's accessible 24/7 but questions may be asked.<br>
<br>
There is an 80% chance of snow here tonight, so I might be up at 4am to <br>
plow. <br>
<br>
I'll talk to ye hearties when next I can. Thanks for all the <br>
brainstormin'.<br>

I was SO gonna ask that Q earlier dixie, but said "NO I'm doing a <br>
good enough job on the RM list with "ppl think I'm weird and stream <br>
of consciousness typing/thiking" ..Enough!  <br>
<br>
Was on the ore house website earlier and said "dang" they have some <br>
GOOD hiding spots!!  Self editing...boo!<br>
<br>
First rule of letterboxing...KEEP looking.  I'm like a maniac that <br>
way when I just "know/sense ....dang it I think I'm in the right <br>
place!<br>
<br>
Ok what about look up in the sign over the road..."no need <br>
for ..long hooks" ...is that how the line read? on the <br>
outhouse...erm....text.<br>
<br>
Ok now I'm in major urban boxing stealth mode.  I sense it in me <br>
very BONES!....so ferking close on Tuesday (not Thursday!) I can <br>
taste it.  Grrrrrr  Note: Joly/Jely Rogers are made <br>
of ...bones...and flags....<br>

Eyeeeeeeeeeee mateys.   I hate it when me "PREmonition" knows <br>
something but not exactly ....what....!!<br>

Ore House?  I thought if you looked on the back it would give you a <br>
last clue or something.  <br>
<br>
That last clue about 24/7, but questions may be asked.  It sounds to <br>
me that that means that if caught by the wrong people, they may ask <br>
you what you're doing!  Could it be that banner hanging over Main <br>
St. like PRE suggested?  Someone would surely question what you were <br>
doing!  hhhhmmmmmm<br>
<br>
This all sounds interesting...is the location near a CAM???<br>

Hey scurvy crew-<br>
<br>
We ate right by the Ore House and walked around and around and didn't <br>
see anything to DO or anywhere to LOOK. The big sign with EAST on the <br>
rising sun was across the street and everything else made perfect <br>
sense, looked inside and at the menu, but really there was no place <br>
accessible to hide the bullet that we could see. We might have to go <br>
back again, but we just ran out of possibilities tonight.<br>
<br>
So we went to Plan B. There is a big sign with a map at the welcome <br>
center at Santa Rita Park. We looked around some more and there is a <br>
big obvious statue of horses just across the parking lot from the train <br>
they are restoring (the one from Around The World In Eighty Days). So <br>
Choo and Neigh makes sense there, but what's the number? It was getting <br>
really dark by then so we quit, but I think it's a real possibility <br>
there. Also, it's right by the whitewater park (Oars). <br>
<br>
Elros said that the New German Car is a Rabbit (well, kinda new) so <br>
that's another possibility. But that one still has me baffled.<br>
<br>
It was glorious tonight when we saw the Jolly Roger flying with a <br>
spotlight on it three stories above Main Avenue.<br>
<br>
Clue #10) It's accessible 24/7 but questions may be asked.<br>
<br>
There is an 80% chance of snow here tonight, so I might be up at 4am to <br>
plow. <br>
<br>
I'll talk to ye hearties when next I can. Thanks for all the <br>
brainstormin'.<br>

There be a lot for this poor landlubber to ponder here.<br>
<br>
We only got 2 inches of snow so far, so I'm finished with me plowin' <br>
already.<br>
<br>
Some thoughts on what I've been reading:<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure it's not on the roof of El Rancho Tavern with Jolly <br>
Roger. There was an incident where the cops were called because <br>
people were sneaking up on rooftops looking for the bullet. Also, <br>
EVERY store front in Durango has a poster and a few skull and <br>
crossbones decorations.<br>
<br>
I'm sticking with Plan B for now. There IS a tower with a clock on it <br>
at the sewage treatment plant next to Santa Rita Park.<br>
<br>
Clue 11) The First Time is Very Confusing. (That TIME thing again).<br>
<br>
12) Tee it up and hit it into the sunset. (The golf course is either <br>
WAY up the valley, or by the College on the mesa).<br>
<br>
As PRE said, there are no wrong ideas in brainstorming and I'll <br>
seriously consider every lead and idea I can get. I'll have to go <br>
with my hunch when it comes to where I'm going to search, though. I <br>
will definitely keep in mind things like Kinder, Neu, Este and Esta, <br>
the number One, and the possibility that these spots will make an X <br>
on a map.<br>
<br>
Side note, we went by Into The Lense yesterday and saw a picture of <br>
Oprah dressed in Wild West Duds, from her visit last summer. She <br>
posed with her publicist and a portrait of our favorite Western <br>
Showman....Buffalo Bill Cody.<br>
<br>
One more thing that occurred to me: We are searching for a SILVER <br>
bullet. Not all treasure is Gold, mates. Spanish for Silver is La <br>
Plata which is the name of the county that Durango is in. So I might <br>
need to look at the County Road and Bridge Yard and the County <br>
Courthouse and maybe even the DMV (???)<br>
<br>
If nought for the spirit of the fearless crew the Y would be lost!<br>
