                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am getting pretty excited. I took in a new roommate. When she asked if <br>
there was anything she should know about me, I told her I had a couple of <br>
obsessions that might intrude into daily life--one was the new Harry Potter <br>
book coming out (in 9 days!!!) and the other, of course, is letterboxing. I <br>
went through the typical "What's that?" explanation, but they actually <br>
seemed intrigued, so I kept talking. Well they kept asking questions and my <br>
new roommate and her boyfriend both went the next day and looked up the main <br>
websites and called me asking me to take them out. When I asked if they <br>
wanted me to carve personal stamps for them, they responded "no way, we want <br>
to carve our own. Can you teach us?" Can I teach them?!! :)<br>
 Last night he chose a possible trail name, drew his own stamp, and carved <br>
it entirely by himself (and did pretty darn good too). She is still deciding <br>
on how she wants to do hers but we may head up into the mountains Saturday <br>
to find some boxes. Oooh, I'm salivating at the thought!<br>
