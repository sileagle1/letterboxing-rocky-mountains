<br>
Hopalong and I found the Fox Run box on Saturday. Inside was an <br>
apparently newly-released HH. I can't find it on either the LBNA site <br>
or AQ. <br>
<br>
It is called "The Gray Squirrels HH" and was released on October 22. <br>
The stamp says "Maine" and has a carving of a lobster, but there's <br>
absolutely no information on who placed it!<br>
<br>
Anyone know anything about this?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
