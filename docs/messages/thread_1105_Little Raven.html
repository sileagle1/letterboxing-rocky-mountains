                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found it back in January and found the bearing and pace count (even <br/>
allowing for the uphill walk) to both be quite off.  Almost gave up on <br/>
this box, but on the way back down the hill checked out one last group <br/>
of rocks and found it there. <br/>
<br/>
I too doubt anyone would be up that way and your box is probably fine, <br/>
but thought I should mention my experience in case your attempter had <br/>
the same one.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't want to "volunteer" FRH, but know she's up that way (but has <br/>
been out of town most of this week), so if she's not willing to check <br/>
up on it, I'd be happy to do so, next time I'm up that way.<br/>
<br/>
Just let me know.<br/>
