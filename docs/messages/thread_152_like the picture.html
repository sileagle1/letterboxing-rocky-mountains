maybe cross country . . . hmm, decisions, decisions.  ah, blast!  I <br/>
forgot I have a symphony rehearsal that day--maybe I can get a <br/>
half day pass.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, let me share a personal moment that made me <br/>
smile a bit.  My little sister and her husband have decided to <br/>
move out to Florida.  I was talking to her about how that felt so far <br/>
away and I had to admit I was having a bit of a pity party over <br/>
feeling like I wouldn't be able to see her or my nieces much <br/>
anymore.  Much as I tried to not let her hear it on the phone, I <br/>
must admit, I started to cry some.  My sister (a non letterboxer <br/>
who sometimes mocks how involved I've become with this) <br/>
immediately started trying to comfort me and jumped in saying, <br/>
"don't worry Jana, we can plant lots and lots of letterboxes for you <br/>
and then you will want to come out all the time.  We'll get a <br/>
letterboxing Mecca going for you!"  I had to laugh that in trying to <br/>
comfort me the first thing out of her mouth is a letterboxing <br/>
comment.  Now I know her enough to know she won't plant for <br/>
me, but I had to giggle a bit at her attempt to comfort me.  I guess <br/>
that it's a sign that I'm hooked good. :-)  Don't you love family?<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd share with the group.<br/>
<br/>
till later,<br/>
