Hopefully once you have all returned from the Ren. Faire but before <br/>
you fill the board with your wonderful tales (which I look forward to <br/>
reading, as The H-A's have family in town and aren't able to make the <br/>
gathering), you can each give me your two cents on a question:<br/>
<br/>
If a letterboxer really, really likes a stamp, is it considered a <br/>
breach of etiquette to rub said stamp against your body?<br/>
<br/>
See the Photos section, the picture called Mr. Cody before you answer.<br/>

I LOVE the stamp too but don't think it would look good on me! <br/>
