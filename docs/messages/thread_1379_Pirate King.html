I had my family pull Charlotte yesterday after receiving a report that <br/>

Some of it may have survived, but I know that the journal is pretty <br/>
much gone.  So.  I haven't decided if I'll redo it and replant.  I'll <br/>
let you know if it returns.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll be rechecking the rest of the boxes as time and distance permits.  <br/>
If any of those are lost I'll give the current searchers an update as I <br/>
find out. <br/>

Es, touched that you would drive so far to check it<br/>

I can understand that some people don't "get" how this works. They may <br/>
not even realize what a priveledge it is to recieve clues to this <br/>
series. But when the instructions on the clues and in the box so <br/>
clearly ask finders to repack everything to exactly it's original state <br/>
I just can't grasp why it would be left in shambles.<br/>
<br/>
But I also sincerely hope that this box gets replaced. It truly is a <br/>
treasure and I would feel a greater loss if it were gone forever.<br/>

<br/>
I've had a chance to visit with 'the Keepers of <br/>
Charlotte'. ::laughs::  Their first response had been to race out to <br/>
rescue her and their first glance looked disasterous.  This was the <br/>
conversation: <br/>
<br/>
Colorado Celt -"Greek! Charlotte is in danger!  Go get her now!" <br/>
<br/>
The Greek looks up from his lunch and says, "Now?  Can I get it after <br/>
lunch?"<br/>
<br/>
CC -  "NO! We are the keepers!"<br/>
<br/>
With grim determination The Greek pushes back his chair and mounts <br/>
the rescue mission immediately.<br/>
<br/>
After close examination (with lots of frowning Mom faces and muttered <br/>
threats to unknown boxers), CC determines that only the journal is <br/>
ruined.  Which is the saddest loss of all to me because of the <br/>
wonderful history it held.  But the main 'prop' (you Pirate King <br/>
Alumni know of what I speak) is fine as is everything else.  Aside <br/>
from the loss of the stamps in there, CC tells me that the box was <br/>
left sitting in it's spot with a single rock on it and the 'marker' <br/>
off to the side.  Now, those of you who have been there know what <br/>
that must have looked like!  ::laughs::  Something out of a <br/>
Frankenstein movie. <br/>
<br/>
I'm a little ashamed to have made such a big deal out of a box full <br/>
of trinkets and papers.  But, like Y said, it's not like it doesn't <br/>
say 127 times that you have to repack it carefully and rehide it <br/>
completely if you want to play.  But there you go.  I know who it was <br/>
and they are pretty much blacklisted for all my boxes in the future.  <br/>
Just sayin'.  <br/>
<br/>
So, no worries.  And thanks to everyone for the lovely notes and <br/>
comments.  If Charlotte returns those of you who are wonderful boxers <br/>
will know and be invited to visit her.  <br/>
<br/>
Es, who can think of lots more important things to be worried about.  <br/>
Like that pie shop in Colorado Springs getting shut down by the IRS.  <br/>
