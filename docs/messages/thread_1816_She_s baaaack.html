boxing, I'm coming down to do some planting tomorrow!  YAY!  It will be<br/>
the return of Fodor and one, maybe two NEW Halloween boxes.  The man,<br/>
starting to toy with idea of MallardMan as his trail name, as opposed to<br/>
being Aljan's Man, is trying to convince me to keep a box meant for<br/>
California here in Colorado cuz it's so darn cool!  (And he knows that I<br/>
will pout and whine when it goes missing in CA like all of my other boxes<br/>
out there have, thinking that if we keep it here, we can keep a better eye<br/>
on it)<br/>
<br/>
YAY!  ~Aljan<br/>
