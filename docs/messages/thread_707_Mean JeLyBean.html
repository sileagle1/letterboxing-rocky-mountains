http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?<br>
boxnum=15390&boxname=Big_Brain_Box<br>
<br>
Metriona Bicolor seemed too easy for a few folks, (including one <br>
gentleman--who shall remain nameless but his name is y-nought--who <br>
seemed to have been able to solve it without using the clues!), so I <br>
decided to kick it up a notch as Emeril would say.<br>
<br>
Now, how to even find the clues...?<br>
<br>
Happy 'Boxing,<br>
