Hi all!  It's been ages since I posted in, but we finally did some <br>
New Year's Eve letterboxing and we want to report to the Splendid <br>
Buccaneers that both of these two letterboxes are doing fine!  What <br>
a beautiful day today!  I was so excited to see both of these <br>
stamps!  WOW!!!!  For those of you who haven't found these, you MUST <br>
go!  The stamps are absolutely SPLENDID! And the home made log books <br>
you must see to appreciate! <br>
<br>
Jodi, I too have a a new grandbaby, well, 10 months old now!  He's a <br>
sweetie!  We wanted to plant our first box but have never carved <br>
before and now with all the wonderful stamps we're finding, we're a <br>
bit intimidated!  We have some ideas but can't seem to get the them <br>
to transfer easily to the rubber....can anyone help me??? <br>
<br>
Happy NEW year to all!  Have a fruitful letterbox year in 2005!  <br>
Hopefully, we will get out there to find more of your boxes this <br>
year! <br>
<br>
Thanks again to ES and the Splendid Buccaneers for the FUN boxes!   <br>

I draw my design out with pencil and then just flip it over onto my carving medium (drawing side down then) and then rub, draw...  how do I say it...  blacken the whole drawing area on the backside and when I lift it up the design has transfered. <br>
