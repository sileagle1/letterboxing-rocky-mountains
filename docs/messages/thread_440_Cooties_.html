Cooties are a new kind of parasite type thingy. I don't really know <br>
that much about them, but they were thought up by some Northwest <br>
boxers and have spread. Atlasquest has a thread on them that started <br>
innocently enough, but somehow flared up into a small fire. <br>
<br>
Mmmmm ..... roasted cooties.<br>
<br>

Well, let me start with a disclaimer and say that I only know what I <br>
have learned from the thread on Atlasquest. <br>
<br>
They were invented by Pandora et al as a fun thing for kids to do at <br>
gatherings or exchanges. You give people Cooties in person by <br>
slipping them into their hand, pocket, backpack, etc... You DON"T <br>
leave them in letterboxes. When you get Cooties you stamp in with <br>
your fingerprint, so kids without personal stamps can play, and then <br>
you try to give Cooties to someone else. <br>
<br>
This wouldn't work very well for me because I've never met another <br>
letterboxer in person (besides those in my family). So I will have to <br>
get Cooties the old fashioned way......by being kissed by a <br>
girl.....ewwwww!<br>

If you were kissing a girl, she might slip a cootie into your <br>
backpack.  Then you'd have double cooties.  And you need <br>
professional help to get rid of that. I saw it on Springer.<br>
<br>
I thought the whole cooties thing looked fun, too, but I'm not into <br>
the fingerprint thing.  I know one group of people have started a <br>
kind of hybrid cootie where you use stamps, but it looks like the <br>
originators aren't too keen on it.  Of course, that whole getting <br>
close enough to another letterboxer to slip the cootie into their <br>
pocket thing is the real challenge.  Skeetch would be all, 'dang it, <br>
Es, stop putting these in my golf bag!'  And I'd whine and say, 'but <br>
you're the only letterboxer around here for a billion miles!'  And <br>
he'd say, 'I'm not a letterboxer! Now stop it!'  And I'd chuckle <br>
because I just stuffed another cootie into his tool box. <br>
<br>
When we come down the mountain from visiting the bard, everyone will <br>
be infested with cooties. <br>
