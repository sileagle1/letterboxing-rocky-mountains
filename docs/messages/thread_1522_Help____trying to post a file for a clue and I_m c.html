Yahoo list that I can't find?  Hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
I really don't like or "get" yahoo....and suspect you might be having <br/>
issues with uploading here.  Can't help you with that, really, other <br/>
than to admit my "issues."  If if it really is a .pdf file, try <br/>
uploading the the "pictures" section??<br/>
<br/>
I DO know that in some cases that unless one is a registered member of <br/>
this list one can't see all part of the group.  Do with that info what <br/>
you will and what your intentions are.<br/>
<br/>
I just LOVE AQ for pictures. You can upload eactly one, unless you've <br/>
photoshopped to combine images.  I love blogger even better for more <br/>
picture-heavy clues.<br/>
