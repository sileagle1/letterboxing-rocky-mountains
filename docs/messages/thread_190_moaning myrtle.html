The owner wants the box moved back to them, but via letterboxes.  So, it<br>
needs a note in it, asking to keep it moving towards CT.  If no one has<br>
moved it, I am going to try and head out to find this box this weekend<br>
and I will leave a note in it... <br>
 <br>
however, if you have it, can you please add a note before  placing it<br>
again.<br>
 <br>
Or, if you have put it in a new box, can you either let us all know<br>
where it is or go back and put a note in it?<br>
 <br>
Thank you!<br>
 <br>

I think I like the idea of putting a note on the hitch hiker to try to<br>
get it moving to Connecticut rather then mailing it. So if this location<br>
is close to you would you consider doing that?<br>
thank you<br>

The moaning myrtle hitchhiker was piked up from the "T-I-Double Guh-Er"<br>
Letterbox in Littleton,CO 4/18/04, and dropped of in the "Something<br>
Special for<br>
Eoghan!" letterbox in Littleton, CO 4/20/04<br>
