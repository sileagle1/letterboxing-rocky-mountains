What critters have YOU run into on the trails while boxing?<br>

fingers about an inch apart) close to stepping on a snake that had come<br>
out to sun itself on the trail.  Yikes!<br>

Also - the Plains Conservation Center boxes have a plethora of wildlife -<br>
prairie dog town, coyote, burrowing owls, and a really nice small herd of<br>
white tailed deer crossed my path on the way to one of the boxes there.<br>
<br>
And out in California - had an interesting encounter with a homeless<br>
person while boxing with California Bear.  Not an animal, really - he was<br>
quite nice!  :)<br>

I have been fortunate enough to see many critters while hiking<br>
outside of Texas, a lot of them in the Rocky Mt. area.  I have<br>
seen coyote, elk, moose, gizzly bear (in Alaska), black bear,<br>
polar bear (Canada), buffalo, pronghorn, mountain goats, <br>
big horn sheep, fox, marmot & pika.  <br>
The one critter I still have not seen is a mountain lion.<br>
Baby Bear and I once got chased out of our campsite by a black<br>
bear while backpacking in Minnesota, and a black bear once<br>
chased me away from my dinner at a campsite in California.<br>
Scared me so bad I laid awake most of the night in my tent!<br>
I envy all of you that live so close to such beauty & wildlife.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">While I've seen others, I'll say the ones I've seen while letterboxing since<br>
I began last spring.  (Another reason to love letterboxing, it allows you to<br>
get out and enjoy stuff like this!)<br>
<br>
On the LB trail I have seen the aforementioned bull moose as well as elk,<br>
coyote, bison, a rattlesnake (ooh, don't get me started on that one.  I saw<br>
it as I was just about to step on it!!  Luckily it was asleep or something<br>
because I moved quickly enough to avoid it and it didn't move), of course<br>
squirrels and chipmunks, marmuts, a variety of trout (in the same spot I<br>
have seen a salmon run before I discovered letterboxing, it's right by my<br>
Big Springs Series now), trumpeter swans, golden and bald eagles, osprey,<br>
peregrine falcons, blue herons, pelicans, canadian geese, and many dams from<br>
beavers.  The beavers themselves stayed hidden.<br>
<br>
Oh, and my friend's black lab puppy that we took along once for fun :-)  he<br>
made a great diversion while we sent others hunting for a box.<br>
<br>
Outside of LBing the other ones I've seen on the trail have been things like<br>
deer, a porcupine (that was a fun one), a grizzly bear and it's two cubs,<br>
antelope, oh, and I think about the whole of my family often counts as<br>
wildlife :-)<br>
<br>
Those are the main critters I can think of.   Dang, I love where I live!<br>
Isn't life near the mountains the best!  I don't think I could give that up.<br>
