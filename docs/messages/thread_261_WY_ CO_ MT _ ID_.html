   That sounds like a fun trip. I like all of the boxes in Grand <br>
Junction, but if I could only do one, and I had a couple of <br>
junior 'boxers along, I would choose Esmerelda's "Big Fish". Neat <br>
spot, awesome box, and quick to get to.<br>

We'll also be going through Jackson, and Cody. Looks like there are a <br>
WHOLE bunch in Wapiti, placed by elementary school kids. Does anyone <br>
have any info on those? Are they easy to get to, are the stamps cool, <br>
etc? <br>
<br>
A couple in Thermopolis - we're going to end up there as well.<br>
<br>
I don't see the boxes in Yellowstone either - but we all know how the <br>
park service feels about that...<br>
<br>
How about any just across the border in ID? Anyone know anything?<br>

  "Elk" and "Big Jackson Elk" (great stamp!!) in Jackson Hole are there.<br>
  We just planted 4 in the Tetons and Y S park so check for those.<br>
  Amanda's <br>
  "Old Faithful Inn" and Ryan's "Old Faithful Geyser" are good ones too.<br>
  The best <br>
  one of all is 26 miles off the main highway outside Big Timber, MT but<br>
  it's <br>
  SOOOOO worth it! The drive, the scenery, the stamp! Don't miss it.<br>
It's<br>
  by Don <br>
  and Gwen. The title is something river secret or the like.<br>

Look under "Ocre Rock" for YSNP. Also "Hiking Man", "Joe", "Oh, My Aching <br>

As for Idaho, I recommend anything by A-Bear or Mother Hen and Flock.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Funny that the boxes in Cody, WY should come up.  I just spent the <br>
weekend hunting for them and some others.  It was a fun trip.  I <br>
found most of the boxes.  I enjoyed the trip.  The box at the post <br>
office was missing (in Wapiti) I found the rest in the series up <br>
until one at a ranch.  I couldn't figure out quite what the clue was <br>
pointing to and the owner came out asking questions.  After that it <br>
was very dark and I still had to get into Yellowstone and find <br>
somewhere to sleep. I finally decided that it was too late and I <br>
reluctantly left the last few boxes in that series.<br>
<br>
I also planted two boxes while I was on my trip.  One between the <br>
national parks to still be okay with the rules, the other is outside <br>
of Island Park about 15 minutes or so outside of West Yellowstone.  <br>
The box between parks is one I carved up as a last minute whim while <br>
I was getting ready for sleep the night I stayed in Jackson before I <br>
went out in the morning.  The stamp outside of Island Park is one I <br>
carved quite a while ago, but I have been looking for a good spot <br>
along the Nez Perce trail.  It honors Chief Joseph.  I have to admit, <br>
I'm very proud of this stamp.  I purposely chose a spot along the <br>
trail that was close to Yellowstone so that visitors might still come <br>
hunt it down.  <br>
<br>
I also have a series planted right in Island Park.  They are some of <br>
the first letterboxes I ever planted.  Unfortunately Moose Droppings <br>
LB was dragged off by wildlife.  I'm sure the cabin box should still <br>
be fine.  I haven't heard how the third box is.  It was purposely <br>
hidden right off the trail so it could still be wheelchair <br>
accessible. I will be tickled if it is still there, but it was <br>
a "pretty gutsy hide" (according to Don and Gwen). <br>
<br>
The main boxes around Jackson and the parks are well documented on <br>
the LBNA site.  I believe all the ones that are currently on the site <br>
are active still.  <br>
<br>
By the way, I have been told by Amanda and Ryan that they prefer we <br>
not discuss (in a public forum like this) certain boxes they have <br>
planted that aren't on the LBNA site.  Just thought you might like to <br>
know.  There are rangers in NPS that have a vendetta against  them-<br>
just thought you might like to know.<br>
<br>
Let me know when you are coming and how far down you plan on <br>
visiting.  I still have a few boxes I hope to plant, but I'm not sure <br>
when I can.  Also let me know how far down you are coming.  I can <br>
give you info on all the boxes in Idaho Falls.  I also have a series <br>
there.  One of them is also missing and I plan to recarve it soon.  <br>
There was a recent report of the first box being below the water <br>
line, but I checked it and it isn't.  <br>
<br>
Okay, there was something else, but I forgot and it is the middle of <br>
the night.  If I remember, I will post it later.  I am beat, but I <br>
will try to post the clues tomorrow to my new boxes in the area you <br>
are visiting.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can deliver good news!  The east entrance was closed due to the <br>
landslide, but they have it all cleaned up now and they opened the <br>
entrance on Saturday-just hours before I went to find the <br>
letterboxes.  For once, timing was in my favor.  I thought I'd have <br>
to cancel my trip to Cody since I didn't have time to go by the <br>
northeast gate (faster than the south gate).<br>
<br>
If you go to Cody, a fun little thing is to go to the Irma hotel (the <br>
site of one of the letterboxes).  It's an old hotel built by Buffalo <br>
Bill Cody himself for his daughter.  I arrived there just a bit <br>
before their 6:00 "shootout."  It was cheesy, but still a fun little <br>
tourist trap.  The rodeos there are also good.  There's a lot of <br>
history in the area.<br>
<br>
I'm sad that I had to leave a few of the Cody boxes.  It was a <br>
pleasant afternoon looking for them.  Let me know if you find any of <br>
the others.  I'm especially sad to have missed one of Don and <br>
Gwen's.  It was getting dark, but I was going to brave it anyway when <br>
a forest service guy stopped me and sent me out (the camp is closed <br>
still).  I don't know where he was, but he was not happy with me <br>
trying to get past the sign to find something. (I didn't tell him I <br>
was looking for anything.)<br>
<br>
Oh, one tip: there was a lot of care put into the Wapiti boxes that <br>
are individual.  I didn't feel quite the same about the boxes that <br>
were in the long series.  I should have brought more bags.  Half of <br>
them weren't even bagged, most put a little snack bag in for the <br>
stamp, but left the log with no bag.  When you are looking for the <br>
ones in the series, take some clues like "first pullout in the <br>
highway" lightly.  The one that gave us the clue for the first <br>
pullout had a pullout immediately after it, two dirt roads and a few <br>
little spots here and there.  When you get to the right pullout, the <br>
rock with the crack won't be hard to spot.  It wouldn't surprise me <br>
if that was part of the reason I was the first finder on all of the <br>
series-people gave up.  There were also one or two spots that I was <br>
about to give up when I found that the areas in the clues were <br>
further apart than I had expected based on the other clues.  Really <br>
the clues are pretty easy to follow though.  You shouldn't have any <br>
problem.<br>
<br>
Well, once again, I am way past my bed time.  I better go to sleep <br>
before I start repeated half my phrases like I realize I did in the <br>
last email.  I really need to start making my posts and emails during <br>
the day.  I sometimes feel like a real ditz when I reread my sleepy <br>
posts :)<br>
<br>
till later,<br>
