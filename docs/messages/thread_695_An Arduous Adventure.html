                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's been two days since the final two in the fellowship finished <br>
their trek to the top of the Morgul Stair. It was no easy feat, since <br>
the fair elvish princess Aspenita needed help in the cooler morning <br>
hours down in the fair city near the Anduin River. That meant that the <br>
travelers must bear the midafternoon temperatures starting at 107* and <br>
the full waterskins they started with were soon emptied. Heat <br>
shimmered off the rocks as they took shelter under a large boulder <br>
that hid the first treasure of the day, Juggling the Rocks. After <br>
checking closely for orcs, the two continued up the stairs, stopping <br>
often as the sun beat down merciless. After taking twice the normal <br>
time to get up there, the two triumphed over the poisonous, evil <br>
Shelob, in her dark,webbed,lair. As they waved the fabulous journal in <br>
the air and danced from foot to foot, they noticed in the distance, <br>
the eagles were coming, the eagles were coming!<br>

Thanks for a fabulous adventure, Y!<br>
