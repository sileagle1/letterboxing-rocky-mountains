                    <div class="plaintext-content">I hadn't thought about the fact that many of you weren't letterboxing during<br>
the whole cheeseracing controversy.  That was a funny time on the big list.<br>
It was back when I thoroughly enjoyed the list still.  It was more of a<br>
community for me.  Don't get me wrong, we still had some doozies (sp?) of<br>
flame wars.  Anyway, you should search the list for cheeseracing.  It's<br>
fun.  I love the cheeseracing website.  I thought it was the funniest thing<br>
I'd seen in a while.<br>
<br>
I guess I didn't tell you about Texas ties.  I lived there for a year and a<br>
half (in the Houston area) while I did some work for my church.  I have an<br>
uncle who has been in the Dallas area for years, and two years ago my father<br>
moved out to the Dallas area as well.  When he did that, my grandparents<br>
decided it would be better to be close to two children as they were<br>
approaching their 90s so they also moved to Dallas.<br>
<br>
It's like there is this big Texas magnet pulling us.  I'm fighting it pretty<br>
hard though.  I enjoyed my time there, but I'm really not a TX gal.  I need<br>
mountains around me.  During that 1.5 years in Houston, I hadn't come home.<br>
I still remember flying back to SLC, and as we approached Colorado and I<br>
finally began to see mountains out of the plane window, I literally began to<br>
cry.  The person next to me must have thought I was losing it.  Who cries<br>
when they see mountains out of a plane window?  It just hit so hard that I<br>
finally knew I was coming home. :)<br>
<br>
So that's the Texas story.  If Silver Eagle still reads the list, I'm<br>
saluting in his direction.<br>
