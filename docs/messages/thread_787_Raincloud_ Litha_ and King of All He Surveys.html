                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi gang!  We replaced the log book for Raincloud this weekend for <br>
Funhog and both Litha and King of All He Surveys are in great shape!  <br>
Funhog, I need your mailing address to mail you a very full logbook!<br>
<br>
Me-lady, Es, looking forward to covertly stamping into Huzzah, <br>
huzzah!  Hopefully, we'll be successful and won't be dragged off to <br>
the dungeon before we get a chance to meet up with all you lords and <br>
lady's! If so, I will expect a pirate rescue! <br>
<br>
Hugs, Lady Peach and Sir Cappy<br>
<br>
P.S.  Jelybean, we are so jealous you got pie and cola...our day was <br>
not filled with such wonderful treats....we had only thunder and <br>
lightening!  But, next week, HUZZAH!<br>
