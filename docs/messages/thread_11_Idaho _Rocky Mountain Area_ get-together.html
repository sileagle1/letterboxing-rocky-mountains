list.  There will be a smallish gathering a week from tomorrow in <br/>
Idaho Falls.  <br/>
<br/>
I can't make it (- not enough notice) but thought some of you might <br/>
be interested!  <br/>

I hope I'm not taking liberties, but there are several LBers <br/>
traveling this direction next week.  We have decided to get together <br/>
on Saturday.  I am so excited to finally have a real exchange! (I'm <br/>
the only letterboxer in Eastern Idaho).  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, the thought occurred to me that there is always some small<br/>
possibility that some others may be interested in gathering with us.  <br/>
I know there are a couple of letterboxers connected to Norther UT and <br/>
CO, for instance.  So I'm posting this note to ask if anyone else <br/>
wishes to come. We will probably get together near Idaho Falls on <br/>
Saturday (which I believe is the 19th).  Feel free to contact me if <br/>
you wish to come.  I would love to see anyone from UT, MT, WY, ID, <br/>
CO, etc.-or for that matter, from anywhere!<br/>
We've talked about a possible cookout or eating out and hunting some <br/>
local boxes.  I'm going to go tonight and plant a new series just to <br/>
have it ready for Don, Gwen, and A-Bear's arrival.  I think I can get <br/>
Rock Climber to come too.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping to see anyone that can make it.  I can get camping/lodging <br/>
info for any that need it.<br/>
