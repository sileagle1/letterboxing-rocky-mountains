awesome spot......but getting kind of lonely. The last time it was <br>
found was in 2004...... by me. We were in the area anyway. I didn't <br>
hike all that way just to check on the letterbox.<br>
<br>
I should probably do something like that, though, to try to improve <br>
on my letterboxing karma. While I hear of you'all having your meet <br>
and greets and big hootenannies, and first plants found, and all that <br>
fun stuff.... I'm having to start over due to a little mix up in the <br>
friendly skies of United.<br>
<br>
My first mistake was checking a bag on my flight through Denver to <br>
Salt Lake City. I haven't seen that bag now for two weeks, and the <br>
first week was living in a hotel, borrowing my neice's husband's <br>
clothes, and doing laundry in the sink. But, hey, I can get over <br>
losing a few clothes....what really hurts is that I had my super-<br>
sweet leather bound journal that I bought at the faire in Larkspur. I <br>
haven't really been letterboxing much since then, except for A <br>
CERTAIN HALLOWEEN GATHERING IN SANTA FE!!!! Ouch! There is some <br>
consolation in the fact that Elros and La Paloma have copies of the <br>
stamps I found that day....but the exchanges I made there were long-<br>
awaited and personal. I can't believe I checked a bag with that in <br>
there!......and hope is pretty slim that it will ever be found. <br>
<br>
I also lost my signature stamp but it was time for a new one of those <br>
anyway.<br>
<br>
So...All you folks that were at the Spooktacular.....I'll be needing <br>
to meet up again for an exchange if I can get my karma running.<br>

So sorry to hear that you lost your beautiful logbook. We've been <br>
talking about a Durango trip this summer, now we have even more reason <br>
to come out your way.<br>
<br>
Boxing karma has been excellent on this side of the divide, and you're <br>
always welcome to come to our gatherings ;-)<br>
<br>
FRH<br>

You were in SLC?!!  With nary a shout in this direction?!!  SHAME SHAME<br>
SHAME!<br>
<br>
OK, your pain is severe enough with the loss (maybe - there is always<br>
hope!) of that beautiful journal.  So you are forgiven just this once. <br>
Next time though, please let us know you are coming and we'll have a<br>
mini-/boxing meet.<br>
<br>
Wishing you improved karma really soon, Boxer Lover<br>

And believe me, I would love to get in on some of those Front Range <br>

<br>
Boxer Lover- I had every intention of hunting down a few boxes and <br>
dropping you a line while I was there. The thing is that my niece was <br>
my only transportation and she is a little...more like A <br>
LOT...stubborn. I can't really complain because my agenda was mostly <br>
about sampling the fine Asian restaurants in Salt Lake City and gawking <br>
at architecture. The fact that I didn't have my logbook pretty much <br>
sealed my fate. But I whined enough that she knows I'll be doing some <br>
letterboxing related stuff next time I'm in town. Hopefully then I'll <br>
have more than just the evenings free. The surrounding areas (Wasatch <br>
in particular) were calling me to explore pretty loudly....<br>

We get SO excited when someone comes to call. There are now 4 very <br>
active boxers in SLC and me in Ogden. We know of a few lurkers, too, <br>
that we are hoping to flush out for our mini-meet when SHH and Triple <br>
T travel through on their way to Moab in May.<br>
<br>
Also, on a positive note, we will await anxiously your post that your <br>
luggage and logbook have safely resurfaced WHEN (not if) that happens.<br>

I still have all the Moab stamps because they were in an older <br>
logbook.(Yay!)<br>
But there are quite a few that have been added around Moab and Indian <br>
Creek since I've been there. (Which has been wayyyyy too <br>
long....what's up with that?) All I can say is that a couple of days <br>
in Dark Canyon left me with a craving for more Boxing on the Rocks. <br>
I've just gotta make it happen.<br>
