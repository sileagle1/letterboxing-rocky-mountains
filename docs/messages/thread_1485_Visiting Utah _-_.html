Oh, oh, oh!!!!! We're coming up there soon!!! TX AF Family will be <br>
spending a week in Eden, Utah, the second week of June!! We can't wait <br>
to hit boxes in the area and meet anyone who is willing :-) BTW, do <br>
they have have pie over there?<br>
TX AF Family<br>
<br>
P.S. We will also be spending a few days in the Yellowstone area before <br>
the Utah trip. Any suggestions on not-to-miss boxes near Jackson Hole, <br>
WY?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Second week in June is looking good for me at this point. As for pie, <br>
I'm not much of a cook, but there's a Village Inn close by. Might be <br>
a good place for an exchange! Maybe we can entice some of the SLC <br>
boxers to join us.<br>
<br>
I'll take a look at LBs around Jackson and get back to you <br>
privately. Any of you other RML boxers got any recommendations?<br>
