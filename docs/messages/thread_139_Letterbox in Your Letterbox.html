<br/>
The Letterbox in Your Letterbox was mailed to me by Jay and Kendra in <br/>
Kansas on my birthday. :)  After a short sojourn in Utah it is on it's <br/>
way again and should arrive at it's next stop in time for Christmas.  The <br/>
box is in fabulous shape and is a very beautiful surprise for all who <br/>
recieve it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for creating a wonderful box!<br/>
