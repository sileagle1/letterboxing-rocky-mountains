A First Finder certificate is basically just a "prize" that would go to the first finder of your box.  FF items can range from a special image of the stamp - to a little paper certificate that you might design on your computer to "congratulate" the first person to find the box.  It is a special treat to add to your log book.  I found one box that had a little ziplock back with an old coin inside (the coin is now in my logbook) ...<br/>
<br/>
It's not necessary to include a FF prize or certificate, but it certainly is spiffy to find one.<br/>

  Hi All,<br/>
  Just curious, what is a first finder certificate?  I know it sounds self explanitory, but I am getting ready to plant a few boxes and this is the first that I have heard about this.  I want to make sure that I do it right.<br/>
  Thanks<br/>
