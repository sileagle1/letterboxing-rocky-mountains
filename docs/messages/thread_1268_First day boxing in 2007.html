and headed out to find a few letterboxes.  We ended up at your boxes <br>
in Thompson Springs, PRE!<br>
<br>
The weather was just to die for... perfect temperature, the sky was <br>
clear and blue and it made us feel all springish and goofy.<br>
<br>
We really had a wonderful time.  The boxes are both really well <br>
thought out and very interesting plants.. I highly recommend them to <br>
anyone who wll be in the area. We only saw one other living soul the <br>
entire time, someone driving on through.  It was easy to feel like we <br>
had gone back in time as we marveled at the rock art and wandered <br>
around the ghost town.  <br>
<br>
I'm on my laptop right now but tomorrow when I get onto my regular <br>
computer I'll see if any of the picturs we took can be shared without <br>
giving anything away.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for the special day, PRE!<br>
<br>
Es, happy to have two new stamps in her journal to start off the new <br>
year<br>

I tell ya'll what!  I've been around JUST long enough in the Planting <br>
Of Boxes World to now completely apPREciate this post.<br>
<br>
I've had a Poopy Week from Hell (ok...if someone knows from whence <br>
such weeks originate ...other than Hell.....lemme know okie dokey...)?<br>
<br>
Putting your "stuff" - your creativity - your HOPE that someone will <br>
just Want to Find Your Box...comes later...much, much later..in <br>
unexpected, week-lifting ways....when you LEAST expect them.<br>
<br>
Like in pooper scooper weeks, or on completely snowbound days (when <br>
you can't even open your front door, much less contemplate <br>
driving/boxing/etal...<br>
<br>
For posts like this one (thanks Es!) and/or status updates: I am <br>
thankful! and looking forward to pictures!<br>

<br>
 I followed my directions: Park by the National Forest sign 13 miles <br>
north of Durango, it's by mile marker 38. Head northwest and wiggle <br>
through fence onto Forest Service Land. Follow path down hill about a <br>
150 yards until you can bear left and go over a rise into an old <br>
quarry.<br>
<br>
"What are ye looking for?" the old Scotsman asked<br>
<br>
"I hear there is a cave around here that's fun to explore. I also <br>
heard you have to be careful because of the bad air in there."<br>
<br>
"Bad air? Enchantment is closer to the truth. When you go into that <br>
cove you're tresspassin' on a draigon. Some folks go in an' don't <br>
come back out!"<br>
<br>
"A dragon! Now I've GOT to go in there!"<br>
<br>
Then the old Scot looked me up and down and said, "You'd better stick <br>
to the wee one next door..<br>
<br>
Leuk endways `neath the yellae heuch,<br>

And daunder tae the cove.<br>

out what he was saying.)<br>
