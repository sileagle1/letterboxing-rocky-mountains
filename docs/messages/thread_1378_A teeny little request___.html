<br>
When you make minor changes to your clues, can you please make a note <br>
at the top that the clues have been changed as of such-and-such a date?<br>
<br>
Let me explain my reasoning:  The H-A's just returned from our first <br>
trip to Moab.  We started printing out clues way back when so we could <br>
get a jump on where the boxes were and which ones could be done <br>
together, etc.  After months of planning, we had about as much figured <br>
out as we could remotely.  Right before we left, we took a look online <br>
at all of the clues we had printed out to see if any were noted as <br>
changed or missing.  We adjusted our plans as required and printed out <br>
the clues that had changed.  HOWEVER, it would have taken forever to <br>
try to figure out if each individual box's clues had changed without <br>
it being noted, so we assumed that any clue not noted hadn't changed.  <br>
Unfortunately, in at least one case, we realized after we returned <br>
that the clue had been updated, which was why we never found the box.<br>
<br>
If it sounds like my post has "a tone," it isn't meant to.  As I said, <br>
it is just a teeny little request and I welcome other's viewpoints on <br>
it.<br>
<br>
Also, if you have boxes in Moab and you haven't heard an update from <br>
me, it is just because I haven't gotten to updating everyone yet.  We <br>
found many, many boxes while we were there when we weren't distracted <br>
by the amazing scenery.  Hopefully we were the last ones who'd never <br>
been to Moab, but if there are any more of you, by all means get out <br>
there!<br>

great if people updated the clue when they make changes.  I usually put <br>
xx/xx/xx UPDATE ... right at the top of my clues in LBNA.<br>
<br>
I've been using Atlas Quest more for clues now than LBNA.  If a clue <br>
has been updated since it was listed, you'll see the plant date, date <br>
the clue was last updated, and the date it was last found.  I find this <br>
very helpful.<br>
