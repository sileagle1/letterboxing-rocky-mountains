                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey kids,<br>
<br>
I had an idea for a new kind of letterbox, but wanted to get your <br>
thoughts on it first.  It is sort of a traveling bonus or parasite <br>
box but works in reverse; you find the parasite first and it tells <br>
you how to find the original.  I am tentatively calling it a <br>
Changeling Box, and here's the idea:<br>
<br>
1) You get the clues for some normal box like usual and head out to <br>
find it.<br>
2) Upon arriving at the spot where you think it should be, you <br>
instead find another box, an imposter, a Changeling.<br>
3) You stamp into the Changeling like you would a normal box.  On the <br>
most recent entry in the logbook, you find the directions to find the <br>
original box, hidden somewhere nearby.<br>
4) You find the original box nearby and stamp into it like normal.<br>
5) You take the original box back to its original spot and re-hide it <br>
where it was supposed to be.  You take the Changeling with you when <br>
you leave.<br>
6) Next time you go out to find a letterbox, you take the Changeling <br>
with you, and when you find the box you set out for, you temporarily <br>
remove it an put the Changeling in its place.<br>
7) You look for a suitable hiding spot nearby to hide the original <br>
box.<br>
8) You put the directions to find the original box as the newest <br>
entry in the Changeling log, rehide everything and be on your way.<br>
<br>
What do you think, is this fun or offensive?  Would you object to <br>
having someone temporarily remove one of your boxes?  If you hate the <br>
idea, don't be afraid to say so, I can take criticism.<br>

But I'd worry about weekend or casual boxers messing it up.  I don't <br>

seem to be in a hurry or may not understand it kind of way.  You'd <br>
want whoever was rehiding the original box to be diligent about <br>
rehiding it well.. not just tossing it behind the nearest tree and <br>
scooping leaves over it.  <br>
<br>
Maybe if it was only on certain boxes?  Maybe special harder to find <br>
ones? <br>
<br>
 What's that bird that pushes the chicks from other birds out of the <br>

I'd NEVER do anything to someone else's box without their prior approval <br>
(minus replacing a ziploc or so).  A while back there was a brief lived <br>
thing I believe was a virus which was basicly the same thing which involved <br>
relocating boxes, even a short distance and there was a huge uproar about <br>
it.  I believe no one should have the right to change the experience set out <br>
by those who place the box, minus the standard additions of logs into books <br>
or HHs and so on.<br>
<br>
I think it is a bad idea to encourage anything but proper re-hideation.  <br>
Encouraging moving boxes is BAD.  Folks set up boxes in specific places with <br>
specific clues.  If folks begin re-hiding boxes where THEY desire, then it <br>
is not the same experience as what the planter intended.  Plus those who <br>
relocate might put them in compromising locations.  Plus if a channgling <br>
goes missing the origional box goes missing as well.<br>
<br>
People place these boxes out of good-will and shouldn't have the additional <br>
worry of this business.<br>

  More boxes for your time and effort!  However, the fear of getting one of our own boxes replaced is legitimate.  You'd have to trust people to do things correctly (and with no ill intentions).  But don't we already do that?  Putting a box out at all is a risk.  We put a little plastic box on the ground in the middle of nowhere, left to the wild and elements; then we put information on the internet that ANYone can access describing how to find it.  Anyone who's placed a box knows there's always risk involved.  And how many hitchhikers have we let loose into the world?  Little bitty boxes that we've put so much work and love into with the expectation that letterboxers will take good care of them?  I'm not necessarily saying we've GOT to do Changelings (though I'd want to find one!), but I do feel like we all ought to give it some thought before jumping to a NO-WAY conclusion.<br>
   <br>
  Imagine what we'd be missing out on if traditional letterboxing was the only accepted form?  No virtuals, postals, cooties, personal travelers, hitchhikers, etc.  This idea could lead us to experience yet another world of delight!  <br>

     A new kind of box - fun or offensive?   Posted by: "jelybean_lb" jelybean@adelphia.net   jelybean_lb   Sat Jul 28, 2007 12:27 pm (PST)   Hey kids,<br>
<br>
I had an idea for a new kind of letterbox, but wanted to get your <br>
thoughts on it first. It is sort of a traveling bonus or parasite <br>
box but works in reverse; you find the parasite first and it tells <br>
you how to find the original. I am tentatively calling it a <br>
Changeling Box, and here's the idea:<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, thanks to everyone who responded to this idea, either here or <br>
offline, either positively or negatively.  I've gotten a lot of good <br>
thoughts from you.  After some consideration, I've decided to drop the <br>
idea.<br>
<br>
I've been letterboxing almost since the historic Smithsonian article <br>
was published and I have to say, there was a time when this idea may <br>
have found a better reception.  Seems like some years ago (almost ten <br>
now!) letterboxers seemed more respectful of other people's boxes.  But <br>
the hobby has expanded rapidly to today, and there are some good things <br>
about that, and some not so good things.  When I see a private, word-of-<br>
mouth box being trashed - and one that obviously involved a tremendous <br>
amount of time, effort (and money) - that pretty much tells me I can no <br>
longer rely on people to respectfully move a box, and respectfully put <br>
it back.  If even special WOM boxes are not being treated well, then <br>
this idea probably won't fly.  So, not wanting to jeopardize anyone <br>
else's boxes, I've decided not to pursue this.  I'll keep searching for <br>
other ways to make this hobby more and more fun.<br>
