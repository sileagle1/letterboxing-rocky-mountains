To honor the enthusiasm of all my friends I replanted 4 boxes today in Boise (yes, I braved the 90- degree heat as a true labor of love).  I also checked on two boxes this weekend while I was out and about.  Clues for these 6 boxes are on AQ with an F-5 restriction.<br>

Checked and Alive and Well:<br>

Re-Plant:<br>
<br>
Visions of Angels (2 boxes) Boise, Idaho<br>
<br>
Original stamps re-planted.  Boxes moved from Horseshoe Bend to Boise.  First finders re-plant gifts included in both boxes.  Replant gifts do not have anything to do with the actual boxes.  Just a little something from me to make the find extra fun.<br>

<br>
Golf Course Fishing-Boise/Eagle, Idaho<br>
<br>
I have combined two separate plants into one series of two boxes.  This series contains the original carvings of both "Easy Catch" and "No Fishing."  Both boxes are now located on the trail that "Easy Catch" lived on alone before it was vandalized.  One re-plant gift has nothing to do with the box it is in and the other has everything to do with the box.<br>

<br>
It's ultra-important to watch for updates on the AQ Boards as I am moving boxes around, changing box names etc. So you don't end up re-visiting old finds (unless you intend to).  In the case of "No Fishing" I am leaving the original posting as retired so I do not mess up find counts for anyone who originally found the box.<br>

Happy hunting and watch those mosquitos.  Even with heavy duty spray I came back with three bites this weekend.  Those darn mosquitos just love me.  And I think tick season is in full swing now.  Although Raisin and Jay are protected from fleas and ticks the humans in our family are not.  I would swear a few attempted to come home on my pant legs and shoes.  Mr. Blackvelvetrav said they were small spiders and not ticks but I completely disagree. Mosquitos and ticks oh my! <br>
