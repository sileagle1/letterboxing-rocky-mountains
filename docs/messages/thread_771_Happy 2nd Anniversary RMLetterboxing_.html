                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Autumn!  Happy Anniversary to our RMLetterboxing group "founding <br/>
mother"!  I too, can't believe how this group has grown.  Thanks for <br/>
organizing it those many moons ago!  I still remember that cake you <br/>
brought to Roxborough to celebrate.  YUM! Cake, Pie, any dessert is <br/>
just plain yummy! Are you able to make it to the RenFair? <br/>
<br/>
Welcome, Kris!  Congrats on your first adventure in boxing!  Our <br/>
first was at Roxborough in 2002 and we saw a mother and baby bear in <br/>
a tree!  Seems like the 1st boxes are memorable ones!  We love this <br/>
addiction, errr...I mean hobby!  We live in Ken-Caryl Valley, behind <br/>
the hogback and just North of Deer Creek where you were boxing.  <br/>
Hope you can make it to the gathering on the 24th...for pie, of <br/>
course!<br/>
<br/>
Hugs, Dixie Peach<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What fun to remember! I can't believe it was two years ago that I joined <br/>
this crazy bunch. I remember thinking that I probably wouldn't really have a <br/>
place here since you were all in Colorado, but I decided to come to the <br/>
group since I am in the Rockies region and it was the closest I could come <br/>
to having a regional group with only a few boxers in my state. I knew most <br/>
of the focus of the group would be there, but look how we've grown. I know <br/>
most of the focus is still in Colorado, but I still love reading your posts <br/>
and sharing with you. It only took a moment of watching in Moab to know that <br/>
we have been a group of friends and it didn't matter where we were. I'm so <br/>
glad to be associated with you scurvy pirate pie lovers! You are a fine <br/>
bunch. Thanks for being my LB friend over these last couple of years.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yep, this group sure has seen a lot of fun letterboxing in two years. <br/>
And the Moab gathering was a good example of how widespread, but <br/>
tightly knit it is.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of the Anniversary makes me think back to when I joined. The <br/>
kindness and help that I recieved was just phenomenal. Unlike our <br/>
newbie Kris, I hunted for an obscure letterbox near me for about a <br/>
month without any luck. If I wasn't having so much fun reading the <br/>
posts here, I don't think I would have kept at it. The kindness I <br/>
felt from Silver Eagle, Autumn, Cadenza, and also from Jay Drew <br/>
really shaped the way I participate in letterboxing. And in the years <br/>
since, I have formed some friendships in this group that have become <br/>
the real reward of this pastime. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Autumn, and happy Anniversary.<br/>
