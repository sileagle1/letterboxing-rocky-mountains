when BoxerLover looked?  There is that campground across the road-ish <br>
and it's not like that box gets tons of traffic.  Maybe someone <br>
thought they could hang on to it, take it back to the campsite for a <br>
bit, and all?<br>
<br>
<fingers crossed for Es><br>
<br>
Remembering it was one of the first boxes I looked for last year <br>
during BMAO/Fools Day....stamping in while sitting on a rock on the <br>
other side of the bridge with my cuppa coffee, watching the water and <br>
the sun come up ...all Giddy ...UpLifted ....with just how life great <br>
can be once in awhile, especially with such awesome treats to be found <br>
when us non-morning-peoples decide to "do a morning."  This box just <br>
cannot be missing!  I will it NOT to be so, dag nab it!<br>

How in the world did anyone find that by accident?  I don't even <br>

Thanks for the update!  Hope you had a wonderful time!<br>
