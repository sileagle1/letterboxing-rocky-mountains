I just looked in my pack and guess what....the log book is in there.  Ill put it back tomorrow am if I can get in the park real early (I have to be up in Arvada at 730am).  Ill go there first thing. Im real sorry...my first find and I screw it up.  Guess I was so excited about stamping that I got carried away.<br>
Wont make that mistake again.<br>
<br>
Thanks for organizing the gathering...it was great meeting all of you.  Lets do it again.<br>
