                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tonight we replanted two of my formerly vandalized boxes.  Both "Angel on My Shoulder" and "In My Prayers" are now resting at Dry Creek Cemetery in Boise.  In my Prayers was originally planted in Meridian but is now in Boise.  In addition to re-planning the original stamps I was able to retool the defaced logbooks by removing the front and back covers and replacing them with new ones.  In essence it is almost as if both of these boxes were never vandalized in the first place.  I did leave behind a small re-planting gift with both boxes.  However, neither gift has anything to do with the box it is planted with.  Just a little something for the next finder to keep.<br/>
