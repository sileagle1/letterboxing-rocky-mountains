                    <div class="plaintext-content">Before I get to my question, I just wanted to also add my sorrow about<br>
hearing about the careless treatment that the Pirate King has gotten!<br>
It was such a beautiful box with all its lovely contents. I truly<br>
hated to hear that it was damaged. At least most of the contents are<br>
intact, but I agree that the journal is the most important part! I<br>
hope that the rest of the series is ok, as I have only completed the<br>
first 2 boxes! A  pox on those who were so careless!! <br>
<br>
I also hate to hear about others' journals being mistreated, and I<br>
wholeheartedly agree that great care should be taken when stamping<br>
in!! I personally never let my kids mess with journals for fear that<br>
they would even just mess up our stamp in it! :)<br>
<br>
So now on to my question... I was wondering what everyone's carving<br>
tool(s) of choice is/are. I am looking for something for fine lines in<br>
particular. I had bought a Speedball set awhile back that came with a<br>
handle and 5 blades, but I find that the #1 is still too big, and is<br>
not nearly sharp enough! It seems to tear rather than cut. I find<br>
myself going back to my faithful Xacto knife for all cutting/carving.<br>
But, I still would like to find something better for those detail<br>
areas. The knife cuts too deep sometimes and can weaken my lines. I<br>
have read about using a hollow needle, like vets use on horses & such,<br>
but I don't know where to get one. Any ideas from anyone?<br>
<br>
Thanks-<br>
claudey<br>
<br>
PS-I finished my carving of Gandalf the Grey last night!! Now I just<br>
need to make a journal & he'll be on his way! :)<br>

O love, love, LOVE my MasterCarve tools.  I use the itty bitty one pretty much all the time.  <br>
   <br>
  Also, I find that putting my stamp in the freezer for a bit to harden up before I try for tiny details really helps.  ...but watch out!  It also makes it more likely that the blade will jump and dive into your finger.  OUCH!  <br>

<br>
I took a few of the number 1 nibs, put them on the stove until they <br>
were uber hot, then squished them with pliers to make them smaller.  <br>
I also use a diamond sharpening stone which keeps them reeeeally <br>
sharp.  They go through the Mastercarve like buttah.  The stone is <br>
way easy to use... got it at a sporting goods store for a few <br>
dollars. <br>
