I found Butterfly Trail not long ago - mid-late June.  If you (or the <br>
placer) want to contact me offlist, I can tell you the particulars.  We <br>
found that one clue was not there, and the box was not where I expected it <br>
to be, once we found the correct location.<br>
<br>
Also - I like your idea of a missing box list.  A twist on the idea - you <br>
could create a "database" right here on the RML message board - list the box <br>
name, date reported missing, status from the placer, etc.  Would be easy to <br>
maintain.  I can help get it set up if you like.    Would need strict rules <br>
on "no spoilers" for the box, and we would NOT have the status of boxes that <br>
are "alive and well" - so hopefully this will discourage folks from the <br>
types of databases that have been problematic in the past.  Just a simple <br>
list of which boxes are down for maintenance, missing, or potentially <br>
missing and placer contacted.<br>
<br>
If there's much discussion about this, I can create a poll to get votes from <br>
the group?<br>

Ramdelt that there isn't anything worse than traveling to find a <br>
letterbox and it's gone missing.  Of course, the boxer could be <br>
misreading the clues and it isn't missing at all.  BUT, it really <br>
could be missing!  If Ramdelt is willing to take on the project, <br>
then I vote for it!  I would love to have a place to double check <br>
before I walk out the door!  Maybe it could have a spreadsheet look <br>
that tells you if:  a.  the box has been taken out by placer for <br>
service, b.  one boxer reported it missing, look for it at your own <br>
risk  c.  It's MISSING...verified by placer, and or several boxers!  <br>
I know this could get crazy, but if there is permission given by the <br>
placer, I don't see the problem.  In fact, it would help many <br>
boxers!  I've sworn off letterboxing under my breath on more than <br>
one occasion because of the disheartening feeling when a box is gone <br>
and I feel I wasted time that could have been spent looking for <br>
another box that IS there!  Placers have to be RESPONSIBLE to either <br>
be able to check on the status of their own box or have a contact to <br>
do it for them.  If they aren't willing to do that, then why should <br>
boxers take up their time to look for a box that is missing!  A <br>
reference list is a GREAT idea Ramdelt!  I personally would be so <br>
appreciative.  <br>

Autumn, I think a poll is a GREAT idea!<br>
