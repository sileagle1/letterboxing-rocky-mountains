       I just use a straight exacto blade, but I replace it every <br>
third stamp or so and I can tell the difference. They are a lot <br>
cheaper than carving tool blade sets. For a carving tool I wouldn't <br>
change it as often, but I would change it if I noticed tearing. Can <br>
you just buy one nib? The stores around me only sell sets.<br>

I've seen just blades or sets of two or three of the same blade at <br>
Hobby Lobby in Englewood. <br>
