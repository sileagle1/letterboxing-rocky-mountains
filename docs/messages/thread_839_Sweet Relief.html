letterboxes is  missing?  How sweet is it when you go to check and <br/>
find that it is right where it is supposed to be?  Whew!  Got a report <br/>
that Enginerd was missing from the gnarly old tree, but went to check <br/>
last night and found it safe and sound.<br/>

If you happen across a copy of Cooking Light magazine, not only is <br/>
there an article about the Denver area, but there is a letter about <br/>
letterboxing.  Why articles about Denver and letters about <br/>
letterboxing in a cooking magazine?  Well, after subscribing I have <br/>
determined that the title should be changed to Light ON Cooking <br/>
magazine...<br/>
