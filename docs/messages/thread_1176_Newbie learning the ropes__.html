Hi!!!!!!  Just a quick post to introduce myself &amp; to say hello to<br/>
everyone here!  I'm brand new to letterboxing &amp; so far just LOVE it!<br/>
I learned about his hobby through my sister who lives in Wyoming. <br/>
(Still fairly uncharted territory, near as I can tell!)<br/>
<br/>
I have spent the past couple of weeks reading up on whatever I can.  We<br/>
have also gone out hunting a few times and have located 13 boxes &amp; even<br/>
a HH!  We are hooked!  We are even going to try our luck at carving this<br/>
weekend (I'm very nervous!) &amp; have been brainstorming ideas for<br/>
boxes we can plant!  Any information you can send my way on the<br/>
etiquette/rules around box planting and/or stamp carving would be much<br/>
appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Let's see, I am located in Thornton, CO &amp; was introduced to this<br/>
group by preboxed  [:)]  (Thank You!!!).  After combing through the past<br/>
threads I have to say, I am so impressed with the knowledge on this site<br/>
-- and everyone appears to be very friendly, too!  Hats off to this<br/>
group of people, I know I will learn a ton from you all.  I am bummed<br/>
that we just missed the Grand Lake Gathering  looks like we missed<br/>
a great time!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just wanted to pop my head in and say hi! I look forward to<br/>
joining in some good conversation  and learning a lot from the<br/>
pros!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
PolarisTrekker (Nikki Gast)<br/>
