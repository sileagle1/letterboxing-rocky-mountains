Arrr....Stubby be the coolest pirate around, now!  I'm not sure <br/>
exactly what happened since I've only been following the notes on <br/>
here, but it sounds like a wound suffered in a deadly and exciting sea <br/>
battle with brigands and lots of treasure and now, doesn't matter if <br/>
he wants to be or not, he's an official high ranking pirate guy with <br/>
fringe and lace and a really cool hat on board the sweetest pirate <br/>
ship afloat.. HAR!  <br/>
