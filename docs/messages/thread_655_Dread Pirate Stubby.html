Arrr....Stubby be the coolest pirate around, now!  I'm not sure <br>
exactly what happened since I've only been following the notes on <br>
here, but it sounds like a wound suffered in a deadly and exciting sea <br>
battle with brigands and lots of treasure and now, doesn't matter if <br>
he wants to be or not, he's an official high ranking pirate guy with <br>
fringe and lace and a really cool hat on board the sweetest pirate <br>
ship afloat.. HAR!  <br>

Stubby the Toothslayer only lost about 3/8 of an inch on his finger and the rest seems to be healing up nicely.  He has a very short "funky" looking nail but at least he didn't lose the whole thing!  I also want to report that he seems to be hooked on letterboxing and has been out with one of his daughters who is also enjoying the hunt.<br>

tickled to know the letterboxing bug has bit. Once it does you are never the <br>
