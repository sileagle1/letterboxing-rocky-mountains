                    <div class="plaintext-content">I sadly need to report that Alpine Pal appears to be missing just <br>
weeks after Blackvelvet's sister planted it.  It was a beautiful day <br>
today, so Cappy and I decided to do some boxing.  This one is not <br>
too far from us.  We were so disappointed because we know we found <br>
the stack of rocks where it was hidden, it matched the clues to a <br>
tee and the rocks were too stacked to be coincidental.  It's a <br>
heavily used trail and we wondered if somebody spotted it and took <br>
it.  We searched all around and even looked for possible people that <br>
may be boxers that were stamping in, but no luck.  So, until it can <br>
be confirmed by Blackvelvet's sister that it is indeed missing, I <br>
want to caution anyone else from making the trek.  And, it is a bit <br>
of trek uphill.  We were glad we brought our hiking sticks...steep <br>
and alot of loose rocks to negotiate.  <br>
<br>
Blackvelvet, let me know what your sister says!<br>
<br>
Hope you all had a Happy Holiday!  It's been beautiful here....this <br>
is why I will never move from gorgeous state!<br>
<br>
Wish you all a wonderful New Year full of memorable boxing!<br>
<br>
Hugs around!  Dixie Peach and Cappy<br>
