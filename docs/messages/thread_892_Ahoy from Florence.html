This lasagna is like none other I've ever had.  Oy.  <br/>

And.. my first gelato today.  Is this a great country or what?!<br/>

Ah well, its not like I was 'really' dieting, just trying to watch <br/>
what I eat. Did you know that, unless you look in a mirror while you <br/>
eat, that you can't see the food go into your mouth? ...guess that's <br/>
what eyeteeth are for.... <br/>

Much love to all!<br/>
