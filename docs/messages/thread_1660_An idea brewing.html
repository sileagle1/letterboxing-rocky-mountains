                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey all ...<br>
I know that AQ has an annual "plant a letterbox day", but I thought it might<br>
be fun to set up an event for the Rocky Mtn gang - Plant a Box MONTH.  There<br>
are some of our wonderful local area boxers who plant like a VILLION boxes,<br>
and I thought this might be a fun way to encourage others to plant one (or a<br>
few?) so that later this spring and summer we would all have a variety of<br>
new boxes to find!   Of course, you'd be able to plant as many as your heart<br>
desires, or just get out there and do some maintenance to reactivate old<br>
boxes, etc. etc.<br>
<br>
I know ... I know ... we shouldn't need an event to encourage us to plant.<br>
Actually, I dont believe we do.  In fact, I know boxers who have 10+ boxes<br>
sitting at home waiting for the perfect sunny unencumbered weekend to go on<br>
a planting spree!  I just thought it would be a fun thing, and perhaps some<br>
of us (ahem ... that'd be me) might be encouraged to get carving and get out<br>
on the trails sooner and get some of their creations hidden.  Personally, I<br>
tend to go in wild spurts.  I planted a bunch in 2003, then I was a bonehead<br>
for a few years and either didn't box at all (gasp!) or boxed a little but<br>
didn't plant.  I admit, sometimes I need a little encouragement, so this is<br>
as much to encourage myself as others.<br>
<br>
Any thoughts?   I thought I would shoot for March or April (march tends to<br>
be a very snowy month).<br>
