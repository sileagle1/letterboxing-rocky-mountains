my best girlfriends, who sadly, moved to NM and I never visit (she <br>
claims). <br>
<br>
Anyway - I got her hooked on the idea of boxing, and I'm going to go <br>
down for the Balloon Fiesta and a long weekend of boxing in early <br>
October!<br>
<br>
I can't wait!  I spent a good few hours pouring over the clues for <br>
Santa Fe, Albuquerque and surrounding areas.  <br>
