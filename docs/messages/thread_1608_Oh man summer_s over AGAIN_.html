Ball! (2008) box for the season, as it *only* available for 2 weeks <br/>
on each side of the Rockies first and last home games.<br/>
<br/>
If you want this year's stamp - please do so before sunset on Sunday, <br/>
10/19 or you'll have to wait for next year...when this box will have <br/>
a brand new stamp and book.  <br/>
<br/>
I update the same listing each year (rather than create a new one), <br/>
so if you have this as an online logged find already it's off your <br/>
radar screen....just so you know.<br/>
<br/>
This year's logbook is just about full and the box has a magnet <br/>
that's become detached, just so you know, but otherwise box is fine <br/>
and dandy...at least as of 2 weeks ago when I went to a game.<br/>
