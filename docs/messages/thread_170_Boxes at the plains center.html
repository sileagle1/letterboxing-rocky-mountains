It was a bit orchestrated, and the boxes were not difficult, but it was educational, and the prairie was nice.  I was happy to be the first "non-staff" letterboxer to do them all.  I saw a small herd of white tails, some burrowing owls, and things.  The hardest one was the Sod Village, I thought - and the longest "walk" was the Coyote Canter.   ..<br/>
There is NO SHADE at all - so don't wait for the middle of summer to do this.  I did it right after the fourth of July last year, and was burnt to a crispy critter!  :)  <br/>
<br/>
You might check to see if they're planning a free day, or find a day when they're doing some other interesting event, so your $5 goes a bit further.<br/>

Oh ... and I ALWAYS feel the thrill of "I found one" ... so this was no exception.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Are there any opinions about the boxes at the plains center in Aurora (Tipi Treck, Sod Village Pioneer Trek, Coyote Cantor).  I was just curious as to whether they held the same joy of 'I found one! or did it feel more orchestrated, and possibly just an attempt to get people in there?(with the $5 charge).<br/>
