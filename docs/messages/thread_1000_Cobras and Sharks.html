                    <div class="plaintext-content">These are all great and it helps me a lot to hear other ideas. My <br>
brain gets stuck on one thing and I get blinded to other possibilities.<br>
<br>
You're gonna kill me, though. During the recap last night I realized <br>
that the clue was "Bayfield Zip PLUS 1679" which leaves 82801. Sorry, <br>
I was writing so fast I forgot the math.<br>
<br>
Other new clues:<br>
<br>
5. The Frosty Difference (from before)<br>
<br>
12. You won't find it at the snowshoe shuffle.<br>
<br>
15. It's like Tiger in the woods.<br>
<br>
16. No Motorcycles, No Parking, No Camping.<br>
<br>
Okay, those signs are on the gates to a frisbee golf course up here by <br>
the college where I work. It's three lights away from the river. It's <br>
like golf...but in the woods.<br>
<br>
I left my house early this morning and walked around up there but <br>
didn't find any homemade art to look in. Some of the "poles" are <br>
decorated so I looked around those bases. By the time I left there <br>
were several people up there poking around...so they are thinking what <br>
I'm thinking. I thought maybe somebody beat me to it...but still no <br>
word on the radio. This is what happened last year...I gave up <br>
thinking someone MUST have found it by now.<br>
<br>
I'll try and sneak back over there. Keep those ideas coming!<br>
