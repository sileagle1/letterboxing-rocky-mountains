While there, my hubby and I had time to get in ONE letterbox (yeah, I know ... in Maryland, and only ONE box?) but the one we found was called Radio Days, and was most definitely in the city.<br/>
<br/>
It was a microbox - two black film canisters taped end to end.  Stamp in one side, log rolled into the other side.  The whole thing was velcro'd to a branch in a bush.  A bit hard to find, and so - will probably last a bit for an Urban box.<br/>
<br/>
Also - we didn't have time to do this one, but - there's also one INSIDE the National Zoo - check the clues for those boxes for some great ideas on city dweller boxes!  :)<br/>
