If you are the museum sort, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science is<br>
awesome - and has one of the very best views of Denver from their second<br>
floor (city park with downtown and the mountains beyond) - that gave ME a<br>
"wow" and I live here!  :)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would make a trip up to Boulder if you get a chance in fact, a great day<br>
jaunt would be Boulder, Estes Park (go to the top of Trail Ridge Road), and<br>
then you could come back the same way, or go around the loop and come back<br>
through Winter Park Assuming Trail Ridge is open by then.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Beautiful drive, great views the Boulder Mall on Pearl Street is always<br>
fun, and there are great boxes all along the way if you were so inclined.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
If youre not inclined to do a day jaunt (the one described above would be a<br>
FULL day), you could still get up to Boulder and back for a  day of<br>
adventure  stop at the Davidson Mesa overlook (on hwy 36 about 1 mile past<br>
McCaslin exit on the right side of the road its not well marked, but its<br>
a beautiful view of the whole front range Im hoping to plant a box there,<br>
this will motivate me to get it done before May!).<br>
<br>

And definitely let us know if youre up for a mini-meet.<br>

Fabulous and there are a few good boxes in Grand County (I hear that's what<br>
people say anyhow *wink*) if you come up and over and go back over Berthoud<br>
Pass.<br>
