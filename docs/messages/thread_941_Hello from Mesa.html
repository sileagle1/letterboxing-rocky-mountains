from Littleton and now...Puppypaws of Mesa.   A couple of you <br/>
contacted me earlier and said you wanted me to plant some letterboxes <br/>
for you in this area.  I am now ready to do this and have found a <br/>
couple of very neat places that I think would be great for a <br/>
letterbox.   If anyone wants to contact me off-line, I will give you <br/>
my address and phone number.  This is a beautiful time of year in <br/>
Arizona - just ask all the Snowbirds!!!  We sure need more boxes <br/>
here.   I have not been looking yet, but hope to find those near ASU <br/>
before long.   <br/>
