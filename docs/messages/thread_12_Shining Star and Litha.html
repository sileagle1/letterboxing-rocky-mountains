I'm so glad to hear that you found Litha.  No - whoever found it first,<br>
didn't say ANYTHING.   They didn't stamp, just left a note or something??<br>
Funhog (from Oregon) emailed me to tell me she hunted for it and couldn't<br>
locat it on the rock wall, so I clarified the clues a bit.  Glad you found<br>
it, I was a tad worried.<br>
<br>
The reason that box had nothing else in it was because it was planted on the<br>
hike.  Eric and I hiked up to find Rain Cloud, but missed a clue along the<br>
way (that tree with the woodpecker's handiwork slipped by unnoticed).<br>
Anywhoo ... we got to the power poles, and on a whim, sat down and carved a<br>
stamp, and hid that box.  We weren't prepared for doing so, and didn't have<br>
sheets to leave in the box like the others.  Ah well!!  Not bad for a spur<br>
of the moment, eh?<br>
<br>
Thanks for letting me know about it, and that its safe and well!<br>
<br>
:)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Autumn:  The first finders of Litha just signed their names, I think <br>
it was 4 people; no stamp or anything...it looks like they found it <br>
just a week or two ago.  I wonder if they just happened upon it <br>
rather than hunted for it.  I think they put it back in the wrong <br>
place because we almost didn't find it either.  So, we put it back <br>
where we thought you meant for it to go.  We wouldn't have found it <br>
but one of the group members we were with got up on the wall and <br>
walked along it; it was much further down than we thought it should <br>
be...your steps can't be that big!  Too bad Funhog didn't find it, <br>
we found their Shining Star...do they live locally?  They can go <br>
back to Litha and I think find it this time, anyway we think HOPE we <br>
put it where you intended, we certainly think so!<br>
