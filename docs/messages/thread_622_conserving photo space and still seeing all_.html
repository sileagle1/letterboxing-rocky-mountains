                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I have an idea to conserve space and add as many photos as we want so <br/>
that we can all share!!!<br/>
 I have set up a new account with Yahoo under the username lbadventures. I <br/>
created a folder in there that can have public access. I can post as many <br/>
photos as I want with no limitation. I can only put up to 300 in a folder, <br/>
but I can keep making folders. <br/>
 This means I could take photos from the site and add them all to the photos <br/>
page and post the link on the list. I think it will be a great idea and <br/>
provide no limitations on how many photos we share. <br/>
 I can think of a couple of down sides though. For one, I would have to be <br/>
the one to post things on there, so you could put photos on the list (or <br/>
email them to me) and I can put them in the photos page, but others can't <br/>
add or take them away. If someone wants one in or out. I can do it. I am <br/>
happy to do this though, and if anyone has concerns about a certain photo, I <br/>
could remove it immediately. Another possible concern is that in order for <br/>
us to let anyone on the list see them, I would have to leave it open for <br/>
public access. Much of Yahoo is like this anyway already and I don't have a <br/>
problem with this since I don't think we would put anything in there that <br/>
could be used maliciously, but I understand that some might have a problem <br/>
with it. The only other options are totally private (which defeats the <br/>
point) or me inviting certain email addresses (which could take forever and <br/>
change constantly.) <br/>
 Anyway, I think this might be a nice option. I've seen some do it already. <br/>
Ryan's old website had links to his yahoo photos page so other letterboxers <br/>
could look at his photos if they wanted to. I thought it worked well in that <br/>
situation. <br/>
 If you want to see how it works, I already added a couple pictures into the <br/>
"links" section of the list. I can take it off easily, but I thought I'd <br/>
give you a couple of pictures to let you see how it works. You can still <br/>
download pictures, print them, order photos or gifts with those photos <br/>
without my permission. I think it will even let you have 10 free <br/>
professional prints. Of course there is no charge to save or print it <br/>
yourself. Let me know what you think. If I feel you all like it, I will <br/>
start transferring photos over!<br/>

I think this is a great idea. It is easy for everybody (except Cadenza) <br/>
and I don't have a problem with public access to the photos.<br/>

I think it's a great idea, Cadenza!  Thanks for tackling this <br/>
problem.  I would love to see as many of the pics that others are <br/>
able to share!  It just makes it so much fun!  Feel free to delete <br/>
any of the ones I uploaded as you see fit (duplicates, etc.) <br/>
<br/>
Hugs, Peach<br/>

Another great solution is over at Flickr. It would allow for <br/>
as many pics as we all want, organizes into files, multiple <br/>
people can upload/share, etc.<br/>

We're using it for my brother's wedding that was this past <br/>
Saturday.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I was completely ready to sign us up for a free account without even <br/>
asking the group. I love some of the features, especially the ability to tag <br/>
the photos in a way that you can run your cursor over the photo and have <br/>
something pop up telling you who that person is or putting a comment there.<br/>
 As I dug a bit more though, I'm not sure that we would be happy with just <br/>
the free account. There are strong limits to how much can be uploaded--only <br/>
10 MB/month. This is about what we already have in the photos section of the <br/>
list. So we would only be able to upload that much and we would have to wait <br/>
another month to do any more. My other concern is that the free accounts <br/>
won't allow saving the original photo size, only a smaller one. So if we <br/>
want to print photos at home, we aren't going to get the same quality. <br/>
 I just did some digging in Yahoo photos as well. It saves three sizes of <br/>
prints and you can get a slightly larger one, but it appears the full size <br/>
original is only available if you are purchasing prints (isn't that tricky <br/>
of them?) This is annoying. I want to access the full size from both sites, <br/>
but at least Yahoo saves the full size one. I wish there was a free site <br/>
that didn't have the space limitations! Anyway, I better get back to work.<br/>

 ps. Here's a description from flickr's FAQ section:<br/>
 Absolutely! And you can take advantage of our special beta offer, and <br/>
upgrade to a Pro Account for just US$41.77 a year. Here's what you'll get <br/>
with a Pro Account:<br/>
<br/>
   - 1 GB monthly upload limit <br/>
   - Unlimited storage <br/>
   - Unlimited bandwidth <br/>
   - Unlimited photosets <br/>
   - Permanent archiving of high-resolution original images <br/>
   - Ad-free browsing and sharing (**coming soon) <br/>
<br/>
Compare that to what you get with a Free Account:<br/>
<br/>
   - 10 MB monthly upload limit <br/>
   - 3 photosets <br/>
   - Photostream views limited to the 100 most recent images <br/>
   - Storage of smaller (resized) images<br/>
<br/>
