<br>
I went to double check it after editing the clues....I found that 30-<br>
50 linear feet of bushes where the box was are GONE, so's my box!<br>
<br>
Stoopid Gardners.  I'll think about replacing this one, but it's <br>
probably gonna take a bit.  It was tough even to find the hiding spot <br>
I thought would be sticking around awhile.<br>
