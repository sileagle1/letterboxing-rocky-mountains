 <br>
Maggie, Matthew & I headed to Parker this morning and were able to find<br>
TWENTY MILE and HARRY'S HEAVEN.  Both in great shape.  The bush in the<br>
clue for Harry's Heaven in a little mushed down.<br>
 <br>
Then we headed to Challenger Park for a short break, lunch and play<br>
time.  If you haven't been to this park - it is really nice.  My oldest<br>
daughter, Jessica, plays some soccer away games there.<br>

 <br>
Woody was a mess =[  So, I replaced the log book, changed the stamps<br>
towel and gave it a baggie.  I did this at the site, so it is still<br>
there and findable.<br>
 <br>
Dual Mindedness was still damp.  The log book was close to full, so I<br>
gave it a new one and cleaned the stamp (it will go back out this week)<br>
 <br>
T-I-Double-Guh-Er was in good shape.  I dried out the inside of the box,<br>
put it all back together and laid in back to wait.<br>
 <br>
I wasn't able to make it to the other boxes - the kids wore out.  I plan<br>
to try and check some more this week.  I know Oh, Dear! and Oh, Bother<br>
I cna't check till I have someone to go with me, so it may be a month or<br>
so (we have plans for the next 3 weekends).  However, if anyone makes it<br>
out to either of those boxes and wants to give a report, I would be<br>
appreciative! =]<br>
