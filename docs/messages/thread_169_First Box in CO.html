               I don't know how many of you have been following the <br>
big list, but there have been some interesting discussions about the <br>
first boxes placed in each state. There is an old archive list that <br>
says Colorado's first box was placed by Drewclan on July 13, 2000. I <br>
looked at the boxes around my neck of the woods and noticed that <br>
Andrews Lake box was placed by Brookes/Devere, also on July 13, 2000. <br>
               Could it be that we have a tie for first box placed in <br>
Colorado? What are the chances of that? Maybe Jay or Autumn could <br>
shed more light on this.<br>
