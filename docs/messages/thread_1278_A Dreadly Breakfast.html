delightfully fortunate as to have breakfast with Peach and Cappy!  <br/>
Which is *much* better than the serious case of cooties I had before I <br/>
met them.  That seems to have cleared up now.  Well, for me at least.<br/>
<br/>
Poor Cappy... I think Peach and I could talk about boxing forever.. <br/>
plus three days!  I am so ready for hiking and finding and stamping now!<br/>
<br/>
Any of you who have completed the Pirate King need to track this Dread <br/>
Peach down and ask to see her scrapbook.  Hokey smoke..if I didn't love <br/>
her I would have looted it for me own!  Just be careful not to catch <br/>
anything from her.<br/>

Es, doing a western style pirate jig while shouting 'enough with the <br/>
snow already' to the mountains and dreaming of a road trip with lots of <br/>
ink and snacks<br/>
