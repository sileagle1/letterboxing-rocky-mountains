Whoaaaa! Haven't been online for awhile (my mom &amp; dad arrived in <br/>
town yesterday for the week) and just as I thought I was coming down <br/>
from my weekend letterboxing high, I started reading all the <br/>
postings here. Now my brain is all aflutter again, with all the fun <br/>
conversations going on here! I don't even know where to begin! <br/>
<br/>
And....... to keep seeing all the new box clues that have been <br/>
arriving regularly in the last day or so are TOO MUCH FUN. (Note to <br/>
self, pace, pace, pace, don't find them all at once, make the fun <br/>
last.) Kennamtn went out of town for 5 days, and I don't know if I <br/>
have the will power to resist finding them all without her. But then <br/>
of course I wouldn't have to push her off any cliffs to get the <br/>
FF's, hmmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Now where and what is this place everyone is talking about for the <br/>
next event, for of course there MUST be another event!<br/>
<br/>
And............. Big Snaps to the Idaho boxers who left us soooo <br/>
many wonderful hidden treasures! Between your long drive down and <br/>
all your plantings, I think you did way more work than any of us <br/>
locals!!!!  Awesomeness, thanks sooooo much! Your talents are much <br/>
welcome in this neck of the woods. We have quite a representation of <br/>
different boxers in the area now!<br/>
<br/>
Gotta go to bed now, brain overload AGAIN!<br/>
