Dear Twinville Trekker Mom,<br>
<br>
You sound like me! My kids enjoy letterboxing but not for the hours <br>
that I do. For some reason, they just don't seem up to the LONG hikes <br>
(except the 13yo Boy Scout) or the full day of getting in and out of <br>
the car. :-( <br>
<br>
Hey...maybe we should get together somewhere for a mom's getaway LBing <br>
retreat ;-) <br>
<br>
God bless,<br>
TX AF Family Mom<br>
