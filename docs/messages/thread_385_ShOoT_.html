Oh - Esmerelda - I wanted to thank you for some inspiration. It's <br>
really hard to find a tupperware box and a sketchbook that match in <br>
size. I saw that you hand make all of your journals, so I went out <br>
and got a few books and learned how!<br>
<br>
Now I can make the book to custom fit the box, and I can make it look <br>
however I want! <br>
<br>
Thank you for the brilliant idea!<br>

Well, I hate to say thanks because I didn't actually do anything <br>
helpful, but thanks for the nice note!<br>
It's fun making the journals, isn't it?  You can make any size,  <br>
shape, color or whatever that you want!<br>

But you did! I didn't even think about making my own journals until I <br>
saw yours! I don't think I've ever seen anyone but you make their own.<br>
You provided the spark of inspiration! <br>
<br>
It IS fun. And it really isn't that hard - I was surprised. Mine are <br>
different than yours. Do you sew the signatures? Or do you just glue <br>
the whole thing?<br>

I sew and glue.  I should have purchased stock from the glue company <br>
before I started. I'm just saying.<br>
