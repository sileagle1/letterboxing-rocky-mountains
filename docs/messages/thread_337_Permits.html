They called me earlier this week about one of my boxes they couldn't<br>
find.  Of course, I had to explain what an idiot I was because I was on<br>
a different trail from where I thought I was... they got a good laugh!<br>

 <br>
But, I still haven't gotten approval or denial... <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I heard from Kathy @ Open Space on Wednesday.  My King of All He Surveys<br>
and Rattlesnack Gulch were approved and I will have the permit approval<br>
in my hands soon.<br>
 <br>
However, as I knew - Swimming in Opposite Directions was denied... they<br>
did ask that I get out there ASAP to pull it.  I told her I put the<br>
unavailable note on the website so people would think it wasn't there...<br>
it is soccer season and if I get out there before it ends, it will be<br>
pretty amazing... and of course, as soon as it ends, the snow starts.<br>
ACK.<br>
 <br>
Also - I took responsibility for a mystery box that is in the area.<br>
They denied that box... because it isn't on their property!  They told<br>
me I need find out who owns the property and contact them... ok - well<br>
the gave me 4 different places to check with!  Not so sure I am going to<br>
go to the trouble.  What do you all think?<br>
