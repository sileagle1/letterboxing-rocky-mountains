now log my signature stamps as "other" finds.  I have started making <br>
new signature stamps and loved this fun idea from SHH while she and <br>
Triple T were in Boise last week.  So even if you exchange with me <br>
once you might want to track me down again because you never know <br>
which signature stamps I may have on me at the time.  I have even <br>
loaded the images into a photo album so there is no confusion as to <br>
which ones you may have.  Here are the details:<br>
<br>
I have started to finally branch out from the tried and true <br>
signature stamps we have been using forever. Instead of just one set <br>
of stamps we have several now. I wanted to give my LB friends a <br>
chance to log in their exchanges with me, Lizman, Raisin and Jay. As <br>
I create more signature stamps I will add them to the list. Make sure <br>
when we cross paths to check and see what I have with me and who is <br>
traveling with me. You just never know what I may have!<br>
