I was on my way up to Buena Vista area today and just had to stop<br>
in Bailey for a few boxes.  Well, 4 hours and 4 boxes later and<br>
it was too late to go there.  In all I found 6 boxes including 2 <br>
Hitchhikers!!  Woo hoo!<br>
Found near bailey Dragons Lair/Alberts Squirrel and Parasite <br>
box/Payne Gulch BKC (where I found one the first HH).  Then decided <br>
on the way back home to nab RC Cola and a Moon Pie Letterboxes at <br>
Meyer Ranch Open Space (where I found the 2nd HH).  The last hike for <br>
RC Cola was the most beautiful one with yellow aspen leaves all over <br>
the ground and the trees next to me.  It was awe inspiring.  I didnt <br>
place either of the HH yet...look for them in a LB near you soon!<br>
