Could you find a spot when you were here then once approval comes you<br>
could have them go place it for you?<br>

OR - you could place it... then send in an application, stating you were<br>
unaware it was OPen Space when you planted it and that someone just<br>
emailed you telling you about the permiting process =]<br>

This will make it very difficult for out-of-towners<br>
to place a box if they must find a spot and get approval <br>
first, since they might not be in the area long enough<br>
to actually hide the box, even if approval is given.<br>
I guess we will just have to avoid these places requiring<br>
approval.<br>
