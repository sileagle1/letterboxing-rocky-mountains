Come on.  Arrrrrrr.  I wouldn't wear the skirt and corset.. pretty <br>
tough to hike around a mountain like that.  But I have so much pirate <br>
stuff it would make you sick.  We could be very nattily dressed yuppy <br>
pirates in Columbia sportswear and colorful sashes.  And socks.  <br>
<br>
How funny that we all see different stuff at the link!  Cracks me the <br>
heck up!<br>

Es, who can't even find her shoes but would still love to run around a <br>
mountain shouting out pirate phrases and looking for stuff<br>

Scroll down to the bottom of the page linked for the two flyer looking <br>
thingies with the pirate stuff. The flyers themselves have the dates <br>
and locations! <br>
<br>
The left one says @ Loveland on the right side and just above in the <br>
upper most corner is the date (April 1st).  The right one is for Taos <br>
(March 16th).  Click the flyer you're interested in for more info.  <br>
Once you do, the text says "2007" scavenger hunts....and the flyer on <br>
each page is the same as before you linked..<br>
<br>
Or should.....unless maybe the link I'm seeing just fine doesn't work.  <br>
<br>
Does that make sense?<br>

the "official Ye Olde Scavenger Hunt Schwag!!  <br>

I'd give twelvety and 69 1/2 dubloons to witness that little, ummm <br>
SPECTACLE (snort ).  OK, wait....maybe just some pictuers and we <br>
call it my April Fools PREssie. ;-p<br>
<br>
I've had my fill of GS cookies lately, but I noticed that there is <br>
BEER!  Imagine that?<br>
<br>
And speaking of....the reason I found this Hunt thing in the first <br>
place is 'cause someone hasn't claimed a Belgian Brewery bottle <br>
opener @ work, so I'm gonna snag it.  Which lead, naturally to <br>
boxing ideas, so I went surfing.  I just want that little LB stamp <br>
looking thingy on the flyers, so if you guys do go, and there's a <br>
print version of the poster...can someone grab one for me purty <br>
please?<br>
<br>
My wonderful brother bribed me with an airplane ticket to Portland <br>
for Fools Day weekend to spend time with my adorable nephew I've <br>
only met once.  If we manage to work in a trip to the Pacific Ocean <br>
I'm gonna be one VERY happy preboxed!  I'll salute westward for the <br>
Mountain Pirates!<br>
