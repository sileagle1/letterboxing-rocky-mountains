                    <div class="plaintext-content">While we anxiously await the next installment of Dread's sweet <br>
story, I have a request. <br>
 <br>
If anyone is going to be in the area of Rocky Mountain Clydesdales <br>
and would check on it for me, I'll hoist a tankard of ale and down a <br>
slab of pie in your honor! And be eternally grateful!<br>
<br>
A family was unable to find it last week, but it was their first box <br>
so they weren't sure if they were in the right spot.  Plus, anyone <br>
who's been there knows that the bush has about a bajillion leaves <br>
under it that the box likes to migrate into.  So.. I hate to call it <br>
missing until I know for sure!  Actually, I hate to call it missing <br>
even if I DO know for sure! Blimey, as Dread would say!<br>
<br>
On another note, new journals went into Grizzly Creek and Buffalo <br>
Bill today.  An all new Little Raven was hidden in a new spot and a <br>
mystery box dedicated to the evil Bean is snuggled into it's home.  <br>
Clues will go up when I get some more days off and can hunker down <br>
and do them right. <br>
 <br>
Is this a fun hobby or what?<br>
<br>
Es, who had a blast reading full journals, climbing around mountains <br>
and peeking under a hundred different rocks today<br>

JeLyroger on this, BUT, I will hunker down and give ye a "gentle <br>
pirates" head start since ye ought to be first for your special <br>
box.  However, matey, I have to admit that I can't wait to see what <br>
me heartie has come up with, she is just so darn creative and it <br>
tickles me spine in anticipation!<br>
<br>
I have to share with you all that it was a delight to run into the H-<br>
A's while standing next in line to board a crazy and wild coaster at <br>
the island called Elitches today!  WOOT!  Who knew!  We were there <br>
following the Juvenile Diabetes Walk for a Cure and they just <br>
happened to be there too!  I didn't recognize Jrsyboy at first, with <br>
a black scarf tied to his head, why, I thought he was just another <br>
pirate!  Ha!  eerrr...H-A!<br>
<br>
So, ye all be careful, ye never know where the Dread Peach will pop <br>
up to keep and eye on ye all!<br>

Hugs, Dread....waiting, waiting, patiently waiting and contemplating <br>
what amount of time that JeLy needs to reach his special box before <br>
Peach and Cappy set sail....ahhh, well, Peach needs to get to work <br>
on Part 3...is that a DOG little Wolf?<br>
