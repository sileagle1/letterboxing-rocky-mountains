I've also been a lot lazier than I anticipated this winter--where carving is<br>

somewhere on the Nez Perce trail to honor him.<br>

One of the disadvantages of living out here with no other letterboxers is<br>
that I am able to share my stamps with so few people.  I catch some coming<br>
and going on their way to Yellowstone and a few have come for family<br>
reunions.  Now I find myself torn.  I want to share the carving with some<br>
others, but I hate taking away from the fun discovery of opening a box to<br>
find a cool carving that you hadn't anticipated.  I feel like you all would<br>
be fun to share with, but I also realize that if anyone is more likely to<br>
make it up to the region I'd likely plant in, it would be Rocky Mtn types.<br>
<br>
I don't know.  What think ye?<br>

I can't WAIT to get out there and box!  Though I must admit ... I had<br>
planned to take the long winter months indoors as an opportunity to carve a<br>
bunch, and get some boxes together (finish that Wheel series) ... but alas<br>
... I've been a lazy bum!  So - I'll be carving furiously this spring, and<br>
planting, too.<br>
<br>
We need to schedule another gathering when the weather breaks.<br>
Best wishes,<br>

I would say continue to place boxes and people will eventually<br>
come.  I was in the same boat here in Texas over a year ago,<br>
but some of my boxes are now seeing some visits.  Also, Baby<br>
Bear and I are planning on coming up that way to go backpacking<br>
in Glacier National Park this summer and we plan to letterbox<br>
as much as possible in Idaho and Montana.  Even though we did<br>
the Nez Perce trail two years ago, a new letterbox could persuade<br>
us to do some again.  In fact, once we finalize our plans, maybe<br>
we can plan to meet you and A-Bear somewhere.  Looking forward<br>
to seeing your work!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just received a couple of days ago Cadenza's Mountian High PLB#2 in my mailbox.  How excited I was to finally see some of her gorgeous work!!  I had planned to meet up with Cadenza during a trip up to Montana and it did not work out, so this was all the more sweeter!!  <br>
<br>
Cadenza, continue to place boxes and let the hobby take you where it is gonna take you.  You do awesome work and anybody to find one of your boxes is very lucky!!  I have been wanting to place boxes, but my creativity is not anywhere to be seen at the moment!!  I only hope that I can do work that is somewhat close to the quality, workmanship and thought that your boxes have!!<br>
<br>
I think it would be awesome to have a RM Gathering somewhere in the middle of all of us.  If it is in summer time and on a long weekend and planned far enough into the future, I think a good number fo people would show up.  Maybe we pick a place like North Western Colo or just over the border in Wyoming or Utah.  I would certainly go for that!!  Especially if we can find a place with camping.  Well, folks, I have to try and get some reall work done!!<br>
<br>
Talk to ya'all soon!!<br>
