Boxes Alive & Well<br>
Camping Trials<br>
McCall, Idaho<br>
Scratchin' Post: Box # 1<br>
Horse Bells: Box # 2<br>
A-Bear Planted these back in 2003 they are both alive and well.  The <br>
trail was pretty muddy, there was a fallen tree at about .7 miles on <br>
the forest service road and there is still snow but the boxes are <br>
safe and dry.  Somehow I left the campsite without my personal stamp <br>
and ink so I was only able to sign in  DUH!<br>
<br>
