suggestion to make the "R"s print backward?  If you remember, they <br>
were backwards when you read the word in the movie.  We loved your <br>
box :)  Please don't take it wrong, such a technical suggestion. <br>

We could also help out with this, as we regularly go to Estes Park (once or twice a week).  We are actively out of town, but will be back two days after the Ren. Festival gathering.<br>
<br>
Having pulled this box once before for repairs, we can say that its placement indeed requires a sturdier box.  If the finder doesn't put it back properly, it gets crushed.  That is what happened previously.<br>

I replied to Melissa since I am probably the second closest to Estes after Aljan.  If anyone else wants to help her that is okay, but I just want to say that I have volunteered to help.<br>
