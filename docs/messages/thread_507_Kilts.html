Yes, many thanks to Lisa for putting me in touch with the 'boxer in <br>
Scotland!<br>

I am still negotiating with the Scottish Office of Kilting Standards <br>
(SOKS) on that issue.  We are first narrowing in on agreement of <br>
what to wear under the kilt, and then we will move on to wool <br>
weight, length, choice of tartan, and whether I will be allowed to <br>
appear in it in public or in front of children.<br>
