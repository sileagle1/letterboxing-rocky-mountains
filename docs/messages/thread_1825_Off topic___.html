CHEER for Grand Lake and help us save our school!  You may have seen this<br/>
going around on FaceBook.  I'm not 100% sure of the details, but there is a<br/>
multimillion dollar prize for the winning towns.  If Grand Lake wins, part<br/>
of the money has already been promised for keeping Grand Lake elemetary<br/>
OPEN!  Outside of a financial miracle like this one, Grand Lake Elementary<br/>
is almost certain to CLOSE next school year!  Once closed, it is not likely<br/>
to repoen, EVER!  Grand Lake Elementary had some serious spirit and is vital<br/>
to our kids and our town.<br/>
<br/>
So, please, take a few minutes each day to cheer for Grand Lake!<br/>
