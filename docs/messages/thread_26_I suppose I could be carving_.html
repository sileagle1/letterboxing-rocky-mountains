<div>Well, I have carved my first stamp!!  It is 
the sig stamp for my daughter.  Still haven't gone out to actually find any 
yet, but may be doing that today or tomorrow since it is finally supposed to be 
cooler!!  I haven't gotten a stamp carved for me yet as I am not at all 
competent in even tracing a picture.  I have tried several times and the 
picture is just not coming out right, so I think that I am just going to do a 
name stamp for now and see what I can come up with as far as getting that Ewok 
on to a stamp.  Several people on the main list offered to carve one for 
me, but I would really like to try myself first.  It's the fur that is 
driving me crazy!!  </div>
