<br>
Now that we have officially found (and planted) some boxes in the Rocky <br>
Mountain region, I'd like to purchase a patch to add to my pack.  Is <br>
one available?  If so, how can I purchase?<br>
<br>
I see that Silent Doug posted a pretty cool design in the Files section <br>
of this board a few years ago, and it also looks like some other ideas <br>
were suggested, but I'm not finding anything definite that a patch was <br>
ever produced.  If not, I can recommend a pretty good company to get <br>
them made, since I'm the one who got the Great Lakes patches produced <br>
(and I've sold 400 over the past 3 years).  Here's an example of what <br>
they can do:  http://letterboxing.homestead.com/greatlakespatch.html<br>

although designs were kicked around, no patches were ever made. <br>
However, if one is ever produced, I'd definitely by a bunch. They'd <br>
make great FF gifts, don't you think? That Great Lakes patch is <br>
awesome!<br>

You need to submit a final design with the colors you want.  For example,<br>
all you would need to do is email them a .jpg of what you want, similar to<br>
the RockyMountainLetterboxing.jpg  that Silent Doug posted.  They would then<br>
create a sample and email you a scanned image of the patch.  If it met with<br>
your approval, they would then create the quantity you requested and mail<br>

<br>
Here are a few more details re: the process:<br>
<br>
We used the design for our Yahoo group as our patch design.  The art was created by SpringChick.<br>
<br>
I sent a .jpg file of the design to the patch company.<br>
<br>
They sent me a .jpg image of the sample patch they created.  <br>
<br>
I posted the sample image to our Yahoo group (Photos section) so everyone could see it and comment. After receiving comments, I asked the patch company to modify some colors slightly.  They then created another sample and sent another image.<br>
<br>
I created a database in our Yahoo group so people could add their name and the  number of patches they would want.  If you haven't used the database feature before, I highly recommend it!  It keeps all the info in one place, rather than a whole bunch of separate email messages.  Anyone can create a database and you can define it to allow anyone to add data to it.<br>
<br>
When I had a feel for how many patches total we wanted, I placed an order with the patch company. I ordered more than the initial requests so I would have a stock for future orders.  I don't remember, but I think the minimum order is 50 patches.  Of course the higher the quantity, the lower the price.  You'll want to get the full quote from the patch company before you advertise an exact price, since the order will also include some shipping and handling charges.<br>
<br>
I never promoted the patch on any other website other than our regional Yahoo group, but when Mark Pepe created a "Patches" page on his blog, I sent him a link so it could be included.  If you want to generate a bigger demand to lower the price, you may want to promote the patch on a few other sites.<br>
<br>
Whoever the individual is that ends up in charge of selling the patches, I highly recommend that you ask people to send you self-addressed stamped envelopes.  That makes it very easy to fulfill the orders.<br>
<br>
For reference, here is the link to our Great Lakes patch, so you can see how I distributed the final info about ordering.  <br>
<br>
http://letterboxing.homestead.com/greatlakespatch.html<br>
<br>
You could put similar info in the Files section of your group, or a blog or wherever.  I'm totally out of stock of our patches after selling 200 of our original design and then another 200 of a revised design after Minnesota was included in our group.  I'll probably place another order after I get a backlog of requests.<br>
<br>
I hope your patch becomes a reality so I can add it to my pack! <br>

bought a small compass a Walgreen's a few weeks ago for a backpacking <br>

the time in the canyon where cell phones don't work).<br>

noticed an important flaw......the little needle with the N on it <br>
points SOUTH! Elros and I went through a pretty long giggling fit <br>

<br>
..that the little needle with the N on it points SOUTH! but did NOT <br>
when it was purchased. Many of pre's first finders (*cough, FRH in <br>
particular cough*) went through a period with many fits of <br>
frustration thinking that silly blonde preboxed, after more than a <br>
year of successfully placing boxes, suddenly became unable to <br>
properly write clues which included compass bearings.  Well-trained <br>
and quite expert (but now unfortunate) 'boxers following my compass <br>
bearing for paces (or steps) for miles while reading pre's <br>
clues.  "The Letterboxer Placer told us that if we just head north <br>
we'll find that *&%$ letterbox...."!!<br>
<br>
This went on for months!  I became completely paranoid when writing <br>
my clue notes...checking, double checking...triple checking...just to <br>
be ...wrong again!<br>
<br>
Thanks goodness I'd bought the silly thing from REI.  When I <br>
finallllly figured out that my compass had become PREcisely 180 <br>
degrees off, they exchanged it for a brand new one.<br>
<br>
Boy did I feel like a goofball.  FRH still talks to me, though.:-) <br>
The rest of you probably suspect that I might actually be a <br>
goofball...just be glad you weren't one of my FFs during that time!<br>

Dear Jeannie in a bottle...<br>
<br>
please don't ban me for being weird! Or not being able to type on <br>
PREcent posts.<br>
<br>
Seriously: I was PREcently on the beach..dreaming of Genie's in a <br>
bottle...dad will love his bday pressie..<br>
<br>
Anyway: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIN3l1edRA0<br>
<br>
The ONE thing missing from Colorado...is the sea.  After spending the <br>
DOUGH, to go home to California...I hiked and hiked..up, up, up.  A <br>
piece of pie (ok bread) for us high altitude folks.  <br>
<br>
I found what I'd been dreaming of lately., having spent the dough to <br>
take the trip, to one of my favorite places on the entire face of the <br>
planet...<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Cool!  The database is a very useful feature.  We've used it on the Great<br>
Lakes board for people to list what campsites they have reserved for an<br>
event, who want to buy patches, what stamp images they are carving for an<br>
event, etc.  I also let the Texas board know about this handy feature and<br>
they used it to track the food people were bring for a potluck event.<br>

Can't wait to see the final color design for your patch!<br>
