<br>
I'm heading to the Springs for a conference in a couple of weeks, and <br>
was just wondering if anyone could tell me some boxes that might be <br>
accessible even with all the snow we've gotten. Here in Littleton, <br>
most boxes are still buried under quite a lot of white stuff! <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

because of snow, then possibly because of mud.<br>
<br>
A couple you might want to consider:<br>
- It's A Mystery<br>
- Little Feet (there was a missing report on this one, I haven't gotten <br>
to check on it, but some time overzealous little hands shove this far <br>
back where big hands can't reach it, but a stick or wire coat-hanger <br>
might help)<br>
- Some of CODogScouts' boxes might be accessible<br>
