I've just had a thought and if I post more on the big list, I may <br/>
kill some cats :0  <br/>
<br/>
I haven't been able to dig in for a while with my computer woes, but <br/>
I let myself break the rules a bit and use my computer at work to <br/>
check a couple of personal things, then I decided to check if I had <br/>
any mail at Atlas Quest and now here I am having spent nearly four <br/>
hours going through Atlas quest, LBNA, the main list, this one, <br/>
catching up in Mark and Sue Pepe's blog (which I love!) and reading <br/>
tributes to classic letterboxers.  <br/>
<br/>
Wow! I'd forgotten how much I have learned to love this community.  <br/>
It doesn't seem comprehensible that it has been nearly two years <br/>
since I began letterboxing.  I had no idea what I was beginning when <br/>
I clicked on a tiny reference in my email newsletter.   I need to get <br/>
a new computer so I can do this in smaller increments (I say that but <br/>
it seemed to take about as long when I was checking regularly too!)I <br/>
just wanted to take a moment to express gratitude to my fellow <br/>
addicts for the quirky community we are.  It is so fun to be a part <br/>
of all of you! <br/>
<br/>
I better go get some sleep so I can wake up in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
Happy holidays!<br/>

My home computer was down for three weeks recently which made me <br/>
realize how much of a computer/letterboxer geek I am. I would go to <br/>
work early and stay late just to check the letterboxing boards and <br/>
look at the new clues. Even when the boards are quiet it would drive <br/>
me crazy to think I was missing out on a cool thread. There are a lot <br/>
of fun people in these groups, that is for sure, and even though I <br/>
haven't met any of you face to face, I have to get my fix regularly <br/>
or I start to jones.<br/>
