new location for it, but, somehow it's gone missing for a second time!  <br>
Murmur, I think you had just found it on the 30th. Today, I was emailed <br>
by somebody unfamiliar to me saying that they found the box yesterday <br>
and that it was inside its' large ziplock bag, but everything in the <br>
box was gone!  Nice, huh?  They took the time to rehide the empty box!  <br>
Scalliwags!  May they be seeing BLACK SPOTS!<br>
<br>
We're considering combining the boxes because MILE HIGH seems to be <br>
okay where it is.  So, when we get a chance to do that, we'll post it <br>
here and on the clues.  <br>
<br>
I just wanted all you mini-meet people to know, just in case you go <br>
looking for it this weekend.  Sorry!<br>
<br>
Dread Peach, not happy about the bummer news on the day that the <br>
Broncos released this season's schedule...should be a great season, <br>
tho!  GO BRONCOS!<br>
