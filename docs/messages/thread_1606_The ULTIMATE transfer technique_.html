One of the questions always asked is "How do you transfer a design <br/>
onto the carving material?" <br/>
<br/>
Some people trace it with tracing, or carbon paper. I favor printing <br/>
it, and then using either acetone, or wintergreen oil to transfer. It <br/>
works better than tracing.<br/>
<br/>
But I have found the ultimate technique! It's like you have printed <br/>
your design right onto the pink stuff! (Or white stuff, or orange <br/>
stuff...)<br/>
<br/>
Custom temporary tattoo paper. Yep. Those same silly things that you <br/>
used to plaster all over your arms when you were a kid. It sticks to <br/>
the rubber just like it does your skin. You can buy blank sheets, and <br/>
run them through either your laser or inkjet printer, put them on <br/>
your carving material and Voila! Perfect, easy to see, easy to follow <br/>
crisp black lines.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You can get 5 sheets for about $11. WOOT!<br/>

I think my personal favorite technique is still ironing onto the carving block from a xerox copy of the image. Works awesome for me. I would recommend it if you haven't tried it yet.<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

I've been using the Xylene blender pens and I have one I want to finish off before I try anything new.  I am definitely planning to try both of those techniques.  How would you describe the difference in terms of the transferred image?  And are you still carving on the pink stuff?<br/>

&gt; I know that several of you here don't check out AtlasQuest, so I <br/>
will <br/>
&gt; re-post here. I want all of my Rocky Mountain friends to share in <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; new discovery!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the questions always asked is "How do you transfer a design <br/>
&gt; onto the carving material?" <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some people trace it with tracing, or carbon paper. I favor <br/>
printing <br/>
&gt; it, and then using either acetone, or wintergreen oil to transfer. <br/>
It <br/>
&gt; works better than tracing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I have found the ultimate technique! It's like you have printed <br/>
&gt; your design right onto the pink stuff! (Or white stuff, or orange <br/>
&gt; stuff...)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Custom temporary tattoo paper. Yep. Those same silly things that <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; used to plaster all over your arms when you were a kid. It sticks <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; the rubber just like it does your skin. You can buy blank sheets, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; run them through either your laser or inkjet printer, put them on <br/>
&gt; your carving material and Voila! Perfect, easy to see, easy to <br/>
follow <br/>
&gt; crisp black lines.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://www.texascraft.com/hps/home.php?cat=304<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can get 5 sheets for about $11. WOOT!<br/>

would use it. =3<br/>
<br/>
After you transfer the tattoo onto the rubber, it remains somewhat <br/>
sticky. Just rub a little bit of baby powder onto it, and that takes <br/>
care of the problem.<br/>
<br/>
I'm anxious to hear what people think!<br/>

Yesh! Who can't use several sheets of PZKut! We also won a 'goober <br/>
gun'? We haven't tried it yet, but it is supposed to dispense that <br/>
gooey stuff that you get on ads in magazines and such. It's for gluing <br/>
paper, etc. I had never heard of one. We shall see...<br/>
