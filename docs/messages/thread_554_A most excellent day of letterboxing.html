I finally managed to spend another day in Moab on the great <br/>
letterbox hunt.<br/>
<br/>
After 8 letterboxes and a hitchhiker, the sun was setting and I had <br/>
to call it a day.  I do NOT know how those east coasters do 30 boxes <br/>
in one day!!!  Even if they were stacked on top of each other how do <br/>
you do the whole stamping, stamping, writing, rebagging, yada yada <br/>
thing for 30 boxes?!  But I digress.  The weather was just perfect.. <br/>
couldn't have asked for better.  <br/>
<br/>
I started the morning at Fisher Towers searching for Alien Gothic. <br/>
Oh. My. Heck.  Aside from the fact that this is a wonderfully <br/>
written and made letterbox, I can still picture the scene layed out <br/>
before me as I stood on a ridge staring in awe at the unreal <br/>
landscape just glowing in the early morning light as far as you can <br/>
see.  I stopped many, many times and said, 'oh my gosh!' out loud <br/>
more times than I can count.  If you make it out to the Moab area?  <br/>
You're gonna want to find this box.  I'm just sayin'. :)<br/>
<br/>
I worked my way down Highway 128 and found Colorado River, Paddle <br/>
Hard, Searching (and, yes, that IS an Ent up that canyon!), and <br/>
Bighorn Sheep.  At Bighorn I was standing at the plaque decyphering <br/>
the clues when an older couple (even older than me) pulled up to <br/>
look at the river.  I just kept decyphering, said, 'Good morning, <br/>
I'm decyphering a clue!', when she looked over my shoulder.  The man <br/>
just thought I was nuts but the wife went,  'Oooooh!', like, 'now I <br/>
don't think you're crazy anymore!' hehehe.  A few miles down the <br/>
road I actually saw 4 real life bighorn sheep!<br/>
<br/>
On into Moab to finally.. FINALLY... capture Left Hand box (you <br/>
might have seen the fireworks go off).  All the bushes in that <br/>
canyon are starting to bud out.  Gorgeous.  Plus, I didn't even need <br/>
a clue sheet anymore.. after four attempts it's like being in my own <br/>
backyard.  heee.  Arrtoy Kpra was next and I attempted to get the <br/>
Birthday Box but wasn't able to find it.  I also picked up a <br/>
hitchhiker and a bonus box along the way.. I was so busy hiking I <br/>
forgot to stop for pie!<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend the Moab area to anyone thinking about a road <br/>
trip.  The local boxers and y-nought have created a most excellent <br/>
letterboxing spot. <br/>
<br/>
Es, who forgot to take her journal with her but is still smiling <br/>
from a really lovely day<br/>

Woot!<br/>
<br/>
I believe this qualifies you for the Royal Order of Cisco-Mo-Mo which <br/>
is traditionally celebrated with pie.<br/>
<br/>
All this talk about letterboxing by the H-A's and TDG was making me <br/>
crave a good stamping. And now this?<br/>
<br/>
I've gotta get some clues printed and get out there......soon.<br/>
<br/>
y-nought, twitching, just a little.<br/>

stomping grounds.  I was far enough away in college and growing up to<br/>
not be able to spend nearly as much time as I would like there, but I<br/>
just love the Moab area!!<br/>
<br/>
When I was working as a drug rehab counselor, we used to go down there<br/>
once a month for what we called "intensive day."  I loved those days. <br/>
It was hard to tell who was getting more out of them, me or the<br/>
clients :)  This is really making me want to head south.  Now if I<br/>
could just find a weekend I'm not committed . . .  I don't think I<br/>
can! :(  Why oh why can't I find spare time!<br/>

OK, I have made explicit notes of these boxes for my trip down south<br/>
later this month.  Anyone else know of any boxes that just cannot be<br/>
missed.  From I-70 I will be taking state hwys 24, then 95, then 276<br/>
to Bullfrog.  Then ferrying over to Halls Crossing and taking hwys<br/>
276, then 95, then 191 to Moab.  Then back to I-70 and home to Ogden.<br/>
 Anyone in Moab up for pie?  Newbie's treat!<br/>
