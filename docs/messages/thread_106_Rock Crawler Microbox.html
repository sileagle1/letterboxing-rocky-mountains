already knew where I thought the box should be, but it was not there, <br/>
so I checked a couple of other places and still did not find it.  If <br/>
anyone who has found it is in the area, can you double check and see <br/>

any help would be great!!<br/>

Terry, email me offlist if you want more help with the location of the box.<br/>

can.  I have a lot of printing to do for my trip!!  I will take you <br/>
up on your offer if I can not find it!!  I can not believe how many <br/>
people go there!!  I used to drive through there when I lived up in <br/>
Kittredge (near Evergreen) as it is a quick way to get around <br/>
Morrison and there was never anybody there except for concerts.  I <br/>
guess timing is everything and I have been going up there when I can <br/>
without the kidlet in order to get it!!  Oh, well!!  The things we'll <br/>
do for a box!!<br/>
