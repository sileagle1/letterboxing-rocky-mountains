Hello again to everyone.  As I sit here in our snow storm, I am <br/>
worrying about the man that is lost in the mountains while <br/>
snowshoeing with his wife and daughter and dog.  They were found, <br/>
but he is still lost.  You guys may all know this, but I make sure I <br/>
keep my hikers insurance up-to-date.  I buy mine at Walmart and it <br/>
is only a few dollars a year.  It would at least pay for them to <br/>
find me if I got lost while hiking around trying to find an elusive <br/>
letterbox!!!  I don't have a good sense of direction and usually do <br/>
not get off trails - but who knows?  <br/>

I tried to find out where to buy that one time and no one knew what I was talking about. Thanks.  <br/>

It's a Colorado thing.  It's called the Colorado Outdoor Recreation <br/>
Search and Rescue Card and it costs three bucks a year.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.state.co.us/searchandrescue/SARcard.htm<br/>
<br/>
 If you buy a hunting, fishing, or snowmobile license it is <br/>
automatically added on. This basically pays for SAR teams to be <br/>
staffed and supplied throughout the state. When someone is injured in <br/>
the backcountry the rescue is free to anyone with the card. Even <br/>
helicopter service. So, like PF said, it makes no sense to be on a <br/>
trail without one.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about Idaho, but I did talk to a SAR person in Utah once <br/>
that said they are funded through recreation tax dollars, so there is <br/>
no need to buy the card, rescues are still free. Each state has a <br/>
different way of funding these services and I think some states just <br/>
charge the person who is rescued.<br/>
