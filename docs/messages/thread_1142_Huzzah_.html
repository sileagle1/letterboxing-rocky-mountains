It was so great to meet up with everybody who made it to the realm on <br/>
Saturday! Elros, Dark Side of the Moon, and I were trying to push and <br/>
shove our way onto a table when Dred Peach and Cappy showed up. Soon <br/>
after, Ravenwolf, Sparkle Fairy, Little Raven, Samurai Stamper, and <br/>
Brother Raven showed up in full renaissance dress. With their help we <br/>
got that table and took no prisoners. By that time the letterboxing <br/>
stories started flying and news of new boxes, plans of new boxes and <br/>
the upcoming Grand Lake Gathering were the hot topics. We paused from <br/>
time to time to curse Mapsurfer and his evil Bard. Later, Tie Dye Girl <br/>
found Peach, Cappy and I daydreaming of Pirates and lost treasure and <br/>
it was great to meet up with her again after her trip through Europe.<br/>
<br/>
Unavoidably, I must join my real life now (already in progress).<br/>

Look for pictures posted by Dixie and I later this week!<br/>
