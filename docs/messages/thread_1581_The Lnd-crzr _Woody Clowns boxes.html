At some time today.. or tomorrow... I'm going to go ahead and list <br/>
Lnd's hobbit series on AQ, but without clues.  After I get them planted <br/>
I can edit the clues in, but you'll be able to go ahead and log them <br/>
now. These are the boxes that were in that big round leather chest <br/>
beside the event table.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll come and post a note when they're up.  Same with Woody Clown's two <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, go back to your regularly scheduled boxing programs!<br/>

I think these boxes are already lised (without clues) - they're <br/>
called the There and Back Again series (boxes #1 - #8).  I logged <br/>
them as found the other morning, and had a lovely email chat with Lnd-<br/>
crzr after that.  <br/>
<br/>
Dunno about the Woody Clowns boxes.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Might be easier to edit in clues after they're planted?  Just <br/>
offerin' my two cents.  Let us know if you list them again.<br/>

Hello you lucky scoundrals of CO.  Lnd-Crzr here in MO insanely jealous of the adventures you've all had at the hands of Es. <br/>
<br/>
It just dawned on me that some of you have been logging finds for my Hobbit series here in MO thinking that it was the Hobbit series I sent out to Es.  Don't know why it didn't dawn on me earlier.<br/>
<br/>
I believe Es will be posting them (the CO edition) soon, but still have me listed as owner, or some such technological hulla-ballo.  Anyway, for those who have sent such kind words...THANKS!  I love hearing tid-bits of folks adventures.<br/>
<br/>
Take care you lucky, LUCKY lot!<br/>
<br/>
Lnd-Crzr<br/>
