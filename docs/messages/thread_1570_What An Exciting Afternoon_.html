                    <div class="plaintext-content">PRE and FrontRangeHiker spent the weekend in my area, so it was a <br/>
perfect time to meet them.  I was so excited!  You see, I've met only a <br/>
precious few letterboxers (outside of my family!).  There was the <br/>
cranky family I met on the trail in 2004 (they wanted nothing to do <br/>
with us!), and the thrilling experience of hosting the Cabin Fever <br/>
Event in Oklahoma (2005) where I finally met about 15 fellow <br/>
letterboxers.  That was 3 years ago, and I've not met anybody since <br/>
(and none here in Colorado).<br/>
<br/>
You all know how it is to wonder about the person behind the trail <br/>
name.  Well, now was my chance to meet two of them.  Woo hoo!<br/>
<br/>
We met up in Carbondale at a lone picnic table in the yard of an old <br/>
historic schoolhouse.  I'd brought my clingy puppy (3 pound chihuahua <br/>
named Bean) who, immediately after dropping his leash, decided he'd <br/>
like to go for a swim behind my back.  I saw PRE jump, and when I <br/>
turned around I saw Bean looking stunned as he struggled to swim in <br/>
this little creek that was dragging him away!  Thanks to PRE's quick <br/>
reaction (she ran over, fell to the ground, and snatched him up), Bean <br/>
was soon safe in his mama's arms again, shivering in the 90 degree <br/>
heat.  Huh.  Larious.<br/>
<br/>
After that little ice-breaker, we went unloaded all our goodies on the <br/>
table and had a good ol' time exchanging.  There were two especially <br/>
exciting things that happened:  I got my very first (and second) <br/>
personal traveler(s), and FRH got her 100th EXCHANGE!!!  Congrats FRH!  <br/>
She was so excited; so cute!  We gabbed away as poor PRE's arm (that <br/>
was facing the sun) got redder and redder.  We had to break it up so <br/>
they could escape the sun and start the long drive home.<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank you both for all the new plants nearby, the updates, <br/>
the exchanges, and for switching up our HHs to refresh and replenish <br/>
our respective hostels.  I hoped to post a couple of pictures of our <br/>
mini, mini, mini-meet (including a soaked Bean being coddled by his <br/>
rescuer), but my computer swiped all the pics off my memory card - <br/>
ARGH!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reinvigorating my desire to letterbox!<br/>

Cameo...you should think about coming down to join us on Saturday.  <br/>
There won't be any hiking or anything more difficult than eating and <br/>

Are you the same Cameo that planted a series of 3 boxes in Yukon City<br/>
Park?  If so, I tried looking for them but didn't find any of them.  I<br/>
don't like to report an attempt until I give it more of a try, but<br/>
I'll be heading that way soon, and might have a chance to look again.<br/>
If not, never mind, there's plenty of us that once lived in OK &amp; now<br/>
reside in CO.<br/>
Glad to hear your interest in LB'ing is renewed.<br/>
