Dragon is one of the earliest letterboxers in WI, but his wife doesn't often<br>

What city/state will you be meeting him?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are meeting tomorrow in Boise, Idaho.  Naturally everyone in the Rocky Mountain Region knows that Boise is the hot spot to box (He!  He!)  All kidding aside we have been thrilled to meet quite a few boxers recently.  <br>
<br>
All you have to do it tell us you are coming and we will roll out the red carpet!  Heck, Capperpillar has even carved an event stamp for tomorrow (she is an amazing carver) and I have activated the Blair Witch boxes (or should I say they have activated themselves).  It just doesn't get much better than that.<br>
<br>
Time to feel the love in Boise!  <br>
