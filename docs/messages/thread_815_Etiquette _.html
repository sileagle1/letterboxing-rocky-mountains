Any letterbox is such a great find and a labor of a loved hobby that I <br>
am always thankful for what others have placed.  However, I feel that <br>
the most delightful finds are the ones that are hand carved.  I am <br>
sure this is a can of worms depending on who you ask.  <br>

But I'm sure you agree that this info should be kept in private <br>

stamp. (Or anything else, for that matter). <br>

y-nought, whose stamps are all hand-carved, for better or for worse.<br>

Thanks to everyone for you honest answers!<br>
<br>
Aljan...  whose stamps are all handcarved and wouldn't mind if anyone asked.  I guess that I should start adding that in my clues.<br>
You guys are the best!<br>

the ones I have found in UT and ID are hand carved. There was one in SLC <br>
that wasn't, but it was taken out in a snowstorm that took down half the <br>
trees a couple years ago. It has since been replaced I heard. I haven't <br>
found all of them in MT but the ones I have found were carved. In WY, most <br>
are as well, except for a bunch of ones around Cody/Wapiti, but those were <br>
done as a part of a school project and it was so fun for me to picture these <br>
school kids from this tiny school getting into teaching others about their <br>
town through letterboxing that I just loved those boxes still. My trip to <br>
Cody was the only time I wasn't fairly disappointed to find a store bought <br>
stamp. I haven't had the feeling it would be too sensitive with this group <br>
to ask about the stamps, but I think some on the main list would not like <br>
it. I think it would depend entirely on how you phrased the question.<br>
 Have fun!<br>
