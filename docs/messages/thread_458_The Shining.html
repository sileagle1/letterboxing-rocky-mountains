Before sending a note to the box owner for The Shining Letterbox, I<br>
looked at the letterboxing clues list at letterboxing.org.  It looks like<br>
she had taken off the message about it being "pulled for repairs."  I<br>
assume that she did that after I sent her a message back in November that<br>
it had been repaired and replaced.  Where did you get the information<br>
that it was still pulled for repairs?  Just curious...<br>

the message is gone.   AND, I found the box and put in my little stamp.  So, <br>
all is well and it just made my day.  Thanks for your concern.<br>
