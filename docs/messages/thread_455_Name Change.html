I think that your idea with Gus is wonderful. My hubby recently had <br>
me carve him a new personal stamp with a picture of his old girl <br>
(blue point healer/ausie mix named Sadie) on it because she is now <br>
blind and can't hear very well. She finally retired from our hikes <br>
because we kept losing her when we would change directions and she <br>
would keep going straight! Now she rules from an arm chair!<br>

Her stamp made its debut today in a few Colorado Springs boxes, <br>
including the newly placed Electric Springs box.<br>
<br>
And you're right, Dix, now I can think of the Bard all the time.  <br>
Wait a minute, I already DO think about the Bard all the time.<br>
<br>
JeLyBean, thinking about the Bard...<br>
