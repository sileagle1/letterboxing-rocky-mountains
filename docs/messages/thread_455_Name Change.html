I think that your idea with Gus is wonderful. My hubby recently had <br/>
me carve him a new personal stamp with a picture of his old girl <br/>
(blue point healer/ausie mix named Sadie) on it because she is now <br/>
blind and can't hear very well. She finally retired from our hikes <br/>
because we kept losing her when we would change directions and she <br/>
would keep going straight! Now she rules from an arm chair!<br/>

Her stamp made its debut today in a few Colorado Springs boxes, <br/>
including the newly placed Electric Springs box.<br/>

And you're right, Dix, now I can think of the Bard all the time.  <br/>
Wait a minute, I already DO think about the Bard all the time.<br/>

JeLyBean, thinking about the Bard...<br/>
