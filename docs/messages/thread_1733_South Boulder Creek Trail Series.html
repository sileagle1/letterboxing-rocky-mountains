                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just maintained the four boxes on South Boulder Creek that are posted on Atlas Quest by "Chica".  The one that went missing is, presumably, somewhere down the creek as the creek bank is moved considerably with all the rain this spring/summer. <br>
<br>
that said, it's replaced now.<br>
<br>
I am hoping others will plant along South Boulder Creek... the trail connects with Centennial Trail portion which has a box on it, and Autumn's Folly has planted one near the series as well (mentioned with her permission in my clue)... the trail is great, easy for kids and grownups alike, and (aside from some mosquitos), has great access from multiple trailheads... so plant away and consider this an invitation to mention those boxes already planted by Chica (that's me)!<br>
<br>
Thanks, <br>
Martha (Chica)<br>
