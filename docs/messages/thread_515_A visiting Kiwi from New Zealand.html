I had the pleasure of finding a camping spot in the Denver area for <br/>
a little kiwi visiting us from New Zealand.  Chaucey from Wellington <br/>
sent him over to meet us and will be posting the clues soon.  <br/>
I hope y'all will go out and pay him a visit and send a note to <br/>
Chaucey to say howdy and that her little bird is safe!<br/>

Es, off to visit a certain Mr. Carino<br/>

Hello!  <br/>
<br/>
The clues are all up and ready at LBNA and at Atlasquest.  Esmerelda <br/>
has done a very nice &amp; creative job of writing the clues.<br/>
Enjoy the search :-)<br/>
