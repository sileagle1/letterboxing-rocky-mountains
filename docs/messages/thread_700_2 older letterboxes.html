                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was wondering if someone can confirm something for me.  Before the new LBNA site was developed there was another, very similar LBNA site that also had clues, however not many in Colorado.  I noticed that there was a box called "Cherry Creek Letterbox" in the state park.  There was also another box that is not on the new site as well.  Can anyone confirm if these boxes are still in existance?<br>
