I found the Pony Express 80th Anniversary HH today at the Meaning of Life LB (which by the way is a beautiful hike with a spectacular view...thanks Eoghan!)<br/>
It is my first HH....woo hooo!!!!!<br/>
I didnt open it there and figured Id do my HH stamping at home and<br/>
when I placed it (possibly in the next few days).<br/>
I realized when I got it home that the original placer did not stamp<br/>
in the log where it was first placed/and the first finder didnt either (they only stamped their stamp in it.)  I looked on Silent Dougs site right now to<br/>
verify the HH Etiquette and this is what is says:<br/>
<br/>
Logging a Hitchhiker<br/>
Whenever you find a hitchhiker, you need to make sure to log the find in several places. <br/>
<br/>
  1.. Record the hitchhiker's stamp in your personal journal.<br/>
<br/>
  2.. Record your personal stamp in the hitchhiker's journal.<br/>
<br/>
  3.. Record the hitcherhiker's stamp in the host letterbox's journal (the letterbox where you leave the hitcher).<br/>
<br/>
  4.. Record the stamp of each host letterbox in the hitchhiker's journal.<br/>
Im quilty of #4....darn it.<br/>
So its just an fyi for us all here when placing and moving HH'ers.<br/>
I am kicking myself for not looking at the logbook when I found it (but it was 730pm and starting to get dark...I was alone...its a good excuse anyway!<br/>
<br/>
Look for it in a  LB near you soon!<br/>
