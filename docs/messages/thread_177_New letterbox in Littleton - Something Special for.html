this yesterday!  Since I don't see it here this morning, I will post <br>
again!<br>
<br>
I had this letterbox as a hybrid but have since archived it from <br>
gc.com.  It is now only available to letterboxers!  This is my first <br>
box in Colorado as I started the hobby back in Texas (2000).  Don't <br>
be too upset that the stamp is not hand carved!  It was a quick <br>
gesture of gratitude to my wonderful spouse and I wanted to hide it <br>
ASAP!  Looking forward to seeing all of your stamps in the logbook!<br>
<br>
Kid friendly, dog friendly.  Easy trial system.  Go to <br>
letterboxing.org to find the clues or paste the link and happy <br>
hunting!  Enjoy!<br>
