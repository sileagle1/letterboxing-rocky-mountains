<br>
Take old Zeb off your list to check on.  I just got a note from a <br>
family who just visited him at Grizzly Creek and found him alive, well, <br>
and in great condition.  They relieved him of a HH who has wintered <br>
with him in the canyon.  Good to know he had someone to spend the long <br>
cold days with.<br>
