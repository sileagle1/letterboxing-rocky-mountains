                    <div class="plaintext-content">We did enjoy the hike very much!  We also got to see (and hear) our <br/>
first rattlesnake, a nice fat three-footer that was just about one <br/>
step off the trail.  A friend in Denver later told me there has been <br/>
a lot of problems with rattlers up on the Dakota ridge lately.  <br/>
Being about an hour from the trailhead when we saw it, I was <br/>
inspired to update my first-aid kit and add a snakebite kit to it!<br/>
