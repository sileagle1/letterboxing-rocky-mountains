Welcome BoxTOPS-<br/>
<br/>
A while back we had to go to First Post Moderation because of all the <br/>
SPAM we were getting.<br/>
<br/>
So anyone who hasn't posted to this list before gets their message sent <br/>
to limbo until a moderator approves it. When the moderator sees that it <br/>
is indeed about letterboxing that person becomes an un-moderated member.<br/>
<br/>
That's the reason for the delay and the fact that the posts are out of <br/>
order.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for hanging in there. We LOVE new members.<br/>

I tend to add nothing but my phone dialing skills, pie baking and <br/>
stomping around the deck in a supportive manner to the clue solving <br/>
every year.  My giant pirate hat squeezes me brain and stifles me <br/>
thinkin' skills.  But I surely do enjoy watching the big brains around <br/>
here whirrr and click as they unravel the mystery!<br/>
<br/>
Yo ho, yo ho, a RMletterboxer's life for meeeee...<br/>
<br/>
Es, dusting off the deck chairs and stomping the deck<br/>
