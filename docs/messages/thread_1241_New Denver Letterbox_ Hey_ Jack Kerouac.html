work?  Ummm yep - it was a great lunchtime reason to get out!  <br/>
<br/>
I even went back with a friend after work to properly check out the <br/>
scroll and exhibit.  Amazing!  I'd heard on the news about Jack's <br/>
scroll being 120 feet but you gotta see it to believe it.  This <br/>
exhibit (and the wonderful 1st boxing effort by murmur :-) are MUST <br/>
SEES ya'll.<br/>
<br/>
I've been attempting to put my stealthiest boxing skills to work to do <br/>
a box for the new DAM (Denver Art Museum) wing (which I finally toured <br/>
last weekend).  It's a toughy for a hiding spot but I'm going to try <br/>
my best to place another box in this area for those venturing to <br/>
Denver.....along with others I'm working on....<br/>
<br/>
Really, make a point of doing the Hey, Jack Kerouac box!  Maybe stock <br/>
up on books to read on snow days while you're at it?<br/>

Thanks, everyone, for your nice comments about and interest in my <br/>
first letterbox!  (And thanks to pre for nabbing it so quickly!)  I <br/>
am still a newbie in terms of letterboxing and stamp carving - I <br/>
would probably not have planted so soon except for all of this snow <br/>
and the Jack Kerouac exhibit, which is really cool.<br/>
<br/>
The box will be at the library through the end of March.  I have not <br/>
decided what I will do with it after that.  <br/>
