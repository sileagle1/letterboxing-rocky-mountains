not matter - I enjoy the hunt and the hike!!  However, I do appreciate <br/>
the work some of you have put into your beautiful stamps and log books <br/>
and it gives me a "goal".  But...I'll just keep hunting whatever is <br/>
out there. For some reason, after I find one, I feel as if I have <br/>
accomplished something and even have evidence of it!!  Isn't this <br/>
crazy??   Puppypaws<br/>
