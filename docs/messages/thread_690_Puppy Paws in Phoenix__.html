I have always had a hard time leaving Colorado - I love it there.  I<br>
also had to rush to get all of those wonderful boxes before we moved!<br>
 :)  What a big change it will be for you.  I hope you get here before<br>
we leave (July or Aug).  Kat is right about boxing in the heat  -<br>
start early and end early! AZ is not on daylight savings time, so it<br>
is lighter earlier, which also helps (if only the traffic would<br>
cooperate, as well). Right now we are hitting record-breaking temps -<br>
110 today!  Please keep me posted on your move!<br>
