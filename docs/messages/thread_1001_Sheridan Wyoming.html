82801--It's Sheridan, Wyoming. The frisbee golf course is right behind <br>
Sheridan Hall, which is student housing.<br>
<br>
This just reinforces that I am looking in the right place. The problem <br>
is that I ran into a guy over there that has been sifting through it <br>
since yesterday afternoon. Trash cans, old fire grates, everything. <br>
Not to mention a few dozen other people walking around.<br>
<br>
My only hope is to act quickily on a more specific clue....sigh...I <br>
guess I had better just take the afternoon off.<br>

Latest clue = 17. A woodpecker may point the way. (A woodpecker was <br>
calling when I talked to the zealous treasure hunter.)<br>

Homemade art ... a woodpecker hole?  Woodpecker may point the way?  Could<br>
it be up on a tree embedded in bark somewhere ... maybe near the hole? <br>
Are there any carvings (like initials) on the trees around there ... that<br>
could be considered homemade art?<br>

do like Silent Wings woodpecker hole tho...can you see one from the <br>
