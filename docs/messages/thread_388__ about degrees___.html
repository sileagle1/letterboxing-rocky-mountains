Its 210 degrees from North which is 0 degrees (and also 360 degrees).  It doesnt matter which way you are facing...ultimately you will face 210 degrees. If you are not sure how to orienteer with a compass Im sure there are tutorials on the many web sites.<br/>

<br/>
Get a baseplate swivel type compass for letterboxing. To follow a bearing, say of 130 degrees, twist the housing so 130 lines up with the direction arrow on the base and hold it flat. Then turn your body so the red part of the needle lines up with the (usually) red arrow below the liquid in the housing. The direction arrow on the base now points the direction to go. <br/>
Rather than try to follow that arrow itself, find a distinct landmark in the exact direction it points, such as a mountain or distinct tree, and head for that landmark. This is less error prone and frees you to concentrate on pacing or other clue deciphering. When you reach the landmark, choose another in the direction of the arrow. <br/>
<br/>
One thing to consider is whether the bearing in the clue is based on magnetic or true north. If the bearing is based on true north, you will have to adjust the steps above to factor in the magnetic declination, which varies locally, usually in a range of 8 to 25 degrees in the 48 States. You will have to research the local declination before setting out. Most clue writers indicate whether their bearings are true or magnetic; if unspecified, I would assume magnetic bearings, as virtually all letterboxes that use bearings use magnetic bearings<br/>
