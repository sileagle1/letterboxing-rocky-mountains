Woo!!  There are a lot of stamps from you all in there!  Did you send <br/>
it around before you left, Bean, or did you all meet up and stamp?  <br/>
It was like running into old friends. <br/>
<br/>
I also tucked a Nessie into a nook on the shore of Loch Ness.  I'm <br/>
pretty sure I saw Nessie in the water, too.  Pirates love Nessie.  <br/>
Because.  Come on.  Water and castles and ships and monsters!<br/>

Pre.. I would hide that for you in a heartbeat but I'm leaving town <br/>
for Oregon soon.  And won't be back til December.  If you haven't <br/>
gotten it replaced by then I'll be happy to do it when I'm back!  <br/>
I've had a missing report on Grizzly Creek and really wanted to get <br/>
up to check before I left but it's not looking like I will.  I've got <br/>
to get the Mt. Doom boxes placed before I head out.<br/>
<br/>
The gathering looks awesome!  I wanna go next time!<br/>
<br/>
I just read that article and it was great!  Good job, Utah boxers!  <br/>
That is certainly one of the better boxing articles I've seen!  And, <br/>
speaking of Utah boxers, see you all soon on my cross country trek!  <br/>

<br/>
Es, If I recall correctly, (and I just turned 42 so I don't always <br/>
recall correctly) before I went I asked people if they wanted to send a <br/>
stamp or a HH along or something.  Kinda like a care package from US <br/>
letterboxers to Scotland letterboxers.  A few folks took me up on it <br/>
and sent signature stamps or HHs and stuff, and I sprinkled them around <br/>
a few boxes we found while there and of course the one I planted.  So, <br/>
if any of you others get a chance to wander around the misty rolling <br/>
hills of Scotland, you might find a little Colorado here and there.  <br/>
And now, it sounds like maybe even a little more than a little.<br/>
