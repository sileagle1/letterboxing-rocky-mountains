I was hiking around in the South Platte Park today (did not have my <br>
instructions to the box) and thought I would look at the Lizard <br>
box.  Could not find it and it seems like things in that area have <br>
been changed.  Does anyone know?  I am a volunteer for the park and <br>
I know one of the rangers was concerned with boxes being in <br>
sensative areas but I told him I thought they were all OK.  I don't <br>
want to ask the rangers any questions about this area yet because I <br>
don't want them to bring it to their attention.<br>

I am the placer of the Alchemist's Lizard. In fact, I just got an <br>
email yesterday saying someone found it this weekend, and it was just <br>
fine.<br>
<br>
Maybe here is what happened: The original Lizard was taken and we re-<br>
carved the stamp and re-placed the box. Now it is in a different <br>
place. Maybe that's why you couldn't find it? But as far as I am <br>
aware, it is happy in its little grotto where it now sits. Please let <br>
me know as you get more info on it. I wouldn't want it to be in a <br>
sensitive area. If you don't like where it is placed, we would be <br>
happy to move it to a better location.<br>
