&gt; Hi there!  I'm about to make my annual trek to the Denver area.  <br/>
Last <br/>
&gt; year was my first visit there as an official 'boxer.... and you <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; something like 85 feet of snow!  I did manage to find one box <br/>
between <br/>
&gt; blizzards.  I'm hoping this year will be much more "typical" and <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; good boxing conditions for me while I'm there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 Yep last year 85 feet was the "official keep ya from boxing" snow <br/>
count! :-)...and that was just for December....snort <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Also, I was wondering if anyone would like to meet up for some <br/>
&gt; exchanges and general BSings, maybe drinks or dinner? (I have <br/>
LTCs, <br/>
&gt; too, if anyone trades those) I'm thinking sometime between the <br/>
27th-<br/>
&gt; 29th?  I'm open to suggestions, but I thought that time frame <br/>
might <br/>
&gt; be best, let the hub-bub die down a little.  Let me know if you're <br/>

I have a bunch of time off from work then and would be up for <br/>
meeting if/when one of our Littleton folks wants to take up Hosting <br/>
Duties and suggest a specific place/time.  <br/>
