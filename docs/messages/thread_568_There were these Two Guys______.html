There were these two guys all right, with 2 dogs, and they were <br/>
camped out on the log next to box #2 of the "There Were These Two <br/>
Guys.... Letterbox" all afternoon. I love this new series by <br/>
Esmerelda. I found box #1, passed by box #2 "temporarily" because <br/>
there were so many people frisbee golfing nearby. Found #3, went <br/>
back to #2, only to find that two guys were setting up lunch and <br/>
fishing stuff on the log. Dohhhhh..... so sad I am, still not <br/>
knowing the whole story of "These Two Guys"! I won't get to find out <br/>
the whole story for another few weeks, when I'll try it again! <br/>
Thanks Es, another FUN box to be had by all!<br/>

Kat.. you know the punchline but not the middle of the joke! LOL  I <br/>
never thought the second one would be hard to get.. I thought #3 <br/>
would be the challenge.  Who knew?!<br/>
<br/>
Isn't it amazing how many people are down there frisbee golfing?!  <br/>
I'm all about learning how to frisbee golf now!  Skeetch and I <br/>
decided they all have their dogs with them in case the disc goes <br/>
into the river.  "Get it, boy!"  <br/>
<br/>
Es, wondering if her canaries will fetch<br/>

 LOL... I think you're right, but my dogs would watch it float down <br/>
the river and safely and annoyingly bark at it all the while keeping <br/>
their tooties dry.<br/>
