&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wednesday 7/18(not Tuesday as PREviously suggested)<br/>
&gt; 7 pm<br/>
&gt; At the park where Silver Eagle's Coors Beer box can<br/>
&gt; be found.<br/>
&gt; Here's the link to the clues<br/>
&gt; http://www.geocities.com/sileagle1/CO/Coorsbeer/<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please post here if "you're in" given this new info<br/>
&gt; so we know to <br/>
&gt; wait for you rather than leave the park for other<br/>
&gt; destinations before <br/>
&gt; you have arrived.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After we meet we can decide whether to grab<br/>
&gt; something to eat, or <br/>
&gt; perhaps do some boxing...we won't have a ton of<br/>
&gt; daylight left, but <br/>
&gt; there are a few possibilities.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll be the blonde (female) in the explorer's hat<br/>
&gt; driving a green <br/>
&gt; subaru with a dent on the front driver's side.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See ya'll then!<br/>
&gt; preboxed<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Will be taking notes on how to get summers off)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; , so could we plan on meeting on the 18th?  Sorry to<br/>
&gt; be such <br/>
&gt; &gt; a pain.   I hope we can hit a few boxes on the<br/>
&gt; monring of the 17th <br/>
&gt; &gt; and the morning of the 18th and then I think we<br/>
&gt; might spend one <br/>
&gt; full <br/>
&gt; &gt; day hunting on the 19th.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The time and location seem fine.  My traveling<br/>
&gt; campanion and I are <br/>
&gt; &gt; both excited about this trip and meeting up with<br/>
&gt; some of the CO <br/>
&gt; &gt; crew!  In fact it seems that LB may be consuming<br/>
&gt; more of our trip <br/>
&gt; &gt; than we origionaly planned.  But seeing as how<br/>
&gt; this is one of those <br/>
&gt; &gt; seat-of-our-pants roadtrips, we're game for<br/>
&gt; whatever comes our <br/>
&gt; way!  <br/>
&gt; &gt; It's GRAND having summers off!<br/>

<br/>
I believe we'll be boxing part of the day prior to meeting up and <br/>
then on the 19th we'll be boxin' all day.  Not certain when we're <br/>
heading down Pagosa/Durango way, but it seems that area needs a day <br/>
or two as well.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be driving the silver Dodge with MO plates!<br/>

We're in for the Meet and Greet on Wednesday evening! It will be worth  the <br/>
drive from the Springs to meet up with all of you. We will be the family in  <br/>
the dark blue minivan (I think we'll only have 3 of the 5 kids with us)  with CO <br/>
AF license plates. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, we are planning a trip to TX in 2 weeks if anyone has any HHs that  want <br/>
to hitch a ride to the Lone Star state :-)<br/>
<br/>
See you then,<br/>
TX AF Family<br/>
