you fine folks!<br>
<br>
I believe we'll be boxing part of the day prior to meeting up and <br>
then on the 19th we'll be boxin' all day.  Not certain when we're <br>
heading down Pagosa/Durango way, but it seems that area needs a day <br>
or two as well.<br>
<br>
We'll be driving the silver Dodge with MO plates!<br>

 <br>
We're in for the Meet and Greet on Wednesday evening! It will be worth  the <br>
drive from the Springs to meet up with all of you. We will be the family in  <br>
the dark blue minivan (I think we'll only have 3 of the 5 kids with us)  with CO <br>
AF license plates. <br>
 <br>
BTW, we are planning a trip to TX in 2 weeks if anyone has any HHs that  want <br>
to hitch a ride to the Lone Star state :-)<br>
 <br>
See you then,<br>
TX AF Family<br>
 <br>
