THE BLACK-FOOTED FERRET<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The rarest native mammal in the United States, the black-footed ferret is a<br>
short-legged, slender-bodied weasel. It measures just 1 1/2 feet (46 cm)<br>
nose to tail. This small carnivore once was widely distributed throughout<br>
the North American Great Plains from Alberta, Canada, south through the<br>
Rocky Mountains to the southwestern United States. The last wild<br>
black-footed ferrets were taken into captivity in 1987. Today, the ferrets<br>
have been reintroduced to a few limited areas in the state of Wyoming.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The black-footed ferret is a nocturnal prowler whose fate is closely tied to<br>
that of the prairie dog. The ferret eats ground squirrels, mice, birds, and<br>
insects. It lives in burrows dug by prairie dogs, which also are its primary<br>
prey. A colony of prairie dogs 100 to 148 acres in size is necessary to<br>
support one ferret.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Massive hunting and poisoning campaigns against the prairie dog, its main<br>
food source, caused the ferret to decline. The wholesale conversion of<br>
prairie to crop land further impacted the ferrets and their prey.<br>
<br>
The black-footed ferret was first officially recognized by the United States<br>
government as threatened in 1967 and was listed as endangered when the<br>
Endangered Species Act (ESA) was created in 1973.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After the black-footed ferret population was decimated by disease,<br>
biologists determined that the remaining wild ferrets were not a viable<br>
breeding population. The last 12 ferrets were captured and combined with 6<br>
ferrets already in captivity to bring the world total to 18 ferrets, all in<br>
captivity, in 1987.<br>
<br>
Captive breeding has been successful. Sufficient numbers of prairie dogs<br>
were born to allow reintroduction to be attempted after just a few years.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In 1991, the first reintroduction of 49 juvenile ferrets was completed.<br>
Careful monitoring showed that 12 percent of these ferrets were able to<br>
survive the winter. The discovery of two wild-born litters was a<br>
particularly good sign. A second group of 90 captive-bred ferrets was<br>
released in 1992. Follow-up indicates that survival may be about 25 percent.<br>
The majority of ferrets are lost to predation by coyotes. The objective of<br>
the recovery effort is to establish ten geographically distinct free-ranging<br>
populations totaling 1500 ferrets by the year 2010.<br>

DIRECTIONS FROM COLORADO SPRINGS:<br>
<br>
This trail is called Horsethief Falls.  From I-25, take US-24 west 18 miles<br>
to it's intersection with CO 67 in Woodland Park.  Take US 24/CO 67 south to<br>
Divide where the highways diverge.  Turn left (south) on CO 67 and go about<br>
9 miles to the summit of the pass.  The parking area is on the left, the<br>
closed Waters Tunnel marks the spot.  There is some parking on the right<br>
also.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NOTES:<br>
<br>
One pace = each time your left foot hits the ground<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Pace Calibration: At the parking lot, there is a sign with a map on it.<br>
Stand with your back to the map, facing the tunnel.  It took me 20 paces to<br>
reach the mouth of the tunnel where there is a door locked with a chain and<br>
padlock.<br>
