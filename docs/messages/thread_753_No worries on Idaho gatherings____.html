Keep the boxes coming (even though it is so frustrating when the <br/>
boxes go missing)<br/>

&gt; We wish we could go too!!!!  However, our vacations, which are <br/>
slated for<br/>
&gt; other places, just seem to line right up with these gatherings ... <br/>
Moab<br/>

ugly<br/>

&gt; Oh, how I WISH I could go fishing for 'boxers in Idaho. You people <br/>

&gt; Well, I expect to hear some good fish stories when it's over.<br/>
