I asked the past mayor of Silverton and he phoned the Fire Department <br/>
up there and asked them to look around for a date by the White Eyes <br/>
Gallery.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, they said they didn't see anything. I have a feeling <br/>
that they aren't being as tenacious as we would be and probably aren't <br/>
checking EVERY absolute possibility. But they did have a look and came <br/>
up empty handed. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your scavenger hunt.<br/>
