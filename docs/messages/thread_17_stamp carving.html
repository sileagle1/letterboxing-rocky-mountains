If there's a Michaels around, that's where I got some of my stuff, also Roberts, which I don't hear mentioned as often outside of this area.  If you can find the Speedball kit that doesn't come with carving material, I like that better.  It comes with a better handle and more blades, including the #1 blade that I use constantly for narrow cuts.  I don't think the #1 comes in the kit with the pink stuff.  If you can find it separately, buy it.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, since starting to use the PZcut in www.stampeaz.com I have never gone back to the pink stuff.  It is easy to buy online and inexpensive.  She is trusworthy, and I think it carves much better than the pink stuff.<br/>
<br/>
When I'm in the craft stores, I have only ever found Speedball stuff in larger stores, and it is always located with the erasers, pencils, and stamp rollers.  I've never found anything actually in a stamp section (ironic, isn't it?).  I actually discovered the speedball carving kits by accident.  I was looking for different erasers to try carving with.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

I'm trying!<br/>

No really, I've been following the main board thread about carving quite closely. I went to Michaels, explained that I wanted to make my own stamp. Let just say that NOTHING they sold me works. So, back to finding speedball.<br/>
<br/>
Any clues on where in CO carving materials are hidden? I was thinking about doing Hobby Lobby next. Their lines down here stink, so I usually avoid it except for major sales.<br/>

Try this address.  I suspect that the hyperlink won't go to both lines, so you will probably need to cut and paste.  I just followed a link to danielsmith.net and went to litho supplies (I think) and found the kits I was referring to by Speedball that I like better than the beginner kits in most craft stores.  Here's the exact reference.<br/>
