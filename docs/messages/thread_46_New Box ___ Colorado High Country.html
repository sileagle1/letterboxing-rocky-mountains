Clues<br>
~~ Dragons tell your ancient stories<br>
   Dragons sing your ancient songs<br>
   Dragons tell your ancient stories<br>
   So your wisdom can live on!<br>
       (from "Old Ones" by Edward Earl Bates)<br>
<br>
Directions:<br>
Take Hwy 285 West toward Bailey. Turn left onto Park County Road 68 <br>
(toward Wellington Lake). Follow this road about 9 miles to the <br>
trailhead parking area. There is a sign for Rolling Creek #663 and <br>
Colorado Trail #1776. Park here.<br>
<br>
To the Letterbox:<br>
Cross the street to the eastern trail marker for Colorado Trail <br>
#1776. Take a 5 minute or so leisurely walk. On your right you will <br>
find a 50' fallen tree. 10 paces at 230 degrees from the top of the <br>
tree you will locate another fallen log. The dragon's treasure is <br>
buried behind this log under a pile of rocks.<br>
<br>
Walking Distance: Not far at all<br>
Incline: About 3-400' right at the beginning <br>
Kid friendly: Sure, though strollers will be hard<br>
Shoes: I did it in sandals<br>
Time: 15 min or so<br>
<br>
Other Facts:<br>
If you have not been further up this road, I recommend the drive. <br>
About 2 miles up and past the Jefferson Co Outdoor Lab School is <br>
Wellington Lake. This is one of the most beautiful small lakes in <br>
Colorado. Shadowed by Castle Mountain, this serene and secluded spot <br>
is just exactly the terrain in which dragons must have lived in their <br>
day. <br>
