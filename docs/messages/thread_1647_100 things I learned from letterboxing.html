It occurred to me that we could probably do something similar with <br>
letterboxing.  The things you have "learned" do not need to be true, <br>
just funny and based on LB experiences.  For example:<br>
<br>
1.  Hitchhikers are always worth slowing down for, and you should <br>
often pick them up.<br>
2.  North is straight up.<br>
