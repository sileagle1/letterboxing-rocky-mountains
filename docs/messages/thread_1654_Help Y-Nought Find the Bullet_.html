                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, it is time once again for me to beg for help from our brilliant <br>
letterboxing team, For those of you who haven't seen me do this <br>
yet.....here is the deal:<br>
<br>
The Snowdown Silver Bullet is a treasure hunt that is part of our <br>
(Durango's) winter festival. The clues are broadcast over the radio <br>
starting on Monday, 5 each day, until it is found. The first clues <br>
are not so helpful, but they get better and better until Saturday <br>
afternoon when they basically announce where it is. The finder (Me!) <br>
gets a prize package worth a few hundred dollars and the helpers <br>
(You!) get to bask in the glow of eternal pride knowing that it was <br>
your superior letterboxing clue solving minds that got me there.<br>
<br>
Some years the Bullet is found by Wednesday and some years it goes <br>
through Saturday. The whole dang town is looking for it so there is <br>
some fierce competition. But two of the last few years this group has <br>
gotten me, literally, feet away from the prize, (DISCLAIMER-- the <br>
person you are helping, aka me, is a total dork and has been known to <br>
follow clues to the, how shall we say......wrong side of the bridge <br>
ito a rattlesnake!)<br>
<br>
So, without further adieu....the clues (with my comments in <br>
parentheses):<br>
<br>
1. The Snowdown Silver Bullet has been entombed, (The theme this year <br>
is Durango in Da Nile, so everthing is ancient Egyptian...if you go <br>
to the snowdaown website the poster has heiroglyphs on it, hmmmm).<br>
<br>
2. The Bullet is naturally preserved.<br>
<br>
3. Look for a slightly out of place sarcophagus.<br>
<br>
4. The pendulum has swung back to Snowdown time once again.<br>
<br>
5. You may have to contend with snow.<br>
<br>
6. The Bullet was enticed to this hidden spot.<br>
<br>
7. You will not need a ladder.<br>
<br>
8. You will not need a shovel.<br>
<br>
9. You could be looking right at it and still not see it.<br>
<br>
10. Do not take it apart, we have trained experts.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, I am open to suggestions, ideas, or further questions. I have a <br>
couple of ideas myself, but I think our strenght is in numbers, so <br>
I'll keep those to myself at first. Brainstorming is what we need. <br>
The more ideas I have to check up on, the more chances I'll have at <br>
getting on the right trail.<br>
<br>
Woot! It's ON!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Is this an actual tiny Silver Bullet or a Beer?  My brain storming is <br>
listed below with the clues.  I don't know the area at all or the <br>
event so I am shooting in the dark here literally.  Blackvelvetrav - <br>
Boise<br>
<br>
1. The Snowdown Silver Bullet has been entombed.  Could it be inside <br>
a clock, timepiece, or other mechanical device, robot or statue?<br>
<br>
2. The Bullet is naturally preserved.  It is not dressed up or <br>
embellished in any way.  Simple and natural but possible inside <br>
something else.<br>
<br>
3. Look for a slightly out of place sarcophagus.  This would be <br>
anything that you can see inside or around.<br>
<br>
4. The pendulum has swung back to Snowdown time once again.  There <br>
was a Roman theme in 2002.  Weren't the Romans around when the <br>
Egyptians were around too?  Is there anything left around from that <br>
event like a statue, float, framed poster, clock???<br>
<br>
5. You may have to contend with snow. - Ski Hill, Sledding Hill, Snow <br>
Shoe Trail, Nordic Ski Trail, ice rink, is the area covered with snow <br>
anyway.  This would lead me to guess the bullet is inside something <br>
but sitting outside.<br>
 <br>
6. The Bullet was enticed to this hidden spot.  Historical spot with <br>
either Western, Roman or Egyptian ties.  Could it be magnetized like <br>
my Hit and Run Boxes?  Have any old movies been made in the area that <br>
might be a tourist attraction?  Are there any movie or event props <br>
being used for decorations around town?  Outside a museum?<br>
<br>
7. You will not need a ladder.  It may be a bit high but within reach.<br>
<br>
8. You will not need a shovel.  It is not underground.<br>
<br>
9. You could be looking right at it and still not see it.  It blends <br>
in very well with its surroundings.  Maybe in with other metal items <br>
so it does not stand out.<br>
<br>
10. Do not take it apart, we have trained experts.  Don't take the <br>
item apart when you find the bullet.  Could it be in a locked box?  <br>
Antique telephone booth?<br>

A very, very, very, abstract thought on this one....<br>
<br>
Since the poster is wearing eyeglasses, could it be incased in signage at an eye-glass <br>
shop....thus the experts are....opticians???<br>
<br>
Well, I warned you it's abstract....just throwing everything out there!  Y, what is that on the <br>
top of the Spinx's head???<br>

Good Luck, Y!  We're cheering you on!<br>

The very first thing I thought of was ice.<br>
<br>
3. Look for a slightly out of place sarcophagus.<br>
I'm the first to admit, as Dixie and the Boxtops, among others have <br>
have said in the past, "pre has a thing about cemeteries".  It couldn't <br>
be that simple could it?<br>
<br>
6. The Bullet was enticed to this hidden spot.  I can't help notice the <br>
word "ice" is in the middle of "enticed"  Maybe it's just how I play <br>
with words...Otherwise, maybe they were asked/requeste to place it <br>
where it is?  On private property?  One of the sponsors?  Maybe?<br>

10. Do not take it apart, we have trained experts.  FRH's suggestion of <br>
something having to do with DSNGRR is very good.  Also <br>
school/education, of course ;-)<br>
Taking it apart seems to sort of imply that it's in something else?<br>

a "train" on display along with ladders and shovels in a kids play <br>
area. <br>
<br>
My other feeling is that it could be hidden around the ice skating <br>
rink. I love that "ice" is part of entice!<br>
<br>
To answer one of your questions.....the silver bullet is an engraved <br>
shiny fairly large (4" or so) object that is unmistakeably the <br>
bullet. Once, about three years ago, the bullet was actually in a <br>
post office box and the key was taped under a table in an outdoor <br>
restaurant. So it could be entombed in anything really.<br>

It's been kinda busy at work today and I have only one clue more to <br>
give you:<br>

11. The vented big mouth is there for a reason.<br>

I'll try to check a few things and get back with more clues this <br>

That picture is Tom Little, a well-liked morning DJ at an all-local <br>
radio station. And he IS the person who (along with an AL Coors exec) <br>
hides the Bullet every year and writes the clues. After Snowdown one <br>
year I wrote him a note saying how much I appreciated the time and <br>
thought he put into this town-wide treasure hunt. And I said I do a <br>
little thing called "letterboxing" so I understand how difficult it <br>
is. He responded saying it was awesome and rare to get a note like <br>
that -----he usually gets complaints about how obscure the clues are, <br>
(even if the Bullet was found early in the week(?!)). I think Tom <br>
does a lot for our town..he will probably be behind me announcing <br>
the cat-a-pult contest live.<br>
<br>
And now for more clues:<br>
<br>
12. A small v and a larger V.<br>
<br>
13. It's not hidden as far west as last year. (Doh! I never found out <br>
where that was!).<br>
<br>
14. There is a traffic light nearby.<br>
<br>
15. The Hank's the place for friends. (Henry's is a restaurant and <br>
theater in the Strater Hotel on Main).<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the help, you awesome letterboxing chums!<br>

Y, I just read on a google search that the letter V in heiroglyphics stands for horned <br>
viper...aren't those 2 horned vipers on the Sphynix's head in the poster!  And one is peering <br>
out between the words DA NILE!  And, one is smaller than the other!???<br>
<br>
Just a thought.....watch out around town for the vipers!<br>

Okay, I've been finally looking closer at the poster.....<br>
<br>
There is some shape like a drinking glass drawn around the larger Viper!  That's what I was <br>
referring to this morning...what the heck is that?  A viper "entombed" in a glass?<br>
<br>
Another oddity....<br>
<br>
When you look at the picture of the mountain behind SNOWDOWN, the left side is <br>
highlighted with a lighter color....why?  It give the illusion of a man's eyes grinning!<br>
<br>
One last crazy comment.  The sunglasses reflecting the mountains...could it be that where <br>
ever the location is that this is the sight you'd see from that location???  I also think the <br>
shadows on the mountains look like a 14!  But, of course, it would to a crazy lady!<br>

Night all....Sundown for Peach  :: c'mon, Y, find the bullet!::<br>
