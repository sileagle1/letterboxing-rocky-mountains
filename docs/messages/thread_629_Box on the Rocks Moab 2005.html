I just got home last night and have been reading all the posts and<br>
enjoying all the photos. Can you stand one more message about the<br>
gathering?  Of, course, you can!! I had such a fabulous time this past<br>
weekend +! So much fun to match names and faces and see all of your<br>
wonderful stamps. The exchange frenzy was a finely choreographed hoot!<br>
<br>
I added 17 Fs to my puny pre-event total and 23 Xs, which is way<br>
amazing since, where I live, I never thought I would get ANY of those.<br>
[Puppypaws and Kittylady, I seem to have missed your stamps!:-( ] The<br>
Moab/Y/Es crew have hidden such a plethora of Lbs for the rest of us<br>
to seek. And now there are even more thanks to the forsight of recent<br>
visitors. Thanks to those who played along with my attempt at the<br>
personal traveler game; I cherish your participation. I got one first<br>
find, Y's To the End of the World with its most incredible view (and<br>
climb). Woo hoo! <br>
<br>
While it is true that the hunts and rewards were splendid, the real<br>
treasures were the nutty people whom I count as new friends. It was<br>
such fun running into you on the trails: Ramdelt and Stubby at the<br>
beginning of Searching (fortuitous because I didn't get their stamps<br>
at the exchange); A-Bear, CW Sun Seeker, Cadenza and Alex at the top<br>
of Searching and Blackvelvetrav after her dash for coffee; Aljan and<br>
company when I went to re-stamp at CO River on Monday. <br>
<br>
I certainly am relieved to learn that all the ID and CO people made it<br>
safely home. CWSS, please check in soon. <br>
<br>
Now having met a bunch of you, I believe I can claim the title of<br>
OLDEST in the age war, which is ironic because I am also probably the<br>
NEWEST in this group to succomb to the Lbing fever. Surrounding myself<br>
with younger folks (younger either in years or spirit) has long been<br>
my stategy in the war against the clock. Thanks for sharing your<br>
letterboxing ideas and techniques with a newbie.<br>
<br>
Many, many thanks and praise go to Kat, Y-nought, Kennamtn and<br>
Rivergeek for your efforts and hospitality. Aspen, I loved the<br>
flowers! I still have many more magnificent canyons to hike and boxes<br>
to find around Moab. There will be return trips, for certain.<br>
<br>
And now, who/what/when/where will the gathering on the eastern side of<br>
the mountains be?<br>

Y and I have been kind of chatting about a possible gathering near <br>

Es, I detect a friendly challenge re: the age thing!  We can compare<br>
silver hairs at Ren Faire, after I figure out just where that is. <br>
Should I bring the Jolly Roger again?  Please, please, pleeeeeease<br>
don't make it July 21-24!!!  I have to be with my better half in Wash<br>
DC then.  He's the keynote speaker at a convention and, of course, I<br>
have to be there.  (I'm sooo proud of him!)  <br>
Your Westerns stamp and journal were absolutely marvelous.  I heard<br>
about them from several sources before I even set out.  Folks who know<br>
say ALL your boxes are that wonderful.  I can hardly wait to find<br>
more!  And I agree that the oldest boxers deserve the most pie - I had<br>
a piece (or was it 2?) for you in Moab - and another last night - I<br>
figured I hiked off the calories in advance last weekend.<br>
<br>
Looking on the CO map for RF,<br>

Whew! I just got back from my Moab/Colorado trip last night. <br>
Wow - so fun to catch up on all the posts and look at the pictures! <br>
Yes, it was a blast to meet my UT, CO & ID friends! Great boxin' <br>
there in Moab - thanks to all the placers. Thanks to Kat, Kennamtn, <br>
Rivergeek and Y-nought for great planning! The event stamp and boxes <br>
were fantastic! And good pie. . . I loved the chocolate one!<br>
<br>
Now I miss the nice cool weather there...it's 98 degrees here in <br>
Phoenix today. It was hard to miss not getting ALL of the Moab boxes, <br>
and now I have an excuse to go back! I picked up a few along the way <br>
in Arizona and Colorado too - Grand Junction and Ft. Collins.<br>
<br>
Each time A-Bear got out the carving stuff at midnight, it was <br>
irresistible not to join in! Then when Cadenza joined in the second <br>
night, it was just too fun. Blackvelvetrav and Lizman had the right <br>
idea . . . sleep! Jasmine says "woof" to Lizman. She likes her new <br>
buddy and thanks him for the walks!<br>
<br>
It's great fun to search for boxes with friends who share an <br>
appreciation of this hobby.<br>
<br>
It was really exciting to run into our fellow boxers on the trail <br>
(Dixie Peach & Cappy, Ramdelt & Stubby, BoxerLover and Cadenza) and <br>
in the restaurant (RavenWolf clan & Aljan Sundance clan)! Thanks to Y-<br>
Y-nought & boys for going with us on Portal trail. And it was fun to <br>
have Kat along on one of the hikes, too! I haven't gotten organized <br>
enough yet to come up with an actual count yet of box finds.<br>
<br>
After going back to Ticaboo and Searching on Mon. with A-Bear, <br>
Cadenza, Lizman, Blackvelvetrav, I was lucky enough to keep on boxin' <br>
Monday. with Cadenza and Boxerlover - what fun! <br>
<br>
Then I headed on to Colorado found: Commuting - Those Were the Days!, <br>
Big Fish (in the dark), Johnny Carino's (in the dark), Grand Valley, <br>
No Use, Big Thompson Flood, Fish Tales, Joseph Mason (in the dark), <br>
William Stover, and Auntie Stone. I attempted Grizzly Creek  - in the <br>
DARK, and I think I was in the right area, but got spooked while <br>
poking around.<br>
<br>
Puppy Paws: let me know if you make it to Phoenix!  :)<br>
<br>
Oh, and will Stubby the Toothslayer keep on boxin'? I think he will - <br>
it seemed natural for him - he'll have to keep us posted!<br>
<br>
I'll need more sleep before writing up the clues to my hidden boxes!<br>
Thank you all again.<br>
