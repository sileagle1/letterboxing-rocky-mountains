<br>
We went to check on our dear little series and update the clues <br>
(landscape has changed much since March with greenery) - so for any of <br>
you that have attempted Fire and Water they are still there....and the <br>
clues make better sense (and the boxes are now in Lock and Locks)  :-)<br>
<br>
Keep an eye out for another two that are on their way (I was going to <br>
hide them in NYC, but there was not a good spot that I was not <br>
concerned they would go missing from).  <br>
<br>
We will be at the Zoo on Father's Day, so we will replant Polar Bear <br>
then.<br>
<br>

P.S. What is going on with the Ren Fair boxing?<br>
