I don't know about the rest of you - but sometimes reading the <br>
hundreds of emails regarding New England letterboxes can be a bit <br>
intimidating.  <br>
<br>
So - I've created this list so that we can discuss letterboxes a bit <br>
closer to home, post news on missing boxes, or beg for help on <br>
clues.  <br>
<br>
At some point, I'd like to have a gathering of local/regional <br>
letterboxers for an exchange, and perhaps some stamp carving and <br>
boxing!  We have some great open spaces, parks, and forest areas that <br>
are just screaming for more boxes.<br>
<br>
Thanks for signing on -<br>
Cheers,<br>

By the way, we went over the July 4th weekend to find the Flying J <br>

was not in vain.<br>

Hmmm ... well that's terrible. That same person also planted the Cherry<br>
Creek Letterbox, which also went missing over the winter/spring.<br>
<br>
Her name is Missy - and I did invite her to join us on the list.<br>
I'm bummed that the box is gone.<br>
<br>
Thanks for joining the list, Dixie!<br>

great for me as I still have to find my first box.  I have been <br>
anxiously awaiting the time to go and get this done!!  A little hard <br>
to go and just do it with a 3 year old!!  Oh well, maybe she'll love <br>
it!!  I have been watching for boxes a little closer to home in <br>
Englewood, though the ones that are in the Metro area are close, <br>
the "hikes" seem to be a little more than I can handle.  I am hoping <br>
this is the activity that gets me moving and hopefully improve my <br>
health.  Please let me know what you guys think about the local boxes <br>
and maybe we can do a get-together.  Talk to ya'all soon!!<br>

Last weekend, I braved the heat and went in search of the (3) Plains <br>
Conservation Center boxes in Aurora.  These don't require any <br>
strenuous hiking, just flat surface walking, but one of them is about <br>
a mile each way.<br>
<br>
The others are much closer in.  Check those three boxes in Aurora - <br>
and bring the kids! <br>
