                    <div class="plaintext-content">Y-Nought, you wrote to me from my website and I almost responded before I <br/>
realized that it wouldn't reach you at the address. I'm posting this to the <br/>
group b/c I want their opinions too. I don't think there is anything in your <br/>
post you wouldn't want repeated. Obviously the thought I had for a future <br/>
gather is for down the road, not in the near future.<br/>
 I would so be up for meeting in SLC. I have a ton of boxes I haven't been <br/>
able to find there yet. We would have to coordinate times. I have a lot of <br/>
things this summer and I'm not sure I can make it clear over to CO just yet.<br/>
 A fun idea--that I think would work better next year--would also be to have <br/>
a Yellowstone gathering. We could use a cabin or camping somewhere like <br/>
Island Park, ID (which is right by West Yellowstone) and we could go around <br/>
to Yellowstone NP, Grand Teton NP, Jackson, Maybe even Cody or some of those <br/>
areas. The boxes are a bit more spread out than Moab since we aren't <br/>
supposed to have plants in the parks themselves, but just driving to the <br/>
different spots is great. I could also get planting more this summer and <br/>
have more around the areas. I think it would be a great excuse to head for <br/>
the hills. If we did that one, I think we should make it a weekend affair <br/>
and box around together and play a bit in the national parks. Plus, I <br/>
suspect we could draw out a few MT and WY boxers. There aren't tons of them <br/>
yet, but there are a few great ones.<br/>
 What think ye? I kept wondering about that possibility over the Moab <br/>
weekend. I would have such a blast playing in my territory and introducing <br/>
others to my neck of the woods. It's hard to not have fun up there. <br/>

&gt; Hi Cadenza,It was great to meet you at Box on the Rocks. It was even more <br/>
&gt; fun than I thought it would be! I know that there is some talk already of a <br/>
&gt; possible gathering in Colorado. But I think it would be fun to have one <br/>
&gt; somewhere around Salt Lake sometime. Then I would have an excuse (as if I <br/>
&gt; need one) to go and find some of those letterboxes. Just an <br/>
&gt; idea.....y-nought <br/>
