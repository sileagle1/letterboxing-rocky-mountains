Poe at Roxborough today and it looks like there is more to the <br>
Roxborough story than I previously told you.  When I was there this <br>
weekend, Heather wasn't aware that the volunteer worker only showed me <br>
part of the policy letter, not the whole thing.  The part I saw was <br>
the "background" section that said letterboxes were not permitted in <br>
the park.<br>
<br>
However, the NEXT page contains the current policy that says they are <br>
allowed with a permit!  Sorry to have misinformed you.  I have posted <br>
the entire policy letter in the files section, please read it if you <br>
are interested in placing a box in Roxborough, or even if you are <br>
planning on finding those already there.<br>
<br>
Happy 'Boxing,<br>
