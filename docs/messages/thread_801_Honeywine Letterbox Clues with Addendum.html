HONEYWINE LETTERBOX CLUES<br>
 <br>
I dont care for honey wine, <br>
But the view from there is mighty fine.<br>
 <br>
Down thirty four a treasure lies.  <br>
The evening sun may blind your eyes.<br>
 <br>
Silo one is painted blue.<br>
Silo green is number two.<br>
 <br>
Go a hundred yards beyond,<br>
Hang a right youll see a pond.<br>
 <br>
Three ponds lie within the dyke.<br>
Stroll around them if you like. <br>
 <br>
At middle pond theres something more<br>
Hidden near its eastern shore.<br>
 <br>
A young trio of cottonwoods stand<br>
Where the water meets the land.<br>
 <br>
Look beneath and youll discover<br>
A flattened rock that is a cover.<br>
 <br>
Covers what? You may wonder.<br>
Could it be?  Secret plunder?<br>
<br>
*************************************<br>
<br>
A few assumptions quickly made<br>
Will often keep you from your raid.<br>
<br>
Wineries will stub your toe,<br>
the starting point has none I know.<br>
<br>
And don't assume that thirty four<br>
Is the one by Loveland's shore.<br>
