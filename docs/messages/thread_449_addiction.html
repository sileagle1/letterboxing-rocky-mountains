I knew for sure I was addicted when this happened....a friend wants <br>
us to have lunch together.  I first check my "clues" to see what <br>
area to go for "lunch".  So, today we are lunching in Morrison and I <br>
may accidentally have to stop at a certain spot after we eat.  If <br>
the snow and/or mud is not too bad, I'll have to take a short walk.  <br>

That's a sure sign P.P. A similar thing happened when someone asked <br>
me where I was going on a road trip. I started naming my wish list of <br>
letterboxes. They said, "you know there are other things in life <br>
besides letterboxing". I just stared blankly, wondering what they <br>
could be talking about.<br>
<br>
y-nought,  wishing I was snooping around Morrison today.<br>

because there is a letterbox at the Stanley Hotel....but, it has been pulled <br>
for repair.  Rats!   I may start a new trend if it is not there - put <br>
something there anyway!!  I could stamp a little piece of paper to put <br>
inside the box when it returns - kind of like a "get well card" for the box. <br>
  Is this legal?  You know, I have had this happen several times - <br>
discovering the box was missing and it is so sad and I feel so let down.  <br>
So, just leave a little remembrance - like they do for people...maybe <br>
flowers!!!<br>

Well, I've heard that there ARE no rules... so my opinion is to go <br>
for it!!  How fun for the placer to get back and find a surprise <br>
waiting... that would be a hoot!  The only time I went snowshoeing I <br>
thought my heart was gonna explode outta my chest.  Which is never <br>
good.  Anyway, if I went to put a box back and found a get well note <br>
I'd think it was great. <br>
<br>
I hate not finding the box, too.  The worst one was when I drove to <br>
Moab and hiked back in to find one of Kat's... nowhere to be seen, <br>
although I found the rocks that had covered it pulled back.  After I <br>
got all the way back home I found out that someone from Lake Tahoe <br>
had been sitting nearby...doing a little art.. having a little <br>
lunch.. enjoying an afternoon in the sun by the water... with the <br>
box at her side!!! DOH!  It was back in it's hidey hole safe and <br>
sound the next day.  I wasn't a happy hiker but I got over it.  <br>
Sorta. LOL<br>

Such a bummer to go after a box and not find it.  Happened to me in CA when I was trying to explain to my Aunt what letterboxing is and then saying, well theoretically we would find a box here...frustrating.  We did find some other fun ones on that trip though. <br>
 <br>
 ...from she who went out snowshoeing to collect boughs to make Christmas wreaths for the palm tree surrounded CA realtive...  so beautiful and quiet.<br>
