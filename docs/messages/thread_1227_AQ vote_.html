I think this is the thread on the results, for anyone who's keeping <br>
score...(and yes I believe the voting is now closed...)<br>

I like the concept of blue diamonds, but personally, I'm seeing some <br>
on boxes I've found which don't "cut it" for me and so I'm currently <br>
in the whatever mode...we shall see as more folks vote.<br>
<br>
Now the Placer's Choice icon has some merit...to me, anyway.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my $.02, keep the change.<br>
