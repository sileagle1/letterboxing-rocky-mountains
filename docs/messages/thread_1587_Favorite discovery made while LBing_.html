amazing discoveries, one of which made me yell "STOP THE CAR!" just <br>
as we were giving up on a box.  No spoilers, though.  You know who <br>
you are.<br>
<br>
There was another series I did in Oklahoma in a nature center with <br>
some incredibly inventive hides, like letterbox compartments built <br>
almost undetectably into a bench, a bird blind, a fake tree stump, <br>
and one that was even underwater in a weighted, waterproof bag on the <br>
end of a chain attached to a bridge.<br>

Railway caves<br>
Frozen waterfalls over limestone caves<br>
The rennaisance Faire (yep, it was letterboxing that got me hooked on <br>
that!)<br>
Tadpole Ponds in the desert<br>
A secret canyon that is reached by a culvert<br>
Grand Mesa<br>
Disc Golf (yep, same as ren faires)<br>
Honeywine ponds<br>
The marshes of Cherry Creek<br>
The awesome hiking trails right in the suburbs south of Denver<br>
Where the wild animal calls led me.<br>
And one particularly special place where I didn't find the letterbox, <br>
but the ock arn was spectacular.<br>

But my absolute very very favorite discovery has been the people on <br>

I think my favorite boxes were those that had the clues woven into a story, and there are <br>
some in our group that are masters at it. I have two favorite story boxes: one is about a <br>
frozen dog, giant, and a witch, and the other is about aliens, ancient art, and the arboc.<br>
<br>
Another couple of favorites were found in a couple of different canyons right after a hard, <br>
quick thunderstorm, and the power of the waterfalls and flashflooding off the sandstone <br>
were too wonderfully incredible to put into words.<br>
<br>
One day we had a great time taking our 4-wheelers out to find a couple of different boxes <br>
dealing with dinosaurs.<br>
<br>
There are definitely places I wouldn't have gone or found without boxes, including some <br>
caverns in VA last summer, that were so fun to wander through. I love boxes that tell <br>
some history of certain places, and even though I have been to some spots before, I learn <br>
things about that spot that I didn't know before that box! Eeew, starting to babble, time to <br>
go!<br>

I was looking back over my stamps that I have in my book - I guess <br>
that's what got me thinking about discoveries - and the exchanges <br>

<br>
Much in the same way that I would not have taken a particular hike or <br>
discovered a special place if there had not been a box there, I would <br>
probably not have met the people I've exchanged with (and, in at least <br>
a few cases, become friends with) were it not for this common hobby.<br>

I didn't realize that you didn't climb Mt Doom until you wrote this.  <br>

I'm amazed at how many cool places I've found just in *planting* <br>
boxes.  I've lived in Colorado for more years than I can count but it <br>
wasn't until I started playing the game that I started seeing some of <br>
it's magical places.  And meeting some of it's most magical people.  <br>
<br>
I couldn't choose one special box or place.  But I, too, won't soon <br>
forget where the sounds of the animals led me, an incline railroad <br>
carried me, or a poetic ballad showed me.  Let alone all of those crazy <br>
cowboys lurking under rocks and bushes!  And, I must say....wandering <br>
the grounds of a cannon-blasted castle in Scotland and finding a Bean <br>
box there.. well.. come on.. that's just fun!  And let's  not forget <br>
just how lovely the weather is in Minsk this time of the year.  <br>

I will be headed there this year. <br>

just in awe of the amazing art that is stowed away in the letterboxes.  <br>
Seriously - the carving and craftsmanship in many cases is so good, <br>

Yes ... the art is my favorite discovery made while boxing.  <br>
