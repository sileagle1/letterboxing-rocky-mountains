Which two were missing - out of curiousity so the rest of us don't go <br/>
looking. =3<br/>
<br/>
I hate having to write to people to let them know that a box is <br/>
missing. It's really a bummer to have the logbook disappear.<br/>
<br/>
And the Litha Letterbox rises yet again! I am constantly amazed at <br/>
how that box seems to resurface. Autumn has good Karma... =3<br/>

    The box that was missing was San Juan River in New Mexico. I was <br/>
able to find two postcards with their team stamp and the box stamp <br/>
image on them caught in the rocks and shrubs where the box should <br/>
have been. So one will be sent back to them and the other will go in <br/>
my logbook. Chances are pretty good that we were the first to go <br/>
looking for that one. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The box that I couldn't find I'd rather not say. It is entirely <br/>
possible that someone else would go straight to it. Silver Eagle gave <br/>
me a hint on another box around here last year. I thought the clues <br/>
were extremely vague, but the log book had a lot of stamps. I'd say <br/>
that the problem was in my interpretation rather than the clues. Oh <br/>
well.<br/>
