family "game" of hide and seek looking everywhere around the vicinity <br/>
by way of checking up on this box.  I'm sorry to report that it <br/>
appears SSH's lovely CO Hairstreak box has gone missing.<br/>
<br/>
The 10+ foot log/tree trunk this box was hidden in is reported to now <br/>
be about 4 feet from where it used to be :-(<br/>

Thanks for your offer, as well, claudey but it looks like you won't <br/>
need to make the trip.<br/>
