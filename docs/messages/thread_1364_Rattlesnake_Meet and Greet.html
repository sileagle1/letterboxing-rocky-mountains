fanged and venomous keeper!  OH MY, so who was to know that was a nice<br>
summer den!  Everyone ... please, please be careful at any of the lower<br>
elevations, which may harbor rattlers.<br>
<br>
We've only done three boxes on that Lariat Loop (on Silent Wings' b-day),<br>
but look forward to getting back to it.  I think we'll be taking it<br>
slowly and enjoying all the cool sites!  Thanks PRE and FRH for all your<br>
work on the Loop!  <br>
<br>
As far as the Meet and Greet goes, it was good to see some old friends,<br>
make some new friends, and meet our talented Missouri visitors, who had<br>
really cool things to share!!!!  Thanks a lot everyone for gathering. <br>
We're glad we drove down for this!  We were really waffling about the<br>
drive down and late night, but the promise of an adventure clinched the<br>
deal.  No disappointment there!<br>

A HUGE thanks to Yoque and Silent Wings of the Catamount Carvers for <br>
rescuing the Lariat Loop Red box in conjunction with last night's <br>
mini-meet-and-greet in Golden. I can't thank you two enough!<br>
<br>
There was clandestine hiking. There were tongs. There was almost <br>
an "oh $%*#" moment when we were leaving the area - good thing that <br>
gate wasn't really locked... <br>
<br>
A great adventure in a beautiful area. Most importantly, a really <br>
great letterboxing story I know I'll be thinking about for a really <br>
long time! :-)<br>
<br>
The online clue sheet for the LL red box was updated as of this <br>
morning, 7/19/07. I'll be dropping by some key places on the loop <br>
to update the rattlesnake warnings after work today.<br>
<br>
Finders should still exercise extreme caution when hunting down this <br>
box!!!<br>
