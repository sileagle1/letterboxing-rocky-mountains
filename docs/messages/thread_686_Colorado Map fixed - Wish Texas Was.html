&gt; I asked Choi to work on the LBNA Colorado Map and he jumped right on <br/>
&gt; it. The letterboxes in Montezuma County are now listed with their <br/>
&gt; neighboring boxes. And the area on the map leads to the correct <br/>
clues.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was surprised too. But we are still a ways behind you in this <br/>
process. Choi basically put Montezuma County back on the western <br/>
slope and switched links on the map.<br/>
<br/>
I think we will be voting on the regions and put our requests in <br/>
right behind yours on their list of things to do.<br/>
<br/>
It strikes me that a lot of states may be ready to divide up more, <br/>
now that there are a lot more boxes out west.<br/>
