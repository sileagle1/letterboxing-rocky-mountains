our 1st Colorado RMLetterboxing Gathering was better!<br/>
<br/>
A recap for those that couldn't attend ...<br/>
<br/>
We met at the visitor's center for Roxborough State Park only to <br/>
discover that there isn't a picnic table ANYWHERE in the park.  <br/>
However, we had food and were not to be dissuaded from eating! So we <br/>
spread out on a bench, and did some meet &amp; greet, took photos and <br/>
such.<br/>
<br/>
Then we headed up the trail to the Fountain Valley Letterbox (planted <br/>
way back in '00 by the Drew Clan).  Up there at the overlook, we all <br/>
stamped into the box, passed around the American Pride HH (sent from <br/>
Buffy of the Travelin' Trouts) and made exchanges all around.  My <br/>
personal traveller made its debut, and our little event stamp will <br/>
soon be turned into a hitchhiker!<br/>
<br/>
Dixie was effervescent - bringing several friends with her that were <br/>
new to boxing --- Jill, Jim &amp; Cathy, and Laura (YaYa).  I think she's <br/>
trying to single-handedly convert everyone she knows to the hobby!  <br/>
Eoghan and his beautiful fiance' Pumpkin Princess were there, as were <br/>
Fiona &amp; Joe.  Lisa (Tie-Dye Gal) and her daughter Nicole came, and <br/>
the prize for longest distance travelled to get to the gathering goes <br/>
to Guara &amp; The Foreman (and hubby John) who drove all the way in from <br/>
Monument!  <br/>
<br/>
We all decided we can't wait to do it again, but we'll choose a park <br/>
that allows DAWGS next time!!  :)  <br/>
<br/>
Happy to have met everyone!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad to hear your 1st gathering was successful!  Wish I could<br/>
have been there since I have never been to an event (never<br/>
actually met other letterboxers outside immediate family) and<br/>
there aren't enough Texas Letterboxers yet to hold an event<br/>
here.  Maybe next time I head up that way I can meet some of<br/>
you then.<br/>
