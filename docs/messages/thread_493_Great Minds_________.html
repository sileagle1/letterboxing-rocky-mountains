How weird is this? I am also working a stamp with 4 pieces to find <br>
down in our wetlands.<br>
<br>
But, right now I'm in California again on the SLOWEST computer on the <br>
planet, (not complaining, happy to have it) and got rid of my boxing <br>
fever by finding 3 new boxes on the drive out here. The most fun box <br>
was one hidden in Del Taco at Barstow. People sitting all around and <br>
there was a box magnetized under the booth! Would have found another <br>
one at one of the old missions, but the mission was hit hard by an <br>
earthquake in October, too bad, it was soooo beautiful.<br>
<br>
Don't worry, Es, I'm actually trying to think of a place in Grand <br>
Junction to plant a box for you, but you know all the cool places and <br>
I don't!! But, there are a few new boxes in Moab, some harder than <br>
others and I have one more ready to plant next week when I get home!<br>

Kat (no snow here, but the rivers are overflowing)<br>
