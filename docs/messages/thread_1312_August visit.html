That's a great place and a great time of year. I have tentative plans <br/>
to be gone in the first part of August, but if they fall through I <br/>
would love to do an exchange.<br/>
<br/>
There are letterboxes on both sides of the pass, but not so many that <br/>
you couldn't get them all. Also, for the east side you might want to <br/>
look at the Del Norte boxes. And there are some boxes on the west side <br/>
in and around Pagosa Springs. A longish hike leads to a very early <br/>
Drewclan box by some waterfalls, if you have the better part of a day <br/>
to spend on one letterbox. The wild mushrooms are awesome on that trail <br/>
if you hit the timing right.<br/>
<br/>
If you get the chance to come as far as Durango you won't want to miss <br/>
the Animas Overlook letterboxes. There are six letterboxes all by <br/>
different placers on a small loop trail....very nice.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you have any more questions about anything in this neck <br/>
of the woods ....either here or at edwebbe@yahoo.com.<br/>
