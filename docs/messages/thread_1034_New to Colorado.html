  I've seen posts here and there about a gathering coming up soon.  Can't remember who's holding it - would someone remind me?  When is it?  Where is it?

  The Catamount Carvers are going to help me put on the gathering...  It is the third weekend in August in Grand Lake - not too far for you!  We will have a BBQ on that Saturday at my house.  There are a lot of boxes in the county to be had.  Mostly mine although there is one over in Winter Park planted by a team effort between myself, Dixie and Cappy and one by Silver Eagle here in town.  So, there are good letterboxing opportunities.  Plus there will be an event stamp and a chance to meet your fellows.<br>
<br>
  I am hoping to get over your way this summer to do some boxing.  The only one I have from over there is the Sprouting Rock box at Hanging Lake - a hike that just about killed me.  Nothing like being reminded how rediculously out of shape you are!<br>
   <br>
  Glad to have you,  Aljan<br>

the place to be in this region though for boxing.  Some of the rest of us<br>
are up in other states with no boxing buddies to leave boxes for us.<br>

I hope you will enjoy your association here with these wacky letterboxers.<br>
It would be great to meet you at a gather.  We tend to also end up having<br>
some smaller ones at other times in the year too.<br>

The Marble box is temporarily pulled after a dramatic rescue by the <br>
Catamount Carvers, but will be back when we can sail the pirate ship <br>
back up there this spring.  <br>
But there are several in Glenwood, Rifle, Grand Junction...and all <br>
those places are so excited to think they might get some new ones!  <br>
Woohoo!<br>

Es, nudging Cameo to be sure to remember to check the mystery box clues<br>

expect that some folks will come in on the 18th.  We also suspect that<br>
some people will stick around to box on Sunday, the 20th.  With the<br>
actual event, you are unlikely to get all the area boxes in one day! <br>
Having said that, I'm also hoping that some of you will be bringing a box<br>
to hide.  I know that Aljan would be tickled to have some boxes to<br>
find!!!!  Virtually all the area boxes are her boxes.<br>

  The event stamp idea has been knocking around in my head and taking shape.  It's gonna be a doozy!  ...I hope.  What is the concensus - my place will be open on Friday eve.  Do we want to have the Saturday BBQ at my house or would the town park be easier?  There is a playground there and such.  I am open to suggestions.<br>
   <br>
  And Aljan would indeed be tickled to have boxes to find!  I love boxes!<br>
