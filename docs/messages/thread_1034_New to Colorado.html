  I've seen posts here and there about a gathering coming up soon.  Can't remember who's holding it - would someone remind me?  When is it?  Where is it?

  The Catamount Carvers are going to help me put on the gathering...  It is the third weekend in August in Grand Lake - not too far for you!  We will have a BBQ on that Saturday at my house.  There are a lot of boxes in the county to be had.  Mostly mine although there is one over in Winter Park planted by a team effort between myself, Dixie and Cappy and one by Silver Eagle here in town.  So, there are good letterboxing opportunities.  Plus there will be an event stamp and a chance to meet your fellows.<br/>
<br/>
  I am hoping to get over your way this summer to do some boxing.  The only one I have from over there is the Sprouting Rock box at Hanging Lake - a hike that just about killed me.  Nothing like being reminded how rediculously out of shape you are!<br/>
<br/>
  Glad to have you,  Aljan<br/>

the place to be in this region though for boxing.  Some of the rest of us<br/>
are up in other states with no boxing buddies to leave boxes for us.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you will enjoy your association here with these wacky letterboxers.<br/>
It would be great to meet you at a gather.  We tend to also end up having<br/>
some smaller ones at other times in the year too.<br/>

You've set yourself down in good letterboxing territory. The community <br/>
here is fantastic! The people are very open and friendly. I'm sure you <br/>
will enjoy yourself.<br/>

We have a box planted just up the road from you a little bit outside <br/>

you, and neither is much of a walk!<br/>

The Marble box is temporarily pulled after a dramatic rescue by the <br/>
Catamount Carvers, but will be back when we can sail the pirate ship <br/>
back up there this spring.  <br/>
But there are several in Glenwood, Rifle, Grand Junction...and all <br/>
those places are so excited to think they might get some new ones!  <br/>
Woohoo!<br/>

Es, nudging Cameo to be sure to remember to check the mystery box clues<br/>

&gt; &gt; Welcome Cameo!<br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;   The Catamount Carvers are going to help me put on the <br/>
&gt; gathering...  It is the third weekend in August in Grand Lake - not <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; too far for you!  We will have a BBQ on that Saturday at my house.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are a lot of boxes in the county to be had.  Mostly mine <br/>
&gt; although there is one over in Winter Park planted by a team effort <br/>
&gt; between myself, Dixie and Cappy and one by Silver Eagle here in <br/>
&gt; town.  So, there are good letterboxing opportunities.  Plus there <br/>
&gt; will be an event stamp and a chance to meet your fellows.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   I am hoping to get over your way this summer to do some boxing.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only one I have from over there is the Sprouting Rock box at <br/>
&gt; Hanging Lake - a hike that just about killed me.  Nothing like being <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; reminded how rediculously out of shape you are!<br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Glad to have you,  Aljan<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Hello all!  My name is "Cameo."  I've been boxing since November <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2003 and absolutely love it!  Last April I finally got to meet some <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; others at our Cabin Fever Letterboxing Event in Oklahoma City.  <br/>
&gt; Although it was totally exhausting (and that was in low, flat <br/>
&gt; country <br/>
&gt; in mild weather) it was a BLAST!  <br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;   My husband (a resistor, but enjoys site-seeing, which <br/>
&gt; letterboxing takes you to many wonderful, otherwise unknown places) <br/>
&gt; and I moved up a couple of weeks ago to Carbondale, between Glenwood <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Springs and Aspen (you all probably already know that, hee hee).  <br/>
&gt; I'm <br/>
&gt; still "moving in," but thought I'd check out the LBNA site to search <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; for any clues of boxes close to home - none here in carbondale.  I <br/>
&gt; couldn't even find one of my favorites in Glenwood Springs - guess <br/>
&gt; it's gone :(  There are a few in Aspen, and one in Snowmass, so <br/>
&gt; that'll do me good for a little while.<br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Proposition:  Anyone feel like plantin' some boxes down highway <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 85?  I'd sure 'preciate it!  I'm also interested in some "easy" <br/>
&gt; boxes <br/>
&gt; (I have several autoimmune disorders that limits my hiking ability <br/>
&gt; and sun exposure).  <br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;   I've seen posts here and there about a gathering coming up soon. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Can't remember who's holding it - would someone remind me?  When is <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; it?  Where is it?  Will it just be a "get to know your fellow <br/>
&gt; letterboxers" weekend or a "there're letterboxes planted everywhere <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; around here" type of gather?  <br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Looking forward to meeting you on the trail and finding your <br/>

  The event stamp idea has been knocking around in my head and taking shape.  It's gonna be a doozy!  ...I hope.  What is the concensus - my place will be open on Friday eve.  Do we want to have the Saturday BBQ at my house or would the town park be easier?  There is a playground there and such.  I am open to suggestions.<br/>
