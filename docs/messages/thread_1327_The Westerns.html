The Westerns is indeed completely gone. The hole it was hidden in was <br/>
much bigger than last time I saw it. I wonder if critters moved in and <br/>
moved the box out where someone saw it and took it. Interestingly <br/>
enough, most of the rocks that were covering it were gone also. I'm so <br/>
sorry it's gone, it was a beauty! Sigh......<br/>

Well, dang it all, Es!  I was hoping for better news.  That was one of<br/>
the most beautiful stamps - and journals, too, complete with sepia ink<br/>
pad - that I've ever seen.  I just hate it when a lovely one like that<br/>
disappears with a nearly full log book.  I'm SO sorry!<br/>

But have no fear.. I'll replace it.  I'll just have to find another <br/>
spot since it looks like some animal likes that little hole I made <br/>
under there.  Gar...pirates don't like critters!<br/>
