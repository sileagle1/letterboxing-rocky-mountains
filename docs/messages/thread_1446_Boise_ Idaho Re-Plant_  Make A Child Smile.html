<br>
The stories of courageous kids that you'll read on this website will <br>
touch your heart. Here, kids with life threatening illnesses are <br>
featured monthly.<br>
<br>
We hope that each person or family that finds this box will log on to <br>
the site and mail a card to the Featured Kids (3) of the Month. You <br>
can also check out the Previous Kids section and send cards to kids, <br>
who have been featured in the past, they also look forward to <br>
receiving mail. Featured children are not the only ones who benefit <br>
from the mail. It touches the whole family! Even the children's young <br>
siblings end up receiving their own mail! Some kids are too young to <br>
really understand where the cards and gifts are coming from, but it <br>
makes their parents happy to know that strangers they never met, care <br>
about their child and are sending their love and support.<br>
<br>
Do not wait too long to send your cards or postcards because time is <br>
of the essence in these children's lives. Many of these children <br>
become angels at a very young age and cards may also be sent to help <br>
comfort their families.<br>
 <br>
Directions:  Locate the Park and Ride in Eagle that is at the <br>
intersection of State Street, River Side Drive and State HWY 44.<br>
<br>
Clues:  Enter the Park and Ride at the east entrance and park as <br>
close to the east as possiable.  To the east of your parking spot you <br>
will note a grass area with a waterfall of river rocks and a few <br>
larger boulders.  Three small steps from the sidewalk you will see a <br>
large flat boulder.  This boulder is to the north not the one to the <br>
south.  Hidden under this boulder consealed by river rocks you will <br>
find your hidden treasure.  Please re-hide well as this can be a busy <br>
corner.<br>
<br>
