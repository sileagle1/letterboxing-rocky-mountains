La Paloma and I just flew back from Taos and boy, are my brazos <br>

We didn't get anywhere close to all the letterboxes available. But <br>
we did find some great ones and had some incredible hikes.  We hit <br>
Red River in the off season and it seemed like we had that whole <br>
valley almost to ourselves. Plus, it had been a while since we had <br>
found a letterbox, so the enchantment was double. It also was funny <br>
because it seemed like we were following Rubberpeace and Rubber <br>
horno across the countryside.<br>
<br>
A big thanks to all the folks who have placed in that area, and a <br>
recommendation to anyone who is considering a trip there.<br>

Viva los rellenos!<br>

sorry you didn't get down our way as we have planted a bunch of new boxes and we <br>

I was happy to see your stamps in one of my logbooks last week...and <br>
then we saw your stamps in Taos...and in Red River......I think it's <br>
awesome how the Northern New Mexico scene has developed.<br>
<br>
Woot!<br>
