Ok... after having just read all the posts on geocaching and your responses to said (mine being very similar!) and having to explain to my co-worker who wants to know "what's so funny?" It still gives me smiles. We haven't 'boxed' in quite some time as life keeps getting in the way.... sigh, but if I find "stuff" in a letterbox, I take it out. I have been disappointed only a few times, thankfully. <br>
<br>
Also want to say Howdy to All! I have been trying to keep up with reading the posts but haven't had the gumption to actually particpate. Will try to do better.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the giggles! <br>
