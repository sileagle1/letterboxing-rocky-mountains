                    <div class="plaintext-content">The H-A's have taken another hit:  Lemony Letterbox was reported <br/>
missing (again).  For those of you who found the second incarnation, <br/>
the log it was under, which looked as though it hadn't been touched <br/>
in years before we came along, is now in the drainage area nearby, <br/>
along with just about every other piece of wood from the area.  No <br/>
sign of any part of the letterbox, though.<br/>
<br/>
I'm taking this better than I expected, in part because I'm getting <br/>
used to it, but also because we found another place to hide a <br/>
replacement and because I'm feeling like I can carve a better stamp <br/>
now than I did back when I did that one.  Also, we received good <br/>
news on "How's Your Aspen?" and two of our hitchhikers, one of which <br/>
is in Massachusetts.<br/>
<br/>
I've got stamps piling up, so I need to get out and hide some new <br/>
boxes, including two (soon three) replacements, an Elitch Gardens <br/>
box and one featuring a skeleton pirate known as Captain Scapula.  <br/>
Of course, I will post here whenever anything new goes out.<br/>

Elitch Gardens, my grandmother lived on 38th Yates and I took tapdance <br/>
in the old Trocadero as a young girl...Elitch Gardens...still alive in <br/>
many ol' Denverites minds!  Look forward to it and Pirate Scalpula!  <br/>

Scalpula comes in on???::<br/>
