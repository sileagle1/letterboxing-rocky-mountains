While I am glad Stubby will be an active participant in our crazy<br/>
hobby, I am so sorry about the possible bad outcome of his finger<br/>
accident.  Poor Stubby!  Hopefully he'll be able to adapt to slightly<br/>
different procedures in his dentistry.  <br/>
<br/>
Stubby, I am thinking of you and have confidence that things will work<br/>
out OK.<br/>
<br/>
Awaiting news after Wednesday's appt, <br/>
Boxer Lover<br/>

OH, NO!  STUBBY!  Maybe the "goo" is just your finger trying <br/>
to "glue" itself back together?  Maybe we can call you Mr. MaGOO??  <br/>
We love you Stubby!  Hang in there!  Hope to hear good things from <br/>
the doc on Weds!<br/>

What a sad fate to hear that our favorite tooth slayer is having <br/>
real "stubby" issues.  We will be thinking good thoughts for him!  As <br/>
much as he hiked, climbed, searched and hunted I just knew he would <br/>
find the passion of letterboxing that we all seem to be wrapped up <br/>
in.  Keep us posted on his medical results and options.  I am feeling <br/>
a hitchhiker may need to be carved and mailed in honor of his loss....<br/>

I'd like to add my best wishes for the Stubb-meister. I think he had <br/>
as much fun and enthusiasm as any of us at the Moab Fest and he was <br/>
just picking it up as he went along. I sure hope there is better news <br/>
ahead for him.<br/>
<br/>
And many happy finds for the Toothslayer.<br/>
