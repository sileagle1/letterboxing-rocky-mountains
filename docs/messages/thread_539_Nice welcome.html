Thanks, everyone, for the nice welcome! <br/>
<br/>
As luck would have it, my husband and I will be at Bullfrog in late<br/>
April. His motorcycling group is holding a rally there and he will<br/>
ride his cycle down. I don't ride myself, but can't turn down any kind<br/>
of trip, especially to some place I've never been. So I plan to drive<br/>
along with him, maybe pulling the camper for us to stay in - or we<br/>
might just "camp" in a motel. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, since we are unfamiliar with the area, I am kicking around an<br/>
idea of maybe taking a reconnoitering (sp) car trip down several weeks<br/>
before the rally so we can decide whether to camp or do the motel<br/>
thing. If the HH trying to get to IN is still around then, I could<br/>
bring it with me and place it in a LB. I could swing through Moab on<br/>
my way home.<br/>
<br/>
What's the deal about pie? I like pie, too, but I'm not much of a<br/>
cook.<br/>

You don't have to be able to make pie to enjoy it...just grab a fork <br/>
and be ready to dig in if we all ever get together. Woot!<br/>
<br/>
I don't remember how we got started talking about pie.. I think it <br/>
was JelyBean...he kept talking about it or something like that.  <br/>
Some of us like Swedish Fish, too.  And guys in kilts... no wait.. <br/>
that's just me.  <br/>

Hi Boxer Lover,<br/>
<br/>
If by "Bullfrog" you mean Bullfrog Marina at Lake Powell, then I <br/>
think your gonna have great fun, pie or no pie.<br/>
<br/>
There is a letterbox that is practically only boat accessible over <br/>
there. It's at Rainbow Bridge and was placed by Silver Eagle. I <br/>
haven't found it myself, but it's on my wish list.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd throw that out there in case you get a chance to <br/>
explore the lake.<br/>
<br/>

I think cabin fever is hitting all about this site! What a busy <br/>
bunch. I'm busy looking for cookbooks with pie recipes, because we <br/>
must and I say MUST all meet in April and the pies are on me! Hmmm, <br/>
maybe with some pretty little red swedish fish on top?<br/>
<br/>
When at Bullfrog, you could also take a little sidetrip to "The End <br/>
of the World" to which I'm going to drag Kennamtn. to this week, <br/>
snow or no snow, because she is leaving for New Zealand next week <br/>
for at least a month, and when she gets back, it will be river <br/>
season again and I'll never see her until fall, because our river <br/>
guides get maybe one day off a month during the season! Whew, I'm <br/>
outa breath after that sentence.<br/>
