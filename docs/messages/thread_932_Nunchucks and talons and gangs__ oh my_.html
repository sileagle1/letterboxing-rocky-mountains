So Saturday I'm sitting at DIA waiting for our flight again and who comes walking down to the same flight?  This same guy.  Not only that, but I sat looking at his wife thinking..."I know her from somewhere".  Now, to be honest, the last few times that I have been flying I have thought about Esmerelda and wondered if I would see her.  The crazy thing was, I thought this was her because I had seen the pictures of here at the festival get together.  When this nice guy came over to ask us if we needed help again (I think his name is Jim), I asked him where his family was from.  He said Centenial and then said Parker.  I had forgotten for the moment that Es had said that she had family in Parker but then I said that his wife looked so much like someone I know but she lives out near Grand Junction.  He then told me that his wife Kim grew up in Palisade.  Believe it of not folks but this great guy is Es's brother in law!  And I must say that Kim looks exactly like Es!  I believe that I even met Es's parents!  Can you believe that I actually recognized her family with only seeing her pictures from the gatherings?  WOW!<br>

It sounded like you have some nephews that have done some letterboxing?  I'm sure the next time that you hear from your family, they will tell you that they met Ramdelt.
