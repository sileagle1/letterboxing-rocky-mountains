headed for Rawlins.  Then on to West Yellowstone (never made it to<br>

went through Dinosaur National Monument, into Grand Junction (family<br>
time) and then back to Denver.<br>

Can you belive, we NEVER even got ONE box!  I am very disappointed...<br>
but I also know we were so short on time.  Oh well, once the kids are<br>
back in school maybe I will just have to take really LONG day trips!<br>
