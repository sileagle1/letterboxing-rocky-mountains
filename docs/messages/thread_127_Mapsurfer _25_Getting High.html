                    <div class="plaintext-content">Randy was in Colorado around the 4th of July for an orienteering <br>
competition.  I met him down in Colorado Springs and we did a few <br>
boxes together down there.  <br>
<br>
While we were walking (since none of the ones we did could really be <br>
called hiking) - I did pick his brain a bit.  All I got out of him on <br>
the Bard's Tale was that he thought his was the highest in <br>
elevation.  I told him there were several boxes that were really <br>
high - and all he would confirm was that his box was "above 11k feet"<br>
<br>
That said, he's really cryptic - so who knows.  He also told me he <br>
thought it would take someone about a year to DECIPHER the clues, and <br>
over a day to hike for them.<br>
<br>
*sigh*  I think we're all cursing the Mapsurfer at this point.  :)<br>
