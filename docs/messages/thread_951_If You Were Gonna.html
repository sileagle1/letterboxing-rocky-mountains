<br>
Two particularly good suggestions, though all have been....erm..<br>
<br>
GRATE!<br>
<br>
I do get the paper, but missed yesterday's and I have never heard of <br>
the Fromagerie!....must work in a visit when I get up that way next <br>
week!<br>
<br>
Keep suggestions coming if you got 'em.  I have next week off for fun <br>
(and Punny) projects (and writing up more of my road trip report)<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

I'm Cracker-ing myself up...often)<br>

In doing so, I even found a related food idea for a box less than a <br>

<br>
So, anyway I have a question....has anyone used sound either for <br>
your clues when placing a box, or had to listen to in order to find <br>
a box location?<br>
<br>
I found something really ...Grate ...online which would require the <br>
use of either Real Player or Windows Media Player and it would be <br>
necessary to listen to get part of the clues. (there isn't a print <br>
version I can find), but what's "in this sound" is IMHO, really <br>
worth it, and it really fits with the Homage to Fromage theme!<br>
<br>
What's your opinion on this idea of incorporating sound?  Especially <br>
about whether you think most boxers would actually be able to access <br>
it.  Or by using sound, would I basically be making my box <br>
inaccessible to some/many boxers?  <br>
<br>
I should mention, that at this point in my thinking, this box would <br>
have clues you'd have to work on in advance before you hit the road <br>
anyway, in addition to this sound idea.<br>
<br>
Thoughts?<br>
<br>
I really DO appreciate all the help and ideas!  Those of you willing <br>
to get into the punny-ness of all things cheesy for this relative <br>
newbie is very encouraging!  I hope I'll come up with something <br>
worthy of all your assistance.<br>
