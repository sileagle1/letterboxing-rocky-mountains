Two particularly good suggestions, though all have been....erm..<br/>

GRATE!<br/>
<br/>
I do get the paper, but missed yesterday's and I have never heard of <br/>
the Fromagerie!....must work in a visit when I get up that way next <br/>
week!<br/>

Keep suggestions coming if you got 'em.  I have next week off for fun <br/>
(and Punny) projects (and writing up more of my road trip report)<br/>

clue/location ideas you have all given me on this thread! :-) (and <br/>
I'm Cracker-ing myself up...often)<br/>

In doing so, I even found a related food idea for a box less than a <br/>
mile from my house... <br/>
<br/>
So, anyway I have a question....has anyone used sound either for <br/>
your clues when placing a box, or had to listen to in order to find <br/>
a box location?<br/>
<br/>
I found something really ...Grate ...online which would require the <br/>
use of either Real Player or Windows Media Player and it would be <br/>
necessary to listen to get part of the clues. (there isn't a print <br/>
version I can find), but what's "in this sound" is IMHO, really <br/>
worth it, and it really fits with the Homage to Fromage theme!<br/>
<br/>
What's your opinion on this idea of incorporating sound?  Especially <br/>
about whether you think most boxers would actually be able to access <br/>
it.  Or by using sound, would I basically be making my box <br/>
inaccessible to some/many boxers?  <br/>
<br/>
I should mention, that at this point in my thinking, this box would <br/>
have clues you'd have to work on in advance before you hit the road <br/>
anyway, in addition to this sound idea.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
I really DO appreciate all the help and ideas!  Those of you willing <br/>
to get into the punny-ness of all things cheesy for this relative <br/>
newbie is very encouraging!  I hope I'll come up with something <br/>
worthy of all your assistance.<br/>
