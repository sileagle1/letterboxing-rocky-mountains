enjoy an incredible evening. What an awesome spot in such a cute little town for a summer <br>

<br>
For those who are wavering about the gathering in August, hah, you had better come to it, <br>
because there was the slightest preview to be had last night. It promises to be THE party <br>
of the year and many creative hours have already been put into this shindig! WOW!<br>
<br>
I also came away with a newfound awe of the art of LTCing. There are truly some talented, <br>
fun, artists in our sport, and it has inspired me even more. Thanks everyone for getting <br>
me started on my collection.<br>

<br>
See now that's cool to hear you say (ok type) that. Thanks Kat!!<br>
<br>
I GET that you traditional boxers don't "get" LTCs and have no <br>
interest what so ever in them.  That's cool. Rock on, SPOR on, do <br>
your thing as you have been. And how many new folks have been putting <br>
something back for others to play with have there been lately here in <br>
the RM area?  I'm just asking!<br>
<br>
A few things I personally love about LTCs:<br>
<br>
a) Get to see, for as little as $.42, the work of folks from all over <br>
the country.<br>
<br>
b) Inspired by same.  Seriously inspired!<br>
<br>
c) IF I make one to contribute to a ring, I get to KEEP the stamp and <br>
have the option of placing as a traditional box.<br>
<br>
d) Something to do in winter with snow on ground, in addition to all <br>
the usual.<br>
<br>
e) and for me, personally,....currently into placing/putting as much  <br>
creativity and imagination into The Game as I can(as far as I get, so <br>
far, anyway) cause you know: Without Placers there is NO Game....<br>
<br>
I want my head twisted by both those things: Creativity and <br>
Imagination in the realm of traditional boxing, trust me!  THOSE are <br>
the folks I want to play with!  No offense, but those folks currently <br>
reside in other parts of the country.  Not exclusively of course, and <br>
yet....<br>
<br>
pre<br>
If you wish to consider that as gauntlet tossed, go right ahead.  If <br>
you wish to ignore pre, ditto.  I'd love to play, collaborate, make <br>
mischief, shake it up, etc/etal in any case and sure would love to <br>
hear from you! Really.<br>
<br>
I dunno nutting about all this KGB stuff, but KNOW that given the <br>
right time and place that saying **The Purple Penguin Flies with <br>
PREquent flier miles** WILL get ya a letterbox.  Many other things <br>
will too...<br>

Don't do guilt....boxes should be placed out of shear enjoyment of the art, not because <br>
you HAVE to, not everyone is a Monet, yet, they still enjoy his work...did he ask for <br>
paintings back from all those who were moved by his work?  I'm just asking!<br>

Without SEEKERS, there are no FINDERS to appreciate the PLACERS work, I'm just sayin'...<br>

So go play with them!  That's the fun of letterboxing, there is something for everyone, <br>
everywhere.  Maybe you should point your compass to other parts of the country, you <br>
sound a bit down on the RM region....PREsuicidal....I'm just sayin'<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Don't get me wrong. I think the LTC's are a wonderful art form and I plan to add mine to <br>
this artform. But I don't think they are so involved with letterboxing itself. To me, they are <br>
two completely different things, and as an artist and an outdoor enthusiast, they are both <br>
terrific and can be appreciated as such. <br>
<br>
As to the comment about people putting new boxes out there, if new boxes were <br>
constantly appearing everywhere, you would have quantity vs. quality and it would be just <br>
like in Connecticut where boxers are running into each other on the trails. To me, that <br>
sounds like a nightmare. I love the fact that boxes are an unexpected treat when they are <br>
planted, whether it is a Monet or an 'oops I tried'. There is not enough time in this fun <br>
lifetime to do all the things there are to do, and letterboxing is just one of so many things. <br>
And remember, nobody was born carving, it takes some practice and everyone I know has <br>
gotten better and better at it. My original stamps are probably a disappointment to some <br>
people, but it is fun to watch the progression of letterboxers and their styles.<br>
<br>
And by the way, an awful lot of the boxes I have found in other parts of the country <br>
contain storebought stamps and journals.<br>
