                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad you enjoyed it.  Yes this location can get busy, but at other <br>
times it's fine. (hence the warning in the clues).<br>
<br>
For anyone who, by chance, might have printed out the clues in the <br>
past few days, I've ever so slightly tweaked them based on a few <br>
comments I've received - so you might want to reprint.<br>
<br>
More LBs in/around Denver in the works :-)<br>
