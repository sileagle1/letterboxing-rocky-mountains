                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well folks....we got close again this year...but no Bullet for y.<br>
<br>
One of the guys that was searching the frisbee golf course since <br>
yesterday afternoon was checking a random tree for woodpecker holes. <br>
It seems he got discouraged and kicked a bread-loaf size rock that <br>
flew a few feet because it was a fake rock made of styrofoam and <br>
sand. He looked inside and found our beloved Bullet.<br>
<br>
With two more days of clues to go he admitted it was pure luck that <br>
he kicked that particular rock out of the thousands out there.<br>
<br>
In the radio interview he said that he started searching the course <br>
because he knew Cobra and Shark were frisbee golf disk companies.<br>
<br>
And JeLyBean, #13 was Hit the Polling Place, which refers to the <br>
fact that we don't have actual frisbee golf goals, they are just <br>
Poles put up and decorated with streamers that the golfers have to <br>
Hit.<br>
<br>
I thought the clues were really good this year; they even were <br>
making a play on the theme Disco Do It and Disk Golf.  I had a great <br>
time, mostly because I got to share this search with the TEAM. <br>
Thanks everybody.....we'll get it next year,<br>
<br>
y-nought, who can finally breathe deep and start thinking about some <br>
letterbox clues he's been working on.<br>

The prize this year was $250 cash and about $300 worth of gift <br>
certificates to restaurants, B&B's, an auto repair place, a coffe <br>
shop, etc... Not a bad reward for kicking the right rock!<br>
