<div>
One of the biggest perks is that you can log unlisted finds. For example - a box which has clues on LBNA, but that is not listed on AQ - today, you can log it! </div><div></div><div>Here's how (notes stolen from a post by Sarcasmo) : </div>
<div></div><div>You Record Find.  When the box comes up as not listed on AQ, you scroll down the page to add the box.  There will be drop-downs or prompts.  I haven't looked at it in a while and since I have a membership I'm not sure how it appears to those who don't.  Judging by the paper hat you sport, you have a membership so you should be able to add a non-AQ or other found box on hat day! :)</div>
