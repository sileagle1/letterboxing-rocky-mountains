pirate way, of course.  I look forward to meeting those of you who <br/>
can make it!<br/>
<br/>
Skeetch and I were able to do a way fun road trip last week.  We <br/>
zoomed over to Durango.. checked on Wings of Eagles, Denver Rio-<br/>
Grande and Olga Little (all dry and safe and boy was it fun to sit <br/>
and read the journals).  But, even more fun...<br/>
<br/>
We visited the Celtic Tree which is a wonderful letterbox.<br/>
Made a tour around Animas Overlook to visit all the new boxes.. too <br/>
fun!  Every city should have a place like that!<br/>
We had the honor of being the first finders of Feline Triskele.. <br/>
fabulous stamp and journal in a wonderful, just right location.<br/>
Then on down the road for French Ingots. <br/>
<br/>
The mountains are fabulous right now.. I must have said, 'Oooooh!' <br/>
127 thousand times.  How much more fun to add letterboxing to a <br/>
drive?<br/>
<br/>
Also.. I had a note from Puppypaws that Buffalo Bill Cody has gone <br/>
missing.  Way bummer.  I don't care about the stamp, but I'm so sad <br/>
to not be able to see all the stamps and notes in the journal.  But, <br/>
there you go.  I'll replace it all, move it to another spot in the <br/>
area and long live Buffalo Bill!<br/>
<br/>
And JB?  The buccaneers have great memories of the day we visited <br/>
Altitude Sickness.  I'm tickled to hear it's still alive and kicking!<br/>
<br/>
My friend, Miss Moon from NYC will be arriving here tomorrow for a <br/>
week of letterboxing hijinx and the eating of mass quantities of <br/>
pie. We'll be making a little road trip to Moab to eat pie with a <br/>
certain infamous letterboxer.  Woot!<br/>
<br/>
Missen the mast and swab the deck, life.. she is good!<br/>
