                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wondering if anyone on the list has gotten the Peninsula or <br>
Tenderfoot Mountain boxes up in the high country?  These boxes are a <br>
bit out of my way, but might be worth getting if I get up into the <br>
high country tomorrow.  <br>
<br>
Thought I would ask if anyone had any thoughts or advice on these <br>
boxes.  How far is the hike?  How long did it take?<br>
Are the boxes missing?  presumed missing?<br>
<br>
Anything is helpful - I have a dinner engagement tomorrow, and don't <br>
want to box up there if it means I will be late.  (mother in law, you <br>
know)<br>

Thanks,<br>

Peninsula box is short, easy hike that you can do in 20 <br>
minutes round trip after parking the car.  Tenderfoot is <br>
longer and uphill so might take you an hour round trip, <br>
depending on your speed, but has nice views.<br>

I really want to get out boxing though.  (I need a fix! hehe!)<br>
