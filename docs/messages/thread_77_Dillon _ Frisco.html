                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wondering if anyone on the list has gotten the Peninsula or <br/>
Tenderfoot Mountain boxes up in the high country?  These boxes are a <br/>
bit out of my way, but might be worth getting if I get up into the <br/>

<br/>
Thought I would ask if anyone had any thoughts or advice on these <br/>
boxes.  How far is the hike?  How long did it take?<br/>
Are the boxes missing?  presumed missing?<br/>
<br/>
Anything is helpful - I have a dinner engagement tomorrow, and don't <br/>
want to box up there if it means I will be late.  (mother in law, you <br/>
know)<br/>

Peninsula box is short, easy hike that you can do in 20 <br/>
minutes round trip after parking the car.  Tenderfoot is <br/>
longer and uphill so might take you an hour round trip, <br/>
depending on your speed, but has nice views.<br/>

I really want to get out boxing though.  (I need a fix! hehe!)<br/>
