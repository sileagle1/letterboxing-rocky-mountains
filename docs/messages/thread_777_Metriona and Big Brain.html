The Metriona Bicolor box has also been found.  Interesting coincidence.<br>
<br>
This is not to say, of course, that you have to find the Metriona box <br>
to find the clues for the Big Brain Box, quite the opposite.  But, you <br>
do have to find SOMEthing to find the clues for BBB.<br>
<br>
So get out there and letterbox, people!<br>
