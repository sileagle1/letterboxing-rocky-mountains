                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been thinking about a Rocky Mountain gather of some kind. I know some<br>
of you are already working on something, but wanted to throw this out there<br>
as an idea.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I was thinking a day-long event (maybe 10am to 4 pm) at the YMCA of the<br>
Rockies in Estes Park.  Probably a Saturday in September.  If people wanted<br>
to, they could come up before hand and stay at the Y (facilities range from<br>
wonderful private cabins, to dormitory-style rooms), or camp in nearby Rocky<br>
Mountain National Park or at any of a dozen or so RV parks in Estes.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I thought people could send boxes in advance of the event, and we could<br>
plant all over the valley, as well as doing a series at the Y itself.  And<br>
then on that full-day, we could have a few classes (basic carving, advanced<br>
carving, custom ink pads, codex logbooks, Postal Letterboxing 101, LTC 101 -<br>
just a few ideas, and, of course, we'd have to find folks willing to teach<br>
all the classes!).  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I'm sure we'd get some event boxes shipped in, and could create some, and<br>
also have time for meet-and-greet and exchanges, etc. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Plus, events/activities for kids during certain times of the day as well.<br>
And depending on interest, child-care so moms and dads can go boxing.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Then folks could also stay that night at the Y, or drive home, depending on<br>
their preferences.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Anyone interested?  I'm thinking Saturday, the 18th of September. (Labor Day<br>
is the 6th - so this would be two weekends later.)  Weigh-in on timing too.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Thanks for your feedback,  <br>

Before you get too far along on your planning, I know for a fact that TaiChi and ChiTea are thinking about some kind of event this summer and have heard 3rd hand that SeatleBoundandherAligator might be too, so I'd recommend touching base with them (if they don't pipe up here first)before you totally commit to going forward.<br>

OOOh, we would definitely be interested.... FYI - there is a great box at the top of a hill on the YMCA property that we hiked to last summer.  A very nice view and interesting experience.  Sounds like fun!<br>

We would love Estes Park - the Y is awesome (even though we almost got lost in a storm and probably would have ended up on the news - talk about embarrassing for a police employee/colorado native!!!!)  Looking forward to it!!! <br>

I've been thinking about a Rocky Mountain gather of some kind. I know some<br>
of you are already working on something, but wanted to throw this out there<br>
as an idea.<br>
<br>
I was thinking a day-long event (maybe 10am to 4 pm) at the YMCA of the<br>
Rockies in Estes Park. Probably a Saturday in September. If people wanted<br>
to, they could come up before hand and stay at the Y (facilities range from<br>
wonderful private cabins, to dormitory-style rooms), or camp in nearby Rocky<br>
Mountain National Park or at any of a dozen or so RV parks in Estes.<br>
<br>
I thought people could send boxes in advance of the event, and we could<br>
plant all over the valley, as well as doing a series at the Y itself. And<br>
then on that full-day, we could have a few classes (basic carving, advanced<br>
carving, custom ink pads, codex logbooks, Postal Letterboxing 101, LTC 101 -<br>
just a few ideas, and, of course, we'd have to find folks willing to teach<br>
all the classes!). <br>
<br>
I'm sure we'd get some event boxes shipped in, and could create some, and<br>
also have time for meet-and-greet and exchanges, etc. <br>
<br>
Plus, events/activities for kids during certain times of the day as well.<br>
And depending on interest, child-care so moms and dads can go boxing.<br>
<br>
Then folks could also stay that night at the Y, or drive home, depending on<br>
their preferences.<br>
<br>
Anyone interested? I'm thinking Saturday, the 18th of September. (Labor Day<br>
is the 6th - so this would be two weekends later.) Weigh-in on timing too.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your feedback, <br>
<br>
