<br/>
Went on a lovely little hike up the Mesa Trail to snag a box at 6:30AM <br/>
this morn.  I had to be in the office to start something at 6AM but <br/>
didn't need to hang around!!  It's a lovely hike but not stroller <br/>
friendly!  On the way down I saw 12 deer headed out to enjoy their <br/>
day.  Very cool.<br/>
<br/>
On a sadder note, I went boxing on Sunday with the intent of visiting a <br/>
Kiwi at the Cherry Creek Reservior.  Unfortunately, it appears that the <br/>
spring runoff might have carried him away.  We searched all over and <br/>
could not find him - much to the chagrin of my 6-year-old.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, Aljan, I would have looked for Bird and Berry but the link for the <br/>
clues points the the letterboxing homepage.  Hints? or could you email <br/>
them to me (say hi to Donnie and glad to see Maroon 5 was a blast!)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<br/>
M5 was indeed a blast.  Why isn't groupie an actual job?  *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
I kept meaning to tell you that I just finsihed up an INSANE stamp that I wanted to send you a print of as it is called "Phoenix Rising".  It has gone out to live in red rocked Moab but I think I have another print of it hanging around if you want me to send one to you.  Give me your address off list if you do.<br/>
