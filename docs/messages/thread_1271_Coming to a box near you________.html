boxes placed this spring/summer with clues included in each box to the <br>
final sleuth prize.  Obviously the larger number of boxes will be <br>
planted in my general area but I plan to have them in multiple <br>
counties (possibly the eastern slope and southern Colorado with some <br>
assistance).  I am open to any suggestions that anyone may have and <br>
hope that this will be as much fun as it was in the postal community.  <br>
Please let me know if you have any suggestions or comments.  Thank you!<br>

I remember seeing a couple of those stamps in Moab and being very <br>
intrigued with the whole mystery series idea. I'm looking forward to <br>
seeing this in it's new form.<br>
