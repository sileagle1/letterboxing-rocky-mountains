Hi, Colorado 'boxers.  I received approval yesterday from the JeffCo <br>
Open Space people for my stegosaurus box near Morrison, so I am <br>
officially publishing the clues:<br>
<br>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?<br>
boxnum=11280&boxname=SoC_#5:_Stegosaurus<br>
<br>
They asked me if the box was in place, and I told them it was but I <br>
was waiting to publish it until I got approval.  They wanted to go <br>
out and look at the spot to approve it.  I then asked them, "if it <br>
hadn't been in place, and I didn't have a specific spot picked out <br>
yet, how would you know whether to approve it?"<br>
<br>
Their answer: "I don't know, we were thinking you might be the first <br>
one like that..."<br>
<br>
Happy 'Boxing<br>

Swimming In Opposite Directions.  While we were there, we found a new<br>
place to hide it, but because of the rules, we took the box with us.  I<br>
submited the appliation and got an email a few days later that they<br>
thought they were in the right place, but the box wasn't there.  I<br>
emailed back explaining that the box wasn't planted because we were told<br>
we needed approval first.  The ranger was quite confused.<br>
