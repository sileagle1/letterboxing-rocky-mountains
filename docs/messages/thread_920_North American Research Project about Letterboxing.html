I am currently working on a Master's in Big Brain Boxology. But I'm <br>

The joy of it all is that you don't even need to go back to school!  We<br>
can provide you with a Doctorate of Letterboxing diploma from the rather<br>
exclusive Catamount Academy in exchange for certain unpublished clues to<br>
a particular letterbox.<br>

It does sound bizarre to some people when I tell them I am doing doctoral research on letterboxing.  After they realize that I am not talking about a video format, they become curious about the hobby/activity/sport/obsession. Ever since I got started in 2000 I have been fascinated by why people participate.  In the summer of 2004 I spent a week in Dartmoor where it all began - it is so different in the UK.  In typical fashion, Americans have made major changes in letterboxing.  But it is all good. And I want to write this and lots more looking at why and how people participate in this great culture!

Marisa, I think what you are doing is great, I didn't mean to imply <br>
otherwise, and I hope you didn't take it that way.  I was just so <br>
very excited that someone had actually found a way to work <br>
letterboxing into their profession.  My own dream is to one day <br>
become a full-time professional letterboxer, and find a way for <br>
letterboxing to actually put food on my table.  I mean, other than <br>
pie--it already does that.<br>
<br>
In case you haven't already done so, a couple of other places to <br>
post your request would be the national talk list <br>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/) and Atlas Quest <br>
(http://www.atlasquest.com/).<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>
JeLyBean<br>
