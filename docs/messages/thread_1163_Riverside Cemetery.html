NEW location and new CLUES (box has more limited access than before): <br>

<br>
It's one of my earlier boxes, but I'm still very proud of this stamp <br>
and the research that went into this box.<br>
<br>
Heck Halloween isn't all that far away.  Maybe I'll do the 3rd in the <br>
series sometime soon ...<br>

<who found out the construction where the box used to be is supposed t <br>
continue for another 1.5 years!><br>
