I'm astounded at the growth of letterboxing in our Rocky Mountain <br>
region, and particularly this list.  I can remember being excited <br>
when we had a whopping twelve folks here.  I can remember also our <br>
first little gathering at Roxborough Park at the Fountain Valley <br>
box.  What a little group we were back then!  (photos still in the <br>
photos section on the board)<br>
<br>
It's exciting to see new boxes being planted, and hitch hikers from <br>
across the country making their way as well.  It also got me to <br>
thinking about the fact that we haven't had a gathering in quite <br>
awhile.  Didn't manage to line one up this summer.  <br>
<br>
Would anyone be willing to suggest a location with a box or two, <br>
where we could meet and exchange stamps and get a box together as a <br>
group?<br>

We would love to make it to a fall gathering. We missed the last <br>
one, and were oh-so-bummed!<br>
<br>
I like castlewood canyon, however, in case of inclement weather, we <br>
may want to consider somewhere we could flee to the indoors in case <br>
we picked a day that ended up very cold.<br>
<br>
Thanks to the Treasure Finders, there are several very nice boxes in <br>
the Littleton/Golden area, and I'm sure we could find a nice meeting <br>
spot.<br>
<br>
I don't know about anyone else, but our group also doesn't have ANY <br>
boxes from the Ft. Collins area - that could be a nice change of <br>
scenery. Anyone from up in that general direction have any <br>
suggestions?<br>
