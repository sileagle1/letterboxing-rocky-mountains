  Hello All-<br/>
<br/>
This is a bit embarrassing for me. I was showing the clues to <br/>
Thundering Horse of Jove to a newbie the other day. As I looked down <br/>
the list I noticed that my favorite clue didn't make it into the <br/>
final draft. I have added it to the LBNA site, but I thought I should <br/>
announce it here in case anyone had printed it out. <br/>
<br/>
The clue is:    Head for Pagasus Allan <br/>
and it goes right before   Pass Pale Edge Dwelling<br/>
in case you want to just write it on your sheet and save some printer <br/>
ink.<br/>
<br/>
I should also say that at least one person, JeLyBean, has solved this <br/>
mystery without that clue, which I think is pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'll try to proofread better next time and avoid the changing <br/>
clue syndrome.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, <br/>
y-nought <br/>
