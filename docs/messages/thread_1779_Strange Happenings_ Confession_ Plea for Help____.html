<br>
The strangest thing happened to me yesterday.......I read a cryptic posting from PRE and I think I UNDERSTOOD it!  I know!...It's freaking me out too!<br>
<br>
But truthfully, I can't be SURE I understood it but it did remind me that, even though I was warned, and then reminded, I let the Geocities site go down without doing anything about the Onion II clues.<br>
<br>
So that's the confession and yesterday I went through my computers at work and at home and I don't have an electronic copy of those clues.  So then I checked in "The Big Box of Letterboxing Clues and Memorabilia that I Will Never Throw Away" and I found three copies of Onion Clues with some notes on ciphering and deciphering....but these were the Old Onion that got destroyed by the Jeffco guys and not the new one after I replaced it. It actually makes sense because I wrote those clues on vacation and probably tossed my notes once I posted them on Geocities.<br>
<br>
So...my plea is....is anybody out there crazy enough to have kept a copy of the Onion II clues?  I don't even need the ciphered version because I can do that from here.  Basically I need the directions to the box so that I don't need to drive back up to the Front Range and count steps and take a compass reading.<br>
<br>
If anyone does, bless you.  If nobody does I will need to archive that box until I have a chance to get back up there, (which shouldn't be too long).<br>
<br>
Thanks for indulging an old fool.<br>

Ha!  Hahahah!  Snort TM :-)And yay!<br>
<br>
Do be sure to write down this date!  Oh and while we're at it perhaps the date of my original message....Springtime tends to bring out foolishness and the odd PREsent once in awhile. After we've all been hibernating over winter sometimes a reminder that the Game is still here can prove, um, useful.<br>
<br>
I think I might have those Onion clues at home, as well.  Lemme know if know if you need my help.  Onions still make me cry, though.  Among other things, they can remind me not to make things harder than they are.<br>

Just sayin'...<br>
