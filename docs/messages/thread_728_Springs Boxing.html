                    <div class="plaintext-content">So Saturday I was supposed to do a craft show/barbecue in <br>
Johnstown...left home at 430am to get there at 6am to set up.<br>
Waited for the rain to stop...and waited ....and waited....by 10 am<br>
they cancelled for the day.  So we go for breakfast at a cute cafe<br>
then drive home in the rain.  I get home at 1ish/take my daughter to <br>
get her hair cut..  All the time thinking...I could go to the springs <br>
to find some boxes...  Well its not raining here...yet...or in the <br>
springs.  So I leave at 230 and see how many I can get in before it<br>
gets dark/or rains.  I lucked out...it threatened but really no more <br>
than a few sprinkles.  First went for Lark Bunting--what a great view <br>
from this box.  Then on to Chantress-what a gem of a park in a <br>
residential area.  Then to Pulpit rock.  I  get there at 630 or so <br>
and JelyBean says its less than a mile so no problem to make it <br>
before the sun sets.  Longest mile Ive ever walked.....  I think he <br>
took a helicopter!! lol...  It was great ......beautiful hike/and <br>
great stamp.<br>
I thought about watching the sunset from there but then Id probably <br>
stumble back in the dusk.  I did get back just as the sun was setting.<br>
Gotta love that croc!!!<br>
<br>
Did I mention I had 2 hours sleep the night before?  I think we all<br>
need intervention!  Lets see this sunday Ill be done with my <br>
committments at 1pm (trail cleaning at Lory SP)---how many boxes can <br>
I find before sunset?  <br>
<br>
Sorry Kathy I didnt call before going to the springs you but it was <br>
sort of impromptu....<br>
<br>
So many boxes...so little time...<br>
