                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I did go by the Ore House on my way to work, after being hailed <br>
by the Splendid Buccaneer about these great ideas.<br>
<br>
I looked high and low....in the mailbox,.....around in the alley <br>
behind the Ore House....but I couldn't find anything to dig or pull <br>
or look behind (except the mailbox).<br>
<br>
But I do think you're onto something because it's probably hidden <br>
somewhere that goes with the theme, and "pirates gold" works well <br>
with Ore. Another interesting thing I noticed this morning is that <br>
Wild Horse Saloon is next to the Ore House (neigh).<br>
<br>
Two more clues:<br>
<br>
5) You are being watched. (This could mean the web-cam that is at <br>
College and Main, although there is another one run by CDOT at 550 <br>
and 160 by the Doubletree Inn that is on the south side of town).<br>
<br>
6) The treasure you seek is not in plain sight. <br>
<br>
So, I think we have a few good leads. Unfortunately, I need to work <br>
now. I'll probably miss the next clue and won't be able to hear it <br>
until the recap tonight at 6:45, but I'll definitely be checking back <br>
here and poking around downtown after work.<br>
<br>
Oh, also, I picked up a Chamber of Commerce map and looked behind <br>
it.....mostly advertisements and a little history of the town.<br>
<br>
And just for the record.......I'm having a BLAST,<br>
thanks everybody,<br>

You bet I'm looking for an X!<br>
<br>
And PRE- I think there is a map by the CDOT cam. I picked up the <br>
Chamber of Commerce map to look behind it, but I didn't think of a <br>
BIG outdoor map. I'll check that out after work with my second mate, <br>
Elros.<br>
<br>
For the record, I was not awoken by Es this morning, but had already <br>
set sail for town when she called. It is my custom to leave well <br>
ahead of time so I had plenty of time to stop by the Ore house. I do <br>
admit that work is REALLY getting in the way. I've asked for Friday <br>
off.....but the treasure was found on Thursday last year (yikes!). <br>
And we are expecting snow which I will have to plow no matter what.<br>
<br>
I did manage to get the last two clues, however:<br>
<br>
7) A New German directs you to look to the sunrise. (New Germany is a <br>
town in Minnesota----Minnesota Vikings? I don't know of any Germans <br>
or Vikings pointing east in town).<br>
<br>
8) You'll find it at a lower altitude than last year. (That could <br>
mean about anywhere in town, because the disc golf course is on the <br>
mesa with the College above town).<br>
<br>
Woot! I can see you all have a pirate's heart!<br>
<br>
y-nought<br>
P.S. It will be interesting to see written versions of these clues <br>
online---it almost sounded like they said "a number between SHOE and <br>
nay".<br>

Does Neuer Deutscher (or some similar conjugation?) and/or mennonites <br>
do anything for you, Y as far as local info/places?  Isn't Minnesota <br>
known for mennonites?  I did a google on New German and Durango and <br>
found this.  http://tinyurl.com/2gww6o<br>
<br>
My own German ancestry would point east (to western PA in my case) <br>
which is what going in this thought-direction.<br>
<br>
I know the site is re: current Mexico...but with Colorado (esp <br>
SW)/Mexico history....well old colony/new/pirates/exploration.  I'm <br>
just typing out loud here.  <br>
<br>
Does it do anything at all for Ya?<br>

block:<br>
<br>
EAST BY SOUTHWEST, on the corner of 2nd street, owned by non other <br>
than Sergio and Hydi Verduzco....HYDI!!!  She looks New German to <br>

their picture on their website: http://eastbysouthwest.com/review_07-<br>

Y, it seems there is something on that block for all the clues...you <br>
need to scour the area tonight with your second mate!  Tell Eros <br>

Notes that this Saturday event was "inadvertently left off the <br>
printed" schedule but listed online.  Note the sponsor...and some <br>
other piratey talk...Oh and ....omg I thought I was snowbound and <br>
bored.  Clearly the event organizers had some spare time on their <br>
hands.  Funny stuff!<br>
<br>
3 PM OUTHOUSE STUFFING<br>
Hosted by Gazpacho New Mexican Restaurant.<br>
Gazpacho Parking Lot - 431 E. Second Ave.<br>
Are we masterminds or what? Answering that question, SNOWDOWN <br>
presents the 7th Annual Outhouse Stuffing Contest. Be a "Captain of <br>
the Ship" and see how many of your fellow mateys you can stuff into a <br>
porta-pottie in 2 minutes. (Hint: Leave your "very big hooks" at <br>
home!) We'll make sure it's clean. Then, you'll have to stay in there <br>
with the door shut for 10 seconds<br>
