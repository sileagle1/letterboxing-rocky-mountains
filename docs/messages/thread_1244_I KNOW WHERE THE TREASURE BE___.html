&gt; &gt; Y, My Gray Brain cells are still at work on another idea:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If you look at the map at end of E. 2nd near Main there is an <br/>
&gt; Aspen <br/>
&gt; &gt; Winds Gallery....NAY is defined as a "Wind" instrument.  Between <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; and 2nd is The Ore House...A TREASURE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DIG <br/>
&gt; FOR???  <br/>
&gt; &gt; One block from there is the Durango/Silverton RR....also, a <br/>
&gt; &gt; Treasure!  Well, you get the picture!  Somewhere in that <br/>
&gt; vicinity???<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hugs, Peach...hoping I haven't muddied up your brain with these <br/>
&gt; two <br/>
&gt; &gt; crazy ideas!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Ahoy, Y!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, I'm throwing in what my Gray Brain cells came up with:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The Durango Airport???  Let me explain:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Derby comes up on Mapquest to the SE of Durango.  (I don't <br/>
know <br/>
&gt; if <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the rules state that it must be with the city limits).  If you <br/>
&gt; &gt; start <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there and look towards New Mexico there is the Indian <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Reservation...a treasure that you don't need to dig for!?! <br/>
&gt; Within <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the reservation, sits the airport with a street number ending <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in "A"...nay???  I think it was 305A.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, maybe misdirection, I'm certainly famous for that!  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think, Y?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hugs, Dreadliest of Peaches<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .. bring on the clues and let's find <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this thing!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yarrr. I have my kevlar dumpster-diving gloves, my rock-<br/>
&gt; turning <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spatula, and my out-house snorkel with me and ready to go. <br/>
SO <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; without <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; further adieu.....the first batch of clues:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Look at the aft of the map.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) From West Derby look towards New Mexico.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) I'm thinking of a number between 2 and nay, (neigh?).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4) You won't need a shovel to dig for this treasure.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a few ideas myself, but I would rather hear other <br/>
&gt; &gt; possible <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ideas <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before I pollute your minds with what I've been thinking. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thar be brainstorms a-brewin', me hearties,<br/>

by the Splendid Buccaneer about these great ideas.<br/>

I looked high and low....in the mailbox,.....around in the alley <br/>

<br/>
But I do think you're onto something because it's probably hidden <br/>

with Ore. Another interesting thing I noticed this morning is that <br/>
Wild Horse Saloon is next to the Ore House (neigh).<br/>

Two more clues:<br/>
<br/>
5) You are being watched. (This could mean the web-cam that is at <br/>
College and Main, although there is another one run by CDOT at 550 <br/>

<br/>
6) The treasure you seek is not in plain sight. <br/>
<br/>
So, I think we have a few good leads. Unfortunately, I need to work <br/>
now. I'll probably miss the next clue and won't be able to hear it <br/>
until the recap tonight at 6:45, but I'll definitely be checking back <br/>
here and poking around downtown after work.<br/>

Oh, also, I picked up a Chamber of Commerce map and looked behind <br/>

been saying that all week. But, no they make it plain that the ONLY <br/>
way to get clues is on the radio until one day after they are <br/>
announced when you can get them here:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.radiodurango.com/contests_silver%20bullet.htm<br/>
<br/>
The two web cams that I know of are here:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.zeitcam.com/showcam.php?cam=durango&amp;day=20070126<br/>
<br/>
http://www.dickgilbert.com/durangocam3.htm<br/>
<br/>
You bet I'm looking for an X!<br/>
<br/>
And PRE- I think there is a map by the CDOT cam. I picked up the <br/>
Chamber of Commerce map to look behind it, but I didn't think of a <br/>
BIG outdoor map. I'll check that out after work with my second mate, <br/>
Elros.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I was not awoken by Es this morning, but had already <br/>
set sail for town when she called. It is my custom to leave well <br/>
ahead of time so I had plenty of time to stop by the Ore house. I do <br/>
admit that work is REALLY getting in the way. I've asked for Friday <br/>
off.....but the treasure was found on Thursday last year (yikes!). <br/>
And we are expecting snow which I will have to plow no matter what.<br/>
<br/>
I did manage to get the last two clues, however:<br/>
<br/>
7) A New German directs you to look to the sunrise. (New Germany is a <br/>
town in Minnesota----Minnesota Vikings? I don't know of any Germans <br/>
or Vikings pointing east in town).<br/>
<br/>
8) You'll find it at a lower altitude than last year. (That could <br/>
mean about anywhere in town, because the disc golf course is on the <br/>
mesa with the College above town).<br/>
<br/>
Woot! I can see you all have a pirate's heart!<br/>
<br/>
y-nought<br/>
P.S. It will be interesting to see written versions of these clues <br/>
online---it almost sounded like they said "a number between SHOE and <br/>
nay".<br/>

Does Neuer Deutscher (or some similar conjugation?) and/or mennonites <br/>
do anything for you, Y as far as local info/places?  Isn't Minnesota <br/>
known for mennonites?  I did a google on New German and Durango and <br/>
found this.  http://tinyurl.com/2gww6o<br/>

My own German ancestry would point east (to western PA in my case) <br/>

mountains, not plains pictures on it...then I jumped to Pedal the <br/>
Peaks (across the street from ORE House).  You must check out the <br/>
peaks!  Now, I have another interesting possiblity on that same <br/>
block:<br/>
<br/>
EAST BY SOUTHWEST, on the corner of 2nd street, owned by non other <br/>
than Sergio and Hydi Verduzco....HYDI!!!  She looks New German to <br/>
me!!!  And, she's serving Eastern food on East 2nd!!  Check out <br/>
their picture on their website: http://eastbysouthwest.com/review_07-<br/>

<br/>
Y, it seems there is something on that block for all the clues...you <br/>
need to scour the area tonight with your second mate!  Tell Eros <br/>
that Dreadly says hello!<br/>
<br/>
One last thought, could they be leading you towards the river and an <br/>
oar laying about there???<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Dred Peach- The radio station is "KIQX- marks the spot" and they <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; been saying that all week. But, no they make it plain that the <br/>
ONLY <br/>
&gt; way to get clues is on the radio until one day after they are <br/>
&gt; announced when you can get them here:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://www.radiodurango.com/contests_silver%20bullet.htm<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The two web cams that I know of are here:<br/>

&gt; http://www.zeitcam.com/showcam.php?cam=durango&amp;day=20070126<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://www.dickgilbert.com/durangocam3.htm<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You bet I'm looking for an X!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And PRE- I think there is a map by the CDOT cam. I picked up the <br/>
&gt; Chamber of Commerce map to look behind it, but I didn't think of a <br/>
&gt; BIG outdoor map. I'll check that out after work with my second <br/>
mate, <br/>
&gt; Elros.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For the record, I was not awoken by Es this morning, but had <br/>
already <br/>
&gt; set sail for town when she called. It is my custom to leave well <br/>
&gt; ahead of time so I had plenty of time to stop by the Ore house. I <br/>
do <br/>
&gt; admit that work is REALLY getting in the way. I've asked for <br/>
Friday <br/>
&gt; off.....but the treasure was found on Thursday last year (yikes!). <br/>
&gt; And we are expecting snow which I will have to plow no matter what.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I did manage to get the last two clues, however:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 7) A New German directs you to look to the sunrise. (New Germany <br/>
is a <br/>
&gt; town in Minnesota----Minnesota Vikings? I don't know of any <br/>
Germans <br/>
&gt; or Vikings pointing east in town).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 8) You'll find it at a lower altitude than last year. (That could <br/>
&gt; mean about anywhere in town, because the disc golf course is on <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; mesa with the College above town).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Woot! I can see you all have a pirate's heart!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; y-nought<br/>
&gt; P.S. It will be interesting to see written versions of these clues <br/>
&gt; online---it almost sounded like they said "a number between SHOE <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; nay".<br/>

Are we masterminds or what? Answering that question, SNOWDOWN <br/>
presents the 7th Annual Outhouse Stuffing Contest. Be a "Captain of <br/>
the Ship" and see how many of your fellow mateys you can stuff into a <br/>
porta-pottie in 2 minutes. (Hint: Leave your "very big hooks" at <br/>
home!) We'll make sure it's clean. Then, you'll have to stay in there <br/>
with the door shut for 10 seconds<br/>

&gt; Garr, matey!  That be me talkin' about a large outdoor map...with <br/>
&gt; mountains, not plains pictures on it...then I jumped to Pedal the <br/>
&gt; Peaks (across the street from ORE House).  You must check out the <br/>
&gt; peaks!  Now, I have another interesting possiblity on that same <br/>
&gt; block:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I went back to review clues, etc. and me thinks I blundered...I now <br/>
see what Y's point was about the map from reading your postin!  Just <br/>
see me going "Doh"!  I must have originally read your posting too <br/>
quickly because we were both on the same page thinkin' about large <br/>
maps and I wanted to jump ahead with the Pedal the Peaks!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Me most humble apologies!  My ittie bittie brain led me down the <br/>
wayward path!<br/>
<br/>
Hugs, Dreadly....exhausted after all that postin' today and hopin' <br/>
that Y came home with SOMETHING Silver!!!<br/>
