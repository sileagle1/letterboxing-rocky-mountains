I'm particularly interested in the thicker hand made paper that you <br>

I'm doing fine with regular paper thickness, fun prints, velum, etc.  <br>

I've poked around Michaels, Meininger's (a very high quality artist's <br>

stuff(http://www.meininger.com) and good drafter quality erasers, for <br>
those of you who don't know about them...as well as other random <br>
places, but still haven't found exactly what I have in mind.<br>

Can anyone point me in a good direction for CO - both brick and mortar <br>
or a good online store? <br>

Those are pretty much the places I've used.  Plus a few scrapbooking <br>
stores.  I've also used fabric over board.  If you find some <br>
fabulous place, please shout it out!<br>
<br>
I believe that Y-nought had some sweet homemade paper that his <br>
sister made.  Or that he purchased at a fair?  Y?  <br>
<br>
Es, off to Gueries (sp) today for rubber stuff and bookmaking glue<br>

psychedelic paper that her students made and left behind. It's very <br>
groovy, but not the thick handmade stuff that just makes you drool.<br>
<br>
It's my understanding that most of the really sweet paper around here <br>
has been plundered by a certain pirate and is tucked away in a closet <br>
on some remote island.<br>
<br>
And JeLyBean, are you still working on Bard's Tale? I solved that in <br>
about two minutes. I didn't stamp in yet because I've been kinda busy. <br>
I would give you a hint, but Mapsurfer begged me not to.<br>

y-nought, who has crossed the line from eccentric to full blown <br>
delusional. <br>
