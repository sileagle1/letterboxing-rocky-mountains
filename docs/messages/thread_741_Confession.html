of guilt snagged all the First Finder's for Aljan's new series.  These<br>
boxes are over the top!  You've got to go check them out!  You'll want to<br>
savour all the details of these boxes, so leave a good day for them (our<br>
opinion).  With the other boxes, we think that Grand Lake is definitely<br>
worth a good two days worth of letterboxing.<br>
<br>
We have to admit that had you seen these first finder certificates,<br>
there'd be a mad dash for every new Aljan box.  People would call in sick<br>
to work and descend upon this mountain hamlet.  There would be pushing<br>
and shoving, possibly resulting in yet another creepy Grand Lake incident<br>
giving Aljan more material for another box in this series!<br>
<br>
Our bonus was successfully contacting the local Grand Lake master carver<br>
via her fire department connection.  We all had some dinner out at the<br>
lake and did some exchanges.<br>
<br>
It was a letterboxing day to remember!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Indeed it was!  A big thanks to the Catamounts for coming over and looking us up!  It was a great little exchange.  I was really excited to have someone come up and find these boxes so soon and have such nice things to say about them, along with a few good suggestions which have all been heeded!  Super nice people, the boys cracked me up and Falco is quite the gentleman.<br>
 <br>
...wondering if there is any room in the freezer now...<br>
 <br>
The Catamounts have some ***fantabulous*** sig stamps that you should all lure into your boxes one way or another!<br>
