Ok, I admit it. I've been living on sugar for a week. I can't <br/>
believe that I actually walk through my kitchen area, look at the <br/>
cookies, etc.... that friends have dropped off this last week, and<br/>
make a face and go "blah". Maybe it's because there isn't any pie or <br/>
homemade ice cream in there. Is there a help group for TOO MUCH <br/>
SUGAR?<br/>
<br/>
As for WLF (winter letterboxing fever), we are going to New Mexico <br/>
for a road trip! We decided not to go to Lake Tahoe to visit the <br/>
parental units because of the weather, so my son's airflight has to <br/>
be changed from Reno. Unfortunately, all the flights in Salt Lake <br/>
are full, soooooo, we decided we must go south to fly him back to <br/>
school. Roadtrip, letterboxes, oh darn!<br/>
<br/>

Wow! There be some letterboxing and chatting going on now! <br/>
<br/>
We just got back from a little fever reliever ourselves. We found <br/>
three letterboxes by Kat and one by Esmerelda, all around Moab. The <br/>
weather was fine and the boxing was tremendous! Just what the doctor <br/>
ordered.<br/>
<br/>
