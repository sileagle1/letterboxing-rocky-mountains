<title>UT letterboxes</title>
</head>
<body>
Sorry it has taken a while to respond.  Life has been a bit hectic and I've been getting ready for our little gathering this weekend (which was great, by the way.  I love letterboxers!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Utah letterboxes.  I'm not a lot of help since I'm new enough that I haven't been able to get down to box in the southern half yet.  Right now, most of the boxes are in Northern UT.  There are a couple of S. UT boxes-one in Mexican hat in the east and one in St. George in the west.  They are both down towards the corners though, not near I-70.  I don't know anything on their difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
There used to be few more that would have been great trips for you and not too far, but they have been yanked in an ongoing battle with the National Parks Service.  Ryan and Amanda in particular had several that were good, but those boxes have created grief for them and exist no longer.  The sad thing is that there was one outside of Arches (I'm not sure that it was one of theirs) that wasn't on NPS property and still got yanked.  Oh well!<br/>
<br/>
One thing that would be nice for all is if, since finding isn't a huge option, you make some plants for future trips.  For instance, off exit 147 of I-70 there are tons of small, easy walk canyons that are full of petroglyphs.  You get off and there are several hidden, close but not really marked ones like Black Horse Canyon.  Goblin Valley, a little further in on that same exit, is another fun spot.  That one is a state park and better known.  There are amazing rock formations there.  If I remember correctly, the service stations in Green River are usually quite friendly and they can help point you on your way if there aren't any visitor centers around.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you will make some plants down there.  I promise I will come and find them.  Also, there is a woman that I once got an email from that has started letterboxing.  She lives in Southern UT, but works in Salt Lake (how's that for a commute?)  I will send her your address (if I can find hers) and let her know you will be there anyday. Maybe it will motivate a plant or two.<br/>
<br/>
Hope your trip is great!<br/>

<blockquote><tt>Hi Cadenza!  We will be traveling thru Utah next week and I wonder <br/>
if the letterboxes you know about are fairly easy to locate.  We <br/>

a few if they don't take many hours out of the day.  We are on our <br/>

go for the plant still.  If one goes missing, that's the price you sometimes pay.  It's still worth it. As for those that were taken, it was because of being on or near National Park property, which is more than frowned on.  Just plant elsewhere.<br/>
