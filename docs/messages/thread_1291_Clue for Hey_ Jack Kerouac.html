Denver weekend, I have uploaded the clue to the files section of this <br>
group.  Please note, though, that the "On the Road" exhibit ends March <br>
31 so if you are planning to come to Denver for DOD weekend, you can <br>
find the box but you will not be able to see the manuscript exhibit.  <br>
The Hey, Jack Kerouac clue is in a folder called (appropriately <br>
enough) "Letterboxing Clues."  It is also listed on Atlas Quest and <br>
LbNA.<br>
<br>
I am planning to have another box planted by DOD weekend and I will <br>
also upload that clue here in addition to posting on AQ and LbNA.<br>
