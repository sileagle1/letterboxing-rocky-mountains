<br>
I had SO hoped to make some sort of boxing thing happen out of this <br>
very cool weekend-long city exploring event, but my road trip took <br>
up that time... I didn't get a box planted specifically for it (it <br>
COULD happen this week....dunno yet..)<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, on the off anyone finds themselves in, or passing <br>
through Denver next weekend (April 22-23)check out:<br>
<br>
http://www.denvergov.org/doorsopendenver/<br>
<br>
Some buildings that are NEVER open to the public will be open, some <br>
parts of buildings not usually accesible will be, and so on. I went <br>
last year and had a blast.  Apparently it's modeled after other such <br>
events in Toronto, etc.<br>
<br>
It has a very high cool and fun factor and I do already have some <br>
boxes in Central Denver one could work in...<br>
<br>
On that note, it's been pointed out to me that GME II had a bad <br>
compass bearing and Play Ball is available ALL Colorado Rockies <br>
season (not just a week or so either side of Opening Day which my <br>
clues seemed to imply).  Sorry about that, but they're all fixed now!<br>
<br>
pre<br>
If anyone is interested in going, I'll probably be exploring BOTH <br>
days of the weekend and would be happy to play hostess...<br>
