no longer - at this time - going to require permits for letterboxes. nor are<br>
they limiting how many boxes per park or per boxer.. HOWEVER, they would<br>
still like to be notified when we place a box and they would still like us<br>
to follow the rules of placing them on or very close to the trails, etc.. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
So - looks like my 2 boxes in Lair O Bear were NOT taken by Jeffco, but most<br>
likely "found" by a non-boxer.  Not sure if I will be replacing them or<br>
not.. <br>

a while searching for it since I KNEW it was here.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have any updates on this info since August?  Anyone <br>
planted in Jeff Co since then have any experience with how it went, <br>
etc, whom to contact exactly (other than just calling the regular <br>
#)?  Anything else to share re: placing in Jeffco?  <br>
<br>
Btw, I know from recent boxing trips the Jeff Co that rangers DO <br>
check the boxes....From the ones I've seen (about 3 in the past 6 <br>
weeks or so) nothing more than "Ranger Status Check" and a date...no <br>
other comments.  I get a smile from them and wish they'd join in the <br>
fun and carve some stamps ;-)<br>
<br>
You get one guess why I'm asking!<br>
<br>
Any/all comments apPREciated!<br>
