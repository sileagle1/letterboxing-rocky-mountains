                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just came back from a short trip to CA...  talked my Aunt into doing some boxing (letterwhat?  What is it that you want to do?  Explain it to me one more time...).  Hit a fun Halloween series hidden in places around LA where famous murders or suicides happened.  Kinda morbid but really cool!  Wouldn't be surprised if somebody called the police...  I was out at the highest span on "the suicide bridge" looking for the box in the pouring down rain (don't fret, I safely toted the box back to the dry confines of the car for stamping in and then returned the box), soaked to the bone, with no shoes - who walks off without packing sneakers when they know they're going boxing leaving themselves nothing but stupid heels? and certainly looking quite lost as I peered around the rails of the bridge searching for the box.  I am sure that more than one passing motorist thought I was going for the big jump!  <br>
 <br>
A good time and my Aunt has already put in a request for her stamp design.  Took a hitcher to plant but couldn't find a box big enough.  Bum.<br>
 <br>
And I brought back snacks for Es!  Yummies from Trader Joes!!<br>
