   <br>
  Thanks to everyone that came and made the event such a good time!  I had a blast, meeting a few new folks, wasn't that couple from NM FUN!, and catching up with some old friends.  <br>
   <br>
  I can't believe the moose luck that we had!  I guess that feeding them alflafa and sweet grain all through the spring and summer really kept them around...  hee hee.<br>
   <br>
  Keep the pictures coming!<br>
   <br>
  Aljan - off to hunt some boxes and SOOOO excited that I don't have to drive for two hours to get to one!  Thanks to FRH and PRE (and YES, I was out on the point this afternoon claiming my first finder while the kids did some fishing!)  <br>
