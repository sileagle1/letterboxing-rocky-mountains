Here I am, putting myself on the line, I have severe cabin fever <br/>
(perhaps fault of my own), okay I am going snowshoeing this weekend -<br/>
 cut to the chase:  Would anyone be interested in a late March <br/>
gathering?  March 27th perhaps?  I am willing to coordinate/host <br/>
this event.  I simply want to know if there is interest first? If <br/>
so, I will look for a suitable location (depending on weather) - I <br/>
would prefer to have it outdoors.  As we all know, Colorado weather <br/>
is unpredictable.  It would be nice to see everyone again and <br/>
hopefully meet the newer boxers.  I suppose I miss the dialogue in <br/>
our area for this hobby.  Don't let cabin fever stop YOU!<br/>

Looking forward to your replies!<br/>

Hey Autumn, no wimps allowed - hee, hee!  Of course, YOU must be <br/>

We're here - just hibernating. =]<br/>
<br/>
Samurai and I can probably make it. We're ususally good to go on <br/>
Saturday's (save for the 20th, for reasons that Autumn has already <br/>
mentioned.) Depends on time and place. <br/>
<br/>
I'll forward this along to some other folks that don't always check <br/>
the message board.<br/>

&gt; &gt; C'mon, there must be more interest????  Thanks to all of you <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; have replied so far! <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hey Autumn, no wimps allowed - hee, hee!  Of course, YOU <br/>
must be<br/>
&gt; &gt; there!  Perhaps if the weather IS bad, we can find a warm, <br/>
cozy<br/>
&gt; &gt; spot  inside - maybe even a happy hour, Saturday lunch or <br/>
dinner. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just  some time to gather, catch up, exchange ideas, stamp in, <br/>
etc.....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Don't be shy!  Where is everyone?<br/>
