Well, Google just finished up a 24 daily puzzle tied in with the <br>
opening of the DaVinci Code, maybe some of you are in too!  A small <br>
number of finishers....errr...large number...10,000...people get a stab <br>
at the final quest!  They mailed the 10,000 finalist a codex (like in <br>
the book) and it's your entry into the final contest!  I got mine <br>
today!  I'm so excited!  Now, starting Friday for 48 hours I can access <br>
the site and do a series of 5 puzzles.  You can access at any time but <br>
once you start you can't pause or quit and come back...the quickest <br>
time wins a trip for 4 to London, Paris, Rome and every product that <br>
Sony makes worth $148,000!  I know it will be tough to win the final <br>
prize, but, hey, somebody has to win!  Any brains available on Friday <br>
to tap if need be??? <br>
<br>
Hugs, Dread Peach...So Dark the con of Man!<br>
