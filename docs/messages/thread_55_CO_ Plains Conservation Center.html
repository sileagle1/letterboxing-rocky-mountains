a nature preserve.  They have a very large prairie dog town along one <br>
of the trails.  My dog would be in heaven!  :)  However, the prairie <br>
dogs would most likely object!  <br>

If you ever feel like boxing without the pooches, it really is an <br>
interesting place.  I saw a small herd of white tailed deer (with <br>
young) and some burrowing owls, as well as many, many prairie dogs.<br>
<br>
Very cool place.<br>
