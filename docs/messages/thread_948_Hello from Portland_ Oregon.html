                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi you all - I plan to join and watch this list for the next two weeks<br/>
or so - will be flying to Colorado Springs to visit my daughter in<br/>
Canon City on the 21st, saying six days or so.  We will not have a lot<br/>
of time to letterbox, but I have a box ready to plant and leave for<br/>
you, and I would like to find at least one or two for my log book.  We<br/>
will probably spend our time between Canon City and Colorado Springs,<br/>
so I would appreciate having the names of any boxes with these<br/>
attributes:  (1) not much more than a mile hike, having some hip<br/>
problems and can't go further right now; (2) would like to know of at<br/>
least one that is large enough for a darling hitchhiker that is 2 1/4"<br/>
x 3 3/4 ", about 3/4" thick, which I am bringing with me for a friend<br/>
(please e-mail me privately so it won't be too obvious where I plan to<br/>
leave it).  I know about Red Canyon Park and Cabin on Shelf, but the<br/>
placers are from Oregon, and I would really like some images from you<br/>
folks in Colorado as well.  So anything between Coal Creek and<br/>
Colorado Springs that isn't a real strenuous hike or covered in deep<br/>
snow would be great to know about.  I've checked out all of the boxes<br/>
listed at LBNA for Colorado Springs and printed clues for Little Feet,<br/>
Greenback Cutthroat Trout, Bear Creek, Pikes Peak, and Fountain Creek<br/>
- are any of those close together by car and/or big enough for my<br/>
hitchhiking friend?  Any information will be so appreciated.  My<br/>
daughter is not into letterboxing but will go with me after a couple<br/>
I'm sure.  If I can't find a home for the hitchhiker I can leave it in<br/>
the box I plant, so that isn't really important, but I would rather<br/>
leave it in someone else's box if I can.  Hope to see one of you on<br/>
the trail!  Calli-K from Oregon.<br/>

- Little Feet: no, it's a film cannister microbox<br/>
- Greenback Cutthroat Trout: probably not, it's a small box about <br/>
2.5" square (most of mine are this size)<br/>
- Bear Creek: maybe - did this one some time ago and don't remember <br/>
it very well.  It's on a nature center trail and requires some <br/>
moderate uphill walks.<br/>
- Pikes Peak, the box is probably big enough, but there's no stamp <br/>
and I would think twice about driving up the mountain this time of <br/>
year<br/>
- Fountain Creek: maybe - did this one some time ago and don't <br/>
remember it very well.  It's pretty flat if I recall, on nature <br/>
trails through some marshland.  Can't remember how big the box is.<br/>
<br/>
You might also consider Chantress, which is a fairly short and level <br/>
walk in a nice setting, although in the northern part of the <br/>
Springs, and both Red Rock Canyon and CONTEMPLATIVE TRAIL/GARDEN of <br/>
the GODDESSES, which are a little longer but pretty nice, near <br/>
Garden of the Gods.  Red Rock Canyon will require some climbing some <br/>
stairs in an old quarry.<br/>

normal sized.<br/>
Bear Creek...when Colorado Celt and I hiked down the trail to this <br/>
one, it was missing it's stamp.  I don't remember if anyone ever said <br/>
if it had been replaced or not. <br/>
