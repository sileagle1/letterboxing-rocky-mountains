OK so not really.  But I am scribbling at a new stamp design.  How big do you think is too big for the stamp?  This one is sitting at about 5 inches tall and 3 1/2 wide.  Too big huh?  Thinking I will have to shrink it down a bit.  This is gonna be a good one y'all!<br/>
<br/>
Off to plant on Sunday!  (Not this one, another one...  a set)<br/>

<br/>
We have your Bird/Berry combo - lovely stamps! And the trail was <br/>
really cool, although mostly underwater when we got the box in the <br/>
spring.<br/>
<br/>
We are Amy and Greg's friends, if that makes sense to you. We call <br/>
her 'Mo' and that tends to confuse everyone! =3<br/>
<br/>
A big stamp usually isn't a problem as long as you let people know <br/>
ahead of time, that way they don't track it down, just to find out it <br/>
won't fit in their book. But I'm with y-nought, it will fit fine in <br/>
our book!<br/>
<br/>
Nice to have you here!<br/>

Not much more than the bird.  Thanks for the tip though, I'll mention in the clues that it's kinda big.  My book is fairly large too so I don't worry about it much (got it from Oberon Designs - they make really nice journals!).  You'll have to come up after it and visit and such.<br/>
