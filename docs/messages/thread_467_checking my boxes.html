Sadly, the Lemony Letterbox is definitely gone.  It appears as <br>
though there was some grooming done on the trail in October or <br>
November (don't know when the box was last found, check your books) <br>
and the tree that was well surrounded by dense weeds was given a <br>
crewcut.  I am going to call South Suburban Parks and Recreation to <br>
see if it was turned in to lost & found by their maintenence crew, <br>
but I am not holding my breath.<br>
<br>
Dilbox is still safe, though it was peeking from its hiding place <br>
and could have been easily spotted by a non-boxer.  I hid it better <br>
and hopefully anyone else who finds it will hide it even better.<br>
<br>
Found with Bite My Shiny Letter Box that the trail and tree had also <br>
been groomed recently, but luckily someone had moved the box a bit <br>
further from the trail and tree but in the same general area (and <br>
put it in a Ziploc as well, for some reason).  We checked out <br>
JodieMKern's husband's stamp and it is really cool!!!<br>
<br>
So the lesson learned:  don't hide your letterboxes too close to a <br>
South Suburban trail.<br>
