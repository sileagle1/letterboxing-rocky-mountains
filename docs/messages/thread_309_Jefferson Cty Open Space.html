Jefferson County Open Space has seen a large increase in geocaching and<br/>
letterboxing.  Unfortunately, some of the sites are in sensitive areas<br/>
or in areas that have seasonal closures.  While we do allow placement of<br/>
caches and letterboxes, site owners must apply for and receive a special<br/>
activity permit prior to placing anything on Open Space property.  Your<br/>
website lists several letterboxes that do not have permits.  Is there a<br/>
way for you to contact the placers and ask them to contact Jefferson<br/>

It's nice to have more people l'boxing in that you have more boxes,<br/>

I'm glad that JeffCo has been so good about allowing the hobbies to go<br/>

causing any damage. They're really a model of friendly and appropriate<br/>
response. Other counties (Boulder, for example) have just jumped the<br/>

'littering'. I've been considering going legit with my boxes in JeffCo<br/>
for awhile but guess I don't have much choice now. Coleen didn't list<br/>
some of my other boxes that are in the OS parks but I plan on becoming<br/>
respectable for all the ones I've hidden in those parks.<br/>
<br/>
It'd be nice if one permit could handle everyone, but I think that the<br/>
real point is for JeffCo to have a chance to review each box one at a<br/>
time to make sure they are responsibly hidden.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought is that we invite her to join the RMLB list so she<br/>
knows we are friendly and willing to cooperate with JeffCoOS policies.<br/>
I personaly think it important that regardless of the similarities<br/>
letterboxing has with geocaching, that we, as a smaller group, work to<br/>
differentiate ourselves from the geocachers, if only because we are<br/>
smaller, more local, and less under the thumb of a single big .com<br/>
company. (I'm not bashing geocaching, I've been doing it for a long<br/>
time too.) It just seems that because MORE people geocache than<br/>
letterbox, we should try to emphasize that our 'boxes' get less<br/>
traffic and that because of the stamp our boxes are typically more<br/>
thoughtfully crafted and hidden than much of the 'geotrash' hidden out<br/>
there.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; It'd be nice if one permit could handle everyone, but I think that <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; real point is for JeffCo to have a chance to review each box one at <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; time to make sure they are responsibly hidden.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Eoghan makes some good points. I think it is important to stress how <br/>
we care for each box, rather than placing so many we don't care if a <br/>
few get lost. And I think an application for each box would go along <br/>
with that. It is also important to show that we place boxes in spots <br/>
that we love and would rather move a box than contribute to its <br/>
demise.<br/>
<br/>
Onion is my only box up there. It isn't on the list, but I plan to <br/>
fill out an application. It would possibly survive for a while <br/>
without a permit but I don't see the point in pushing that. <br/>

I also emailed Colleen and below is her response.  I assume if we have 1 permit (at least for existing boxes) we would probably have to notify the out of staters and make sure it was ok with them.  I know Team Min Dawg is one but I think they monitor this list.  Funhog is another .  Ill send her an email.<br/>
I dont know who Amy is or if she is local.  Of course Autumn and Eoghan are here.  The Jolly G Man wants his boxes pulled anyway.  He did say at one time we could adopt them but he wanted the log book back (Soar Feet and the other one which name escapes me)..but they are no longer on the list so maybe they finally got pulled and sent back to him.<br/>
Then there are a few boxes like eoghan said that werent on the list.<br/>
I would be happy to do this for everyone but I have no boxes placed<br/>
there.  Or someone local with boxes placed there can do it......<br/>

Colleens Response:<br/>
I think that would be fine if someone local wants to assume<br/>
responsibility for all the sites.  In fact it may make coordination of<br/>
the permit much easier from our end.<br/>

Hi Colleen:<br/>
Regarding the letterboxes in Jefferson County Open Space areas.<br/>
Can 1 person apply for all of them or do they need to be done<br/>
separately?<br/>
Several of the placers are from out of state (in fact most of them)<br/>
and<br/>
one of us locals would be happy to do it for them.  Please let me<br/>
know.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Lisa Cook<br/>
