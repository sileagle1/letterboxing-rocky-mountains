Stashing the Cache: Hidden treasure is waiting for you to find with <br>
your GPS<br>
<br>
BY DAVID KENNARD - dkennard@idahostatesman.com<br>
Edition Date: 04/24/08<br>
<br>
With names like Idtimberwolf, Seamonsters in the Mist or Idaho <br>
Taters, a group of modern-day treasure hunters is building a sport <br>
growing in popularity in the Treasure Valley.<br>
They call themselves geocachers.<br>
<br>
"In the last year, it has really taken off," said Rob Lytle of <br>
Meridian, aka. Idtimberwolf. He's one of the founding members of the <br>
Treasure Valley Geocachers Anonymous, a loose association of <br>
local "cachers."<br>
<br>
Outfitted with handheld GPS units, sturdy walking shoes and a veiled <br>
desire for remaining anonymous, they quietly promote their sport - <br>
mostly by word of mouth.<br>
<br>
"It started out with three or four of us who would go out and find <br>
some caches and then going to have a beer," Lytle said. "After a <br>
while we thought it would be fun to invite some others."<br>
<br>
That was in 2004. The cachers now gather monthly at local pizza <br>
restaurants, hamburger joints or other family friendly locales to <br>
share their caching tales and to put faces to the bizarre names that <br>
turn up on tiny log books hidden in trees and under rocks all across <br>
the Treasure Valley.<br>
<br>
Another cacher, Jason Siebenthall, aka Seven Valleys, found a calling <br>
with his caching hobby while out wandering the sage brush near <br>
Initial Point south of Kuna. <br>
<br>
The mini-mountain of lava has several geocaches hidden among its <br>
lowlands. Unfortunately they are becoming harder to find among the <br>
debris finding its way into the area thanks to litterbugs too cheap <br>
to haul their trash to a landfill<br>
<br>
"I was out in the area and couldn't believe how much junk is out <br>
there. Tires, old appliances," he said. So he called the BLM and <br>
organized a "Cache In, Trash Out" event - something cachers are <br>
beginning to become known for.<br>
<br>
"It's just part of caching," Siebenthall said. "You're out there <br>
enjoying nature and you want to make it better."<br>
<br>
And you never know what you'll find. Sometimes it's a McDonald's toy, <br>
sometimes its a rare coin. And sometimes it's a wife.<br>
<br>
Lytle said when he heard about a group of cachers headed to Portland <br>
to visit the original geocache he signed on.<br>
<br>
"That was the trip I met my wife," he said. "That was kick."<br>
<br>
Now the two enjoy their hobby together with their 5-month-old <br>
daughter.<br>
<br>
HIDDEN TREASURE<br>
<br>
Literally hundreds of treasure chests - many containing rare coins <br>
from around the world - are hidden throughout the Boise area, but <br>
unless you know how to find them, you wouldn't even know they are <br>
there.<br>
<br>
Some of these caches are disguised as everyday objects on urban <br>
street corners, others are buried under rocks or logs along the <br>
Greenbelt or in city parks. And all contain a prize for those who <br>
enjoy the sport of geocaching.<br>
<br>
Geocaching has been around for only eight years, but the number of <br>
hidden boxes grows daily. Nearly 100 geocaches have been hidden along <br>
the Greenbelt between Lucky Peak Dam and Eagle Island State Park.<br>
<br>
Geocachers use handheld receivers that read information broadcast to <br>
Earth from orbiting satellites. It's the same technology used in <br>
newer cars with mapping systems. A person using a GPS receiver can <br>
find their location anyplace on the globe. Better systems are <br>
accurate to a few square feet.<br>
<br>
They find clues from fellow geocachers and from several Web sites <br>
that post latitude and longitude coordinates to thousands of hidden <br>
locations on every continent of the planet.<br>
<br>
Each cache - usually in the form of a Tupperware bowl, military ammo <br>
box or coffee can - is hidden by fellow geocachers. The contents <br>
change daily as people visit the sites and trade items.<br>
<br>
The game is a sport for the technology age, but embraced by anyone <br>
who loves the journey as much as the prize.<br>
<br>
Stealth is key, and a loose set of rules governs the game. The <br>
treasure, as valuable as it may be is never kept, but is shared and <br>
passed along from cache to cache for others to find.<br>
<br>
For instance, when a geocache hunter finds a cache he opens the box, <br>
signs and dates a log book then trades one treasure for another. Some <br>
cache chests are very small and contain only a log sheet with no <br>
treasure. These micro caches - usually the size of a 35 mm film <br>
canister or smaller - are more difficult to find and are considered <br>
more prized.<br>
<br>
Other caches are disguised as common things such as large rocks, tree <br>
stumps or electrical boxes. There's even one cache in the Foothills <br>
disguised as a cow patty.<br>
<br>
After a hunter finds a cache they record their find at geocaching.com <br>
where cache owners can then watch to see who has discovered their <br>
treasures.<br>

<br>
It's not just Idaho boxes that are at risk.  The May/June issue of<br>
"Scouting" magazine has an article on "geoscouting" (essentially<br>
geocaching).  This could generate interest from Tiger Cubs to Eagle<br>
Scouts.  Although I feel in general scouting works to instill a<br>
respect for the environment, it sure doesn't come naturally to some kids.<br>
<br>
Hide well, watching over your shoulder & covering your tracks...<br>
