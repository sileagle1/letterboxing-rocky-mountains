Skeetch and I have commented to each other how aware you are of where <br>
they are and who is in charge of who.  I don't think any amount of <br>
preparation would have kept that lion from attacking!  50 feet from <br>
the parking lot?!  Seven people in the group AND he was holding his <br>
dad's hand?!  Wow.  That was some aggressive lion!<br>
<br>
I carry pepper spray, and when I'm hiking anywhere that is even <br>
marginal, I'll keep it in my hand.  My thoughts are that I would end <br>
up using it on an animal more likely than a people.  <br>
<br>
Es, glad the little boy is okay<br>

Were you actually thinking "aware" or "neurotic."  Ever wonder why this<br>
family of bird and canine lovers picked the Catamount Carvers for our<br>
family sig?  We actually do live in the midst of prime lion habitat.  The<br>
elusive lion has been spied by Silent Wings on one occasion, spied by<br>
Yoque on four occasions and we see signs on a regular basis (tracks, scat<br>
and kills).  A number of our neighbors have lost animals to them here and<br>
there.  We had a lion use our rooftop to ambush an unsuspecting deer in<br>
the middle of the night a few summers ago.  That was pretty hair raising!<br>
 "Habituated lion" is a term we take pretty seriously.<br>
~Silent Wings, wondering what the big cats think about us bipeds caching<br>
inedible things in their territory<br>
