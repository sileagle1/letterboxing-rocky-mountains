has scored with the toys!<br/>

Of course, Paisley will be a 'boxing dog. She is a BOXER after all.<br/>
The trails will be crowded this spring with puppies.8~D<br/>

One note of caution to you, Es, re: getting a puppy when you retire.<br/>
It IS a great time as far as having lots of time to tend to it and<br/>
train it. However, we've sort of gotten cabin fever in the sense that<br/>
we have been pretty tied down when we could have been footloose and<br/>
fancy-free. I think it's been worth it, but then I've been retired for<br/>
3 years now. Beemer Rider (Al) had only joined the ranks of the<br/>
unemployed a few weeks before Paisley came on the scene and he hadn't<br/>
gotten the freedom out of his system.<br/>
<br/>
I'm off to my daughter's home in Midway for Christmas - we will<br/>
DEFINATELY be having a white Christmas there.<br/>
<br/>
Many blessings to my Rocky Mt friends!<br/>
