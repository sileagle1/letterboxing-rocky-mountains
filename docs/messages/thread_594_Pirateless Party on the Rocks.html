Well, thanks for the kind words.  (Pirates are really softies and <br>
get verklemp so easily.)  I'll be wantin' to see some pictures and <br>
hear lots of stories of all the scurvey mongrels what goes to the <br>
party!  Including the Tales of Pie!  I'll salute towards Moab as I <br>
shoost through the sky on my mission to keep mankind from thirst on <br>
their one hour shoosts.  ::sigh::<br>
<br>
But it's still early in the year.. I say we have another one when <br>
summertime rolls around, eh?!  Y'all will be good at it by then and <br>
maybe we can plan it on a day that isn't integration for me.. which <br>
is surely the worst day of the schedule cuz if you're alive, ye'll <br>
be flyin'!  But I digress.  As pirates are often wont to do.  arrr.<br>
<br>
My good friend, Dread Pirate Miss Moon is sort of planning on <br>
visiting late this summer.. perhaps then...until then I must live on <br>
my dreams and all y'alls stories and pictures. Of which I hope there <br>
are many. <br>

Oh, oh, somebody give that poor sad pirate a biiiigggg hug! We will <br>
certainly miss you, but will raise our drinks in a loud piratey <br>
salute, saying AARRRRH! I am definitely going to have to come back <br>
to GJ soon and plant that box, just to get that sad scurvy, <br>
scuffling the feet, slumping shoulders, sadness to go away!!!!<br>
<br>
And..... Ravenwolf, to answer your question, Y-nought is working on <br>
an event stamp, and I am working on an event box for the big day!!!!<br>
<br>
Someone else asked about an alternate plan in case of bad weather <br>
that day, but the picnic section I reserved is covered. They have it <br>
covered in case of heat or rain!<br>
<br>
Kat (noticing that the trees at the park have all started to pop out <br>
today. Spring is springing!!!)<br>

Oh, oh, somebody give that poor sad pirate a biiiigggg hug! We will <br>
certainly miss you, but will raise our drinks in a loud piratey <br>
salute, saying AARRRRH! I am definitely going to have to come back <br>
to GJ soon and plant that box, just to get that sad scurvy, <br>
scuffling the feet, slumping shoulders, sadness to go away!!!!<br>
<br>
And..... Ravenwolf, to answer your question, Y-nought is working on <br>
an event stamp, and I am working on an event box for the big day!!!!<br>
<br>
Someone else asked about an alternate plan in case of bad weather <br>
that day, but the picnic section I reserved is covered. They have it <br>
covered in case of heat or rain!<br>
<br>
Kat (noticing that the trees at the park have all started to pop out <br>
today. Spring is springing!!!)<br>
