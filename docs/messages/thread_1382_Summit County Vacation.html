If Ramdelt does not have time to wait for the journal to be mailed, <br>
We could possibly replace it for you. We will be in the area on Labor <br>
Day Weekend. As long as the hike is not too long (We have a three <br>
year old), just let us know. We will also be at the Gathering in <br>
Golden the week before if you will be there.<br>
<br>
We also would be interested in WOM boxes or if anyone can make some <br>
recommendations on boxes in the area. <br>

P.S. I apologize if this is a duplicate message. Is there a delay <br>
when you send a message? I did not see my reply so I thought I would <br>
send it again. I am new to yahoo groups!<br>

Hello Puzzlers and welcome to the group!<br>
<br>
I've 'spoken' with Ramdelt and we've made arrangements for replacing the<br>
logbook for my LB in Breck.  Thank you for your offer to help though.<br>
[:D]   Sadly, I'm not planning on attending the Golden gathering -<br>
although it does sound like a blast!  All you folks, pirates, etc have a<br>
wonderful time gobbling up that pie!  Oh, and exchanging, boxing, et al,<br>
as well.<br>
<br>
