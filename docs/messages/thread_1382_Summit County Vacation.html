Ramdelt, will you be going to Breckenridge?  I have a LB there whose<br/>
logbook is getting full.  Can you add another/replace it?  Do I have<br/>
time to mail you a replacement before you leave town?  If you can help,<br/>
please email your address privately.<br/>

If Ramdelt does not have time to wait for the journal to be mailed, <br/>
We could possibly replace it for you. We will be in the area on Labor <br/>
Day Weekend. As long as the hike is not too long (We have a three <br/>
year old), just let us know. We will also be at the Gathering in <br/>
Golden the week before if you will be there.<br/>
<br/>
We also would be interested in WOM boxes or if anyone can make some <br/>
recommendations on boxes in the area. <br/>

when you send a message? I did not see my reply so I thought I would <br/>
send it again. I am new to yahoo groups!<br/>

Hello Puzzlers and welcome to the group!<br/>
<br/>
I've 'spoken' with Ramdelt and we've made arrangements for replacing the<br/>
logbook for my LB in Breck.  Thank you for your offer to help though.<br/>
[:D]   Sadly, I'm not planning on attending the Golden gathering -<br/>
although it does sound like a blast!  All you folks, pirates, etc have a<br/>
wonderful time gobbling up that pie!  Oh, and exchanging, boxing, et al,<br/>
as well.<br/>

&gt; If Ramdelt does not have time to wait for the journal to be mailed,<br/>
&gt; We could possibly replace it for you. We will be in the area on Labor<br/>
&gt; Day Weekend. As long as the hike is not too long (We have a three<br/>
&gt; year old), just let us know. We will also be at the Gathering in<br/>
&gt; Golden the week before if you will be there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We also would be interested in WOM boxes or if anyone can make some<br/>
&gt; recommendations on boxes in the area.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ramdelt, will you be going to Breckenridge? I have a LB there whose<br/>
&gt; &gt; logbook is getting full. Can you add another/replace it? Do I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; time to mail you a replacement before you leave town? If you can<br/>
&gt; help,<br/>
&gt; &gt; please email your address privately.<br/>
