<br>
The first is Symbols of Colorado #1: Greenback Cutthroat Trout.  In <br>
addition to being the state fish of Colorado, it's also a letterbox in <br>
need of help.  claudey was kind enough to pull it for me when it got <br>
soaked and moldy.  Now it is newly scrubbed, logbook replaced, and <br>
ready to head back to its home.  If anyone is planning on going up to <br>
Rampart Reservoir near CO Springs this summer and can replace it for <br>
me, please contact me off list at jelybean "dot" books "at" <br>
comcast "dot" net.<br>
<br>
The second and more important is a letterbox commemorating the wedding <br>
of a couple of local letterboxers, our very own y-nought and La <br>
Paloma.  If you didn't get a chance to attend and are going to be in <br>
California anytime soon, you can still participate in this grand event <br>
by visiting http://tinyurl.com/326czj or by looking up Beth and Ed's <br>
Wedding Box on the mystery page for California.  If you already <br>
attended, make sure to visit this page and sign the guestbook!<br>
