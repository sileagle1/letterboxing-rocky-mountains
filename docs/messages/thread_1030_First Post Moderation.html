I just wanted to let you know of a minor change to our board that will <br/>
not affect any of you, but will affect any new members that join us.  <br/>
Due to spam coming through the Yahoo system, we've moved to "First Post <br/>
Moderation".  <br/>
<br/>
What this means is that when a new member joins us and creates their <br/>
first post, it will be moderated.  If it is appropriate (ie: to do with <br/>
letterboxing, pirates, or pie) it will post.  If it isn't appropriate, <br/>
it will be deleted, as will (likely) the author. <br/>
<br/>
So, please feel free to invite your local boxing friends to our list - <br/>
but tell them not to worry if their first couple of posts dont show up <br/>
for awhile!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers, happy trails, and lots of pirate pie ...<br/>
