Thanks for posting the pictures everyone.  I'll get to that one of <br/>
these days.  My husband has a big test tomorrow so I don't want to bug <br/>
him for his computer skills til after.  =-)  <br/>
<br/>
I'm debating whether or not I dare scrapbook my stamps that I've <br/>
found.  I know it'd be a huge project, but after seeing some of the <br/>
neat logbooks this weekend, I'm really tempted to do so.....<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps I'll just get out my carving tools and plant some more boxes <br/>
instead.  =-)  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the photos.  =-)  <br/>

Add my thanks as well. I love all the pictures. Especially the <br/>
pictures out on the trails, it makes me feel like I was out there <br/>
with you guys instead of baking pies all day and night (LOL)!<br/>
