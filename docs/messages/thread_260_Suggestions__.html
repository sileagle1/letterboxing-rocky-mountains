The Samurai Stamper, Little Wolf and I are going to "the BIG park" in <br>
Wyoming. We will be in our neighboring state the 28th through the 7th <br>
and are looking for some recommendations of good boxes to look for <br>
during our trip.<br>
<br>
Any and all advice will be appreciated!<br>

You need to read the clues of the boxes listed in that area and the area that includes Cody.  Let me know if you need some more direction.<br>
