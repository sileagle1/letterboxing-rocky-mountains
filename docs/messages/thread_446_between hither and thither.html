I'd also recommend doing some kickass stamping in my letterboxes. A <br>
couple of them may have thawed this week in this heat wave. And if <br>
it's as awesome as your own stamp I'd like to see it no matter whose <br>

Just one of those things that came out just like I hoped it would.  Guess I'm getting better at making the images in shapes instead of lines that never come out in the carving like I think they will.  It'll turn up in someones box soon.   ...maybe the nice dry left hander after Kat went to all that work to get it back in shape.    <br>
