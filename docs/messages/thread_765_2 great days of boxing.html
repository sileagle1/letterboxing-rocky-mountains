                    <div class="plaintext-content">Saturday and Sunday were great days for boxing in the high country.  Saturday we headed up to Grand Lake and Granby.  Boxes found were Grand Lake Letterbox, Mommy Dearest, Two Tracks, The Commissioner Shootings, Quoth the Raven Overhere, None Other Beeste, and The Strangest Bird.  If you have not seen these stamp images, they are amazing!  Well done Aljan!!!  Unfortunately we did not have enough time for Metamorphosis but will have to go back for it.  Also, I could not find Spirit Lake...maybe the spirits of the lake carried it away?<br/>
<br/>
Sunday we started off at the park near Kittredge to find The Surefooted Ram and Embodiment of Purity, however I fear that they have now been pulled.  I know that Debbi had mentioned the possibility of that happening and I would say that it definately has happened.  From here we went and found Zeke's Letterbox.  I have a couple of suggestions for those of you who have not found this box yet.  Do not attempt to pack your kids to the box and back.  My wife and I did this with our 2 and 3 year olds and nearly collapsed.  Secondly, the clues mention a radio tower, however I never saw one and thus, don't keep walking until you see one like we did.  If you like a good, longer, tougher hike than most in the Denver area, hit Zeke's Letterbox.<br/>
