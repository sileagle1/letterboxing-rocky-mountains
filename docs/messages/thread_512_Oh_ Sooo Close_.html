 I went into town, picked up Elros from a birthday party, and was on <br>
Second Avenue by the Leland House when they announced all the clues <br>
and added the next one:<br>
<br>
25. The west is best.<br>
<br>
26. Near the Summit the Dreamweaver will Rendezvous with Serenity.<br>
<br>
28. Men stand close to enjoy the show, women remain seated.<br>
<br>
So we hightailed it a block down to Main Avenue where The Summit, <br>
Dreamweaver, Les Rendesvous, and Serenity are. In front of Magpies <br>
were some portable toilets set up for the Superhero Quick Change <br>
Contest. There were about eight people there looking things over. I <br>
went up to the Johns and inspected them too, looking behind the <br>
posters and up on top etc. After that it was kinda fun watching as <br>
group after group of people came by and did the same thing. We <br>
realized that we were too late, checked the bathrooms over at the <br>
Strater Hotel and at Farquahrts just to make sure and came home. Much <br>
to my surprise it was announced that it hadn't been found. The DJ <br>
that was broadcasting live from Magpies at the contest said "A lot of <br>
people are VERY WARM, they just need to step up and reach down deep <br>
and pull". So then somebody stood on the flower bed by the Bob's <br>
John, reached into the vent and pulled a blue string with the Bullet <br>
Wrapped in a T-shirt so it wouldn't bang around when we shook the <br>
John.<br>
<br>
"West" referred to the west side of Main. Santa Rita, aka Gateway, is <br>
right next to the sewer plant. Some other references I don't get, but <br>
they will be posted some time next week.<br>
<br>
The clues were much better this year and this is by far the closest <br>
I've ever been. I'm a little ashamed that I wasn't thorough enough to <br>
reach up there. If I were looking for a letterbox and I was alone, I <br>
think I would have. (There are a lot of other people that are wishing <br>
the same thing).<br>
<br>
This was also the most fun I've had at this because my letterboxing <br>
buddies were helping me and cheering me on. Thanks again to all of <br>
you. We'll get it next year and there will be Mastercarve and pie for <br>
everybody!<br>

Total bummer, Y, I was really rooting for you.  Must go drown my <br>
sorrows with a big fat slice of pumpkin pie.<br>
<br>
Es, sorry about the link getting cut off.  If you have kids you may <br>
already know about Jimmy Neutron's pie-fanatic dad.  Possibly you <br>
are twins seperated at birth...<br>
<br>
JeLyBean, thinking, it's just like a letterbox, but only one person <br>
gets to find it.  Hmmmm.....<br>
