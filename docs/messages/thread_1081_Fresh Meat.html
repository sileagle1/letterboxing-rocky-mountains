                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm starting a series called "West Elk Loop."  I've prepared most of them; when I'm finished up, I hope to begin placing them in May.  It's a series that starts in Carbondale, then takes you down to Redstone, Paonia, Black Mesa, up to Crested Butte, and back up to Carbondale.  There will be lots and lots!!<br/>
<br/>
  I went ahead and placed the first one in the series - a hitch hiker hostel!  I just LOVE those!  It's chock full of HH's waiting to be wisked away.  You'll find the clues to it on LBNA in Garfield county.<br/>
<br/>
  Hope some of you can visit it soon and get some HH's exchanged!<br/>
