July 12th for lunch sounds great now that you've a confirmed date!  <br/>
I'll toss something up on AQ Events page so folks can sign up and we'll <br/>

With the holiday week next week I bet lots of folks will be traveling, <br/>
boxing, etc and wanted to give more "heads up" than usual this time.<br/>
<br/>
Sooo...may I please ask that you stop by the event page to add, drop, <br/>
modify your RSVPs no later than **end-of-day Monday July 6th** so I can <br/>
call the restaurant and make a reservation based on our #s.<br/>
<br/>
Unless the #s go up dramatically I have a place in mind in Uptown <br/>
called The Tavern with a lovely patio and garden that should do the <br/>
trick for lunch, exchanges, etc.  Current info to be added to AQ event <br/>
page as things develop.<br/>
