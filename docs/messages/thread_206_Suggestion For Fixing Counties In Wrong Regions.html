                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am currently in the process of asking the webmasters to<br>
completely redo the Regions of Texas to a scheme that<br>
most of my Texas peers have agreed upon, and to do this<br>
I was sent a spreadsheet to update and send back to the<br>
webmasters.  While updating it I have noticed many errors<br>
that never showed up because no boxes have been placed<br>
in those counties yet, so not only am I creating new Regions,<br>
I am correcting many errors, too.  It occurred to me that<br>
this might be a good way for you in Colorado to get your<br>
counties fixed, even if you don't want to change the Regions.<br>
I suggest one of you ask the webmasters for the Colorado<br>
spreadsheet, update it and send it back.  No guarantee that<br>
anything will be done, but it is still better than asking<br>
for one county to be moved each time you discover an error.<br>
On another note, I hope one of you will find my Grand Lake<br>
box soon and let me know if it survived the winter.  Once<br>
again I find myself wishing I could transport to some of my<br>
letterboxes and enjoy the area all over again any time I want!<br>

   That is a good idea. As for Colorado, I think it might be easier <br>
to just combine "Western Slope" and "High Country". I think most of <br>
the boxes in the state will  be along the Front Range anyway, and it <br>
is hard to come up with a dividing line that makes sense. A case in <br>
point is the division between Esmerelda's new series. They are pretty <br>
closely spaced, but because they are on the line they are listed in <br>
different areas. I am just throwing this out to hopefully start a <br>
discussion, there may be points that I haven't considered. <br>
<br>
    As for your other conundrum. I think the best solution to that is <br>
another road trip to the Rockies! Whenever you do that, make sure and <br>
let someone know, maybe we can throw together a gathering or at least <br>
an exchange.<br>

Another suggestion would be to just divide the state into<br>
four quadrants (Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest).<br>
I know most people that don't live in Colorado have no idea<br>
where Front Range or Western Slope or High Country is supposed<br>
to be.  Everything in Colorado is High Country!  Far be it for<br>
me, an outsider, to suggest how you divide up your regions, but<br>
just thought I would give some input.  I think it is a great<br>
idea for ya'll to discuss this and I wish the Main Talklist <br>
would get back to similar discussions.<br>

    I could vote for that. But I would like to hear from some other <br>
people on this list. Arizona and Utah have all boxes listed together; <br>
is that becoming too much as more boxes are planted? Idaho, Montana, <br>
Wyoming and New Mexico are divided into regions. How is that working <br>
for you folks? <br>

what would work best.  My first reaction is to think front <br>
range/western slope. <br>
I actually went and changed the county on the third one in my series <br>
to make it show up with the others.  I had a note from a family on <br>
vacation that had stopped in Glenwood to box and had no the third box <br>
existed because it was listed in another area on the Colorado map.<br>
