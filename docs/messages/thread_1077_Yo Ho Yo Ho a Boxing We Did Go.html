stamps and some new clues. <br>
It was a gorgeous, perfecto, pirate lovin' day in Western Colorado!  <br>
We stopped at Silt for PRE's Ruler of the Schoolyard.  I played with <br>
the box while Skeetch metal detected across the street (he found <br>
three cents!).  Then on up to Glenwood Canyon to visit PRE's No Name <br>
and check on Grizzly Creek.  So fun to read the entries!  Backtrack <br>
and head up to Marble.<br>
We passed Redstone and stopped for Fairy Moon by Ravenwolf.  I <br>
clambered up the slope with my best pirate clambering skills.. <br>
immediately spied the box, snagged it and sat down to proceed.  As I <br>
opened it up, my first thought was surprise that Ravenwolf had used a <br>
lined wire notebook....instantly after which I thought, 'what's all <br>
this JUNK doing in here?!' and as my light bulb flickered on I <br>
hollered to Skeetch, 'This is a GEOCACHE!'.  Well!  How RUDE!   I <br>
flipped through the book, but didn't leave a note.. no sense in them <br>
knowing the letterbox is nearby!  But.. how could they miss.. because <br>
it's 18 inches away!!!  Oh my heck!  And Fairy Moon was totally <br>
uncovered.. just tossed into it's hole.  I figure the geocachers have <br>
seen it, grabbed it, read the 'letterbox' title on the outside and <br>
just tossed it back into it's hole.  One of the cachers had stamped <br>
in.  I LOVE your journal, Ravenwolf!  Beautifimous!  And I rehid it <br>
reeeeally well.  No way is a cacher going to see it before they see <br>
the cache.  The cache is way obvious.  I also wrote on the outside of <br>
the bag, 'This is not a geocache!'.  <br>
Then on down the road to Marble where Zebediah Gump: The Crystal <br>
found a new home.  We hadn't been up there since we originally <br>
planted it which was just a month short of two years ago.  Oh my <br>
HECK.. the marble operation is in full swing and the parking area is <br>
stacked way high with 37,000 pound blocks of marble!  What a sight <br>
that was!  We were looking for a spot and spied a Marmot sunning on a <br>
rock.. I grabbed Skeetch and said we were going the other way!! NO <br>
marmots!<br>
Then a lovely drive home and.. life.. she is good!<br>

Were we the last ones to stamp into Fairy Moon?  We also had found that<br>
geocache and the letterbox wasn't hidden very well either.  At that<br>
point, we rehid Fairy Moon extremely deep and well.  The geocache was the<br>
most obvious thing and we figured that nobody would dig up Fairy Moon<br>
unless they were really looking for it.  If we were the last letter<br>
boxers to stamp in, then some of these geocachers aren't very good at<br>
finding the obvious box.  I hope it stays safe!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">And.... a boxing we did go today also!!!!! Kenna finally came home <br>
yesterday from the coast and was able to go and play this afternoon, <br>
yay! We first went out and hiked up to PRE's "BMAO in Moab" and had <br>
a wonderful time stamping in. The trail was very busy because of all <br>
the jeep safari visitors this weekend. The directions were very fun <br>
to follow and went past a huge brilliant red patch of flowering <br>
cactus, gorgeous! People were looking at us funny as we hiked past <br>
them on the way up, and then hiked back by them while following the <br>
directions back down the hill. Wonderful spot and box.<br>
<br>
Then we went back to town for drinks and picked up Aspen for the <br>
trek north to "Thompson Canyon" and beyond to the clever "Just Say <br>
Go" boxes. It was super busy up those canyons and people were <br>
camping nearby the Just Say Go box. We chatted with them for a while <br>
and found out they were from Es's neck of the woods. While we were <br>
up the trail stamping in, they hid some eggs for Aspen and we had a <br>
fun egg hunt when we came back down. They were the nicest people!<br>
<br>
All in all, a fantastic day to be out and about! Awww, sigh......<br>

honestly can't remember if it was before or after you!  What a <br>
dweeb.. you'd think I would have paid attention!<br>
We shoved it waaay back in the hole and totally covered it with rocks <br>
and sticks and leaves (just like I'm positive you did).  <br>
How could the cachers miss the one below it that sticks out like a <br>
sore thumb? They need some pinching!!<br>
Ravenwolf.. if you want me to move it a little further away let me <br>
know and the next time we're up there we'll take care of it. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, PRE, I have to say THANKS, THANKS THANKS!!!  While in CA, I had <br>
a fistful of clues, and all the excitement in the world to find new <br>
boxes (especially ones that Kat doesn't have!! He, he!).  I ventured <br>
out, dragged my parents along, and found exactly. . . NONE!  That's <br>
right!  Not ONE box was there.  I should've had at least 7 new <br>
stamps to come home with, and came home with zero.  I was so sad.  <br>
It's not that I didn't try.  I went to every spot, looked under <br>
every rock, bush, tree, people's feet, I could find.  I came home <br>
and told Kat my sad story, and she cheered me up when she told me <br>
PRE had left 3. . .count 'em, THREE. . .new boxes out there within <br>
arm's reach!  YAY!  <br>
We had to rush out and find them.  (Good thing the FF's were still <br>
there.  With Jeep Safari in town, Kat was worried other LBers came <br>
and got them before we did.  She was kind enough to wait until I got <br>
home, but told me that if the FF's were gone, she's going without me <br>
next time!  Yikes!)<br>
So, I'm glad you had such a great trip, and I'm glad you were able <br>
to plant some.  Sounds like we're going to have to make a trip out <br>
to CO sometime soon, though.  There's a treasure trove of boxes just <br>
waiting for us!<br>

weekend.  It rained all day Easter, and then this morning, I woke up to<br>
several inches of snow!!  Yes, snow.  Wet, heavy, slushy snow and lots of<br>
it.  Welcome to spring in Idaho!  I want to go letterboxing!!<br>
<br>
Better yet, I want to go back to Wales, but that's another story.  Thank you<br>
all, by the way for your well-wishes.  They made me smile.  And no, we don't<br>
have a spare bedroom just yet.  His flat is small, but there's an okay futon<br>
in the living room.  No letterboxes out there yet though.  I'll have to<br>
plant a few!<br>

I think it was the Catamounts who dropped us a note that the Fairy <br>
had roomates. Nice to know she is still there - and thank you! I love <br>
that journal. Everything came together just right.<br>
<br>
My clan is actually going to be in the Glenwood area the weekend of <br>
May 12, and we are planning on moving that box to a different <br>
location near the waterfall to avoid further confusion. Thanks so <br>
much for thinking of us, we really appreciate your offer, Es! I would <br>
hate to lose that box. Sounds like too many of our Colorado boxes <br>
have walked away recently. My sympathy to the Catamounts. We have <br>
retrieved both the Dilbox and Super Uno Guy. Both are in fantastic <br>
locations.<br>
<br>
You gotta watch those marmots. They were all over when we went to <br>
stamp into your box in marble!<br>
<br>
Cadenza: Congrats, congrats! How wonderfully exciting for you! "May <br>
you live as long as you'd like, and love as long as you live." -<br>

I'm shocked that Dilbox went missing. It was in a fantastic location <br>
and I can't imagine someone rooting around in there accidentally. <br>
Even being seen by someone else is pretty unlikely. You had a great <br>
view of anyone heading your direction. I'm glad you'll be replacing <br>
it.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That makes sense! We were there in the summer time and the foliage <br>
was thick!<br>
<br>
It's always interesting how the scenery changes with the seasons. We <br>
were at a box up in the Pagosa Springs area, and it was placed in <br>
winter - no foliage. When we came to get it in the spring, the clues <br>
refered to landmarks that were much harder to see when the trees had <br>
leafed out.<br>
<br>
We'll be sure to head back when you get it in its new spot. Little <br>
Wolf has especially enjoyed finding your boxes. =3<br>
