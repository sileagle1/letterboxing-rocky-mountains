Weather in Moab in early April is always an iffy thing. There can be <br>
as much as 60 degree changes from early morning to night. It is <br>
usually pretty darn nice that time of year, although last year at <br>
that time we did get some snow! Layers are always good, but <br>
definitely bring some shorts! It is stormy and the rims are covered <br>
in snow right now, but day before yesterday was shorts and t-shirt <br>
weather.<br>
<br>
Annnd remember, it's not how many miles you travel, but how many <br>
boxes you can find on the way!!!!!!!<br>
