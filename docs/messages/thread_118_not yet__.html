                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, so today the snow stuck and now the roads are sheer ice.  It is so<br/>
slick.  I was excited to try out my new all-weather tires, but not like<br/>
this!  Ironically, the snow yesterday came from the north and was supposed<br/>
to stay in the mountains around Yellowstone, but the snow today came from<br/>
Salt Lake City's direction.  I heard they were hit today too.  Ours really<br/>
wasn't deep at all and will melt with a little warmth, but it is wicked cold<br/>
with blustering winds and the roads are just sheets of ice.  I love snow and<br/>
changing seasons, but I prefer the gentle, powdery snow falling around<br/>
lights (straight out of a Christmas card).  I don't like it when it comes in<br/>
bitter and biting like this.  -and why is it that my motivation to get out<br/>
and letterbox suddenly shot up when I just can't fair the cold, blowing wind<br/>
and ice?<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, we need the moisture for the farms out here, so it's a good thing I<br/>
guess.<br/>
