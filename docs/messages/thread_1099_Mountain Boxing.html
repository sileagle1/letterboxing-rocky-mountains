Es - Doc Holiday is looking good. The whole space is just wonderfully <br>
serene. The box and everything in it look good! Love the journal and <br>
the stamp to that one! I think they are some of my favorites. But, ya <br>
know, all of your stuff is good, so there ya go!<br>
<br>
We also picked up both of Art Trekker's stamps, which are lovely.<br>
<br>
The Fairy Moon box has been moved. Thank you to everyone who warned us <br>
about her new neighbors. She has taken up a spot on the other side of <br>
the waterfall, and I will change the clues accordingly.<br>

thanks so much for the update!  I love that cemetary and Doc's grave.<br>
