                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is just a reminder that the Healing Angel postal letterbox is now open for sign ups!  To get on the list to receive this box, email me reciept of donation to a disater relief organization of your choice...  I am not concrete on wanting a copy of the reciept.  I trust that the fine folks in this group will make a donation if they say that they have or will.  Need ideas on where to donate?  Check FEMA's website or the Red Cross site.<br>
 <br>
The stamp isn't quite done - the design is done, it's a beauty!  I hope to get it carved up tomorrow.  I meant to get it done tonight but left my carving block at home.  *rolls eyes*  Can't keep my stuff together.  As soon as it is done I will get it off the the first person on the list.  <br>
 <br>
Tell EVERYONE that you know about this box and let's make this list a long one!!!!  <br>
 <br>
Thanks!<br>

My whole family emptied our pockets into a red cross bowl Friday night. My daughter started it and we all followed her lead. <br>
 <br>
I also sell Home Interiors and Gifts. We have joined with Thomas Kincade and came out with a candle jar which features his Light in the Storm print. All the proceeds of this candle will go to the relief fund. We have projected selling one million jars in two weeks. Woo hooo! <br>
 <br>
I want to remind folks that all these people will also need clothes. If you have any GOOD clothes to donate I think the salvation army will accept them and get them to the needy folks that lost everything. On my WW board we are all gathering up plus size clothes. But childrens clothes are needed too. <br>
 <br>
Now... what do I need to do to get on your list? <br>
 <br>
Kris and family! <br>
