We finally got the approval for the Cu letterbox - so it is alive and <br/>
well and back out in the field.<br/>
<br/>
I spoke with one of the people from JeffCo, and asked if it was <br/>
easier for them if we put out a box, then let them find it and <br/>
approve it, then publish clues - OR was it easier to find a spot, ask <br/>
for approval, obtain it, then put the box out. She said that it <br/>
didn't matter either way. She said that if you have a good spot, <br/>
sometimes it is easier if the box is already there, so they can get a <br/>
good look at its location before approving it. So, the good news is <br/>
that you can place a box and then ask for permission, but if they <br/>
tell you that its location is no good, you have to go back out and <br/>
move it, but if they approve it - it's already there and you don't <br/>
have to worry about it.<br/>
<br/>
Also went and got the Castlewood Canyon box (the one that the <br/>
Castlewood Canyon Park put out) very cool little hike! We had never <br/>
been there before and were pleasantly surprised at the location - <br/>
very scenic!<br/>
