experiences:<br/>
<br/>
i thoroughly enjoyed the great LB in your area.  thanks to you and <br/>
all the LBer's in your area for creating such great lb!  if you  are <br/>
ever down this way (cincinnati) let me know and i will hook you up <br/>
with a trip itinerary where you can box your heart out.<br/>
<br/>
3 days all shortened by afternoon rain, about 40 miles hiked, 2300' <br/>
elevation gain total, 17 boxes gotten (9 misses) and 2 HH - all from <br/>
the greater denver vicinity.  <br/>
<br/>
particularly notable stamps by esmerelda (little raven, buffalo bill <br/>
cody lb).  <br/>
<br/>
scariest hike - rain cloud lb which is located along dinosaur <br/>
ridge.  the clues say 30 minutes up to the box, but i went way <br/>
beyond that and still no box.  there is supposed to be a trail that <br/>
splits to the left and everytime i dared to look that way it went <br/>
straight down to the valley floor.  eventually reached the<br/>
summit and got too squeamish to continue (remember i am a <br/>
flatlander) and called it quits.  i suspect that i was too <br/>
preoccupied with DYING to scrupulously look for the box.  the <br/>
mountain bikers flying down the hill did NOT make me feel all<br/>
that safe.  <br/>
<br/>
the REAL rattlesnakes in rattlesnake gulch LB area were also quite <br/>
notable!<br/>
<br/>
all-in-all maybe not the most numbers ( i have on a few occasions <br/>
gotten that many in 1 day!), but a great variety and types of <br/>
letterboxes and some breathtaking hikes - literally.  you are very <br/>
fortunate to live in such a gorgeous location.  i LOVED the open <br/>
spaces and how they have been interconnected.  <br/>
<br/>
again thanks to you and your local LBers for such a challenging trip<br/>

how to visit Colorado!<br/>

Clueless and I found that box this past Thursday. We blew past the <br/>
sidetrail on our climb up, but found it on our way back down. There <br/>
were lots of mountain bikers and a couple of runners on the trail, <br/>
but the views from the top were terrific!<br/>
