Hey Es, what highways are you taking to see Mickey? We were on hwys. <br>
40 and 15 last week and there are quite a few out there. Let me know <br>
and I'll see if I can tell you what I've found out there! You know, <br>
if you drove through Moab on the way, I'd be more than happy to help <br>
with some of those pies! LOL<br>
<br>
thinking of leftovers that I didn't have,<br>

I'm actually cheating and flying to Phoenix, so any pie eating will <br>
be done at 15,000 feet.  I'll have a moment of silence when we shoot <br>
over Moab.  You know, I'll stop chewing for like, 3 seconds.  And <br>
have the pilot dip a wing. <br>
<br>
We're taking highway 10 pretty much all the way from there to the <br>
mouse.  Singing pirate songs all the way.<br>
<br>
Es, who's Thanksgiving leftovers came in little foil packets on the <br>
plane that said, 'pretzels'<br>
