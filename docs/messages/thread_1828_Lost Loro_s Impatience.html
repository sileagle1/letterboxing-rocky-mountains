Like many of you who've posted already - I had trouble even locating the CLUES for this one!  Simply searching under mystery, mystery brings up a bazillion clues (which is why I didn't even know this box existed before the post).  But I found the clues.  Here's a hint:  Lost Loro is not part of the name of the box, it's the trail name of the planter.<br/>

p.s. Darryl - if you want more folks to find your box - "mystery, mystery" locations are tough because they dont show up on any searches for local boxes.  Good clues, though - and I can totally see from them why you listed it that way!  :)  I just never ever search for mystery, mystery boxes myself because half the time the box ends up being in Connecticut.  :-P<br/>

Since your clue says it's OK to offer advice, why not make the state<br/>
location = Colorado?  Still a mystery, but it will pique the interest of<br/>
the right population.<br/>

Thanks for the advice.  It's much appreciated.  I didn't mention the box name on purpose to give people somewhat of a challenge.  I guess that backfired.  When you find the stamp, you'll see that I need a lot more help, but I'll eventually get it.  I recently planted one in Calif. which will be more straight forward.<br/>
As for the food, try the taco salad or fajitas.  To save money, listen to 100.3 FM - MIX 100 for half-price deals.  I worked there 15 years ago and loved it.  I hope that some of you enjoy the hunt.  The building is very interesting with hidden gems everywhere.<br/>

&gt; Hey BoxerLover ...<br/>
&gt; I searched high and low in the management tools section of yahoo<br/>
groups and cannot discover a way to make the system accept rich text. I<br/>
think Yahoo is just not that sopisitcated. Maybe I'm wrong.<br/>
&gt; Any of the other moderators out there want to take a peek?<br/>

this and my previous message in Comic Sans MS  and will sign my name in<br/>
