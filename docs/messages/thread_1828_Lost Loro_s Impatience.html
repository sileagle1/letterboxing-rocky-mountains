Like many of you who've posted already - I had trouble even locating the CLUES for this one!  Simply searching under mystery, mystery brings up a bazillion clues (which is why I didn't even know this box existed before the post).  But I found the clues.  Here's a hint:  Lost Loro is not part of the name of the box, it's the trail name of the planter.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Autumnsfolly<br>
<br>
p.s. Darryl - if you want more folks to find your box - "mystery, mystery" locations are tough because they dont show up on any searches for local boxes.  Good clues, though - and I can totally see from them why you listed it that way!  :)  I just never ever search for mystery, mystery boxes myself because half the time the box ends up being in Connecticut.  :-P<br>

Since your clue says it's OK to offer advice, why not make the state<br>
location = Colorado?  Still a mystery, but it will pique the interest of<br>
the right population.<br>

mystery" locations are tough because they dont show up on any searches<br>
for local boxes.  Good clues, though - and I can totally see from them<br>
why you listed it that way!  :)  I just never ever search for mystery,<br>
mystery boxes myself because half the time the box ends up being in<br>
Connecticut.  :-P<br>
<br>
Since your clue says it's OK to offer advice, why not make the state<br>
location = Colorado?  Still a mystery, but it will pique the interest of<br>
the right population.<br>

Thanks for the advice.  It's much appreciated.  I didn't mention the box name on purpose to give people somewhat of a challenge.  I guess that backfired.  When you find the stamp, you'll see that I need a lot more help, but I'll eventually get it.  I recently planted one in Calif. which will be more straight forward.<br>
As for the food, try the taco salad or fajitas.  To save money, listen to 100.3 FM - MIX 100 for half-price deals.  I worked there 15 years ago and loved it.  I hope that some of you enjoy the hunt.  The building is very interesting with hidden gems everywhere.<br>

When you are posting a message on the message board, just above the<br>
"To:", you'll see the  option "Compose your message with Rich-Text<br>

To properly see this type of message, you may also need to go to "Edit<br>

Message Preference to Fully Featured New & Improved!<br>
<br>
<br>

Hope this might help!<br>

However, I poked around on a couple of the Yahoo  groups for which I am<br>
a moderator and I can't find any setting that  routinely allows the<br>
rich-text editor.  WH, I did use the link you  mentioned to write both<br>
this and my previous message in Comic Sans MS  and will sign my name in<br>
red.  I have changed my message preference to fully-featured this time<br>
to see if that makes a difference (although I am traditional on all<br>
other Yahoo boards and they work OK).  Let's see if it works this time.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, I will contact the owner of another Yahoo group who is much<br>
smarter than I am about how this board/computer stuff works and see if<br>
she can point me in the right direction.<br>
