                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was a bright and sunny dayyes, sunny!  Cappy and Peach grabbed <br/>
some eats and went off into the daylight to hunt for boxes.  This <br/>
after planting one of their own at the base of Winter Park the day <br/>
before.  The SKI TRAIN letterbox holds a special fondness for them, <br/>
wellfind the box and you'll know why!  They needed to photocopy the <br/>
clues, which were hand written on five pages of hotel note pad <br/>
paper, for the others meeting at the Grand, Grand gathering and <br/>
stopped in town at the copy store.  The store was busy with activity <br/>
but a girl asked if she could help them.  They asked to use a copier <br/>
and she gave them the key for one of the two in the shop.   A <br/>
strange man was using one copier immediately next to the one they <br/>
were to use.  He appeared to be filling an order for another <br/>
customer.  As Cappy and Peach approached the available one, he <br/>
reached out and asked for the key and pushed his assistance on <br/>
them.  When he asked them for the paper that needed copying, he <br/>
grabbed at the clues and actually tried to start reading them!  <br/>
Cappy quickly, but politely, took them back and placed them face <br/>
down on the printer.  They took one copy and discovered that the <br/>
pages weren't quite in order.  Peach asked them to rearrange two of <br/>
the pages. The man, AGAIN, tried to read them as he took over moving <br/>
the pages.  Peach wasn't happy and the DREAD started rising to the <br/>
surface!  ARRRRRR!  She wanted to pull out her cutlass and tie a <br/>
scarf around his peeping eyes and his hands behind his head!  NO <br/>
PEEPING!!!  Needless to say, Cappy quickly finished up the copying <br/>
so they could get out of there, knowing Irish Peach could get pushed <br/>
past the Dread point!  Peach snatched her precious clues from the <br/>
man and they paid for their goods and got out of the shop, feeling <br/>
his peeping eyes following them as they left!<br/>
<br/>
They cursed the man and wondered why he was so brazen as to attempt <br/>
to read their personal papers!  After a bit of discussion, a light <br/>
went off in their head!  Could it be?  Was it one of the men that <br/>
were after Kyle Fincher???  Oh my gosh!  If you don't know who Kyle <br/>
is, you MUST find the "RED" letterbox to learn his tale!  As they <br/>
drove out of town, they kept their eyes peeled for a green Bronco!<br/>
<br/>
That was strange!  But, not as strange as THE STRANGEST BIRD <br/>
letterbox they stopped for on the way.  You learn something new <br/>
every day, even with bad guys on your tail!  When they made one last <br/>
stop, at GRAND LAKE letterbox, their hearts went cold when the tree <br/>
that it was hidden near was chopped to the ground.the men after <br/>
Fincher, again?  Will they stop at nothing!  Then, as they looked <br/>
out onto the Lake they shivered as the spirits of, SPIRIT LAKE, THE <br/>
COMMISSIONER, AND MOMMY DEAREST took form and seemed to reach out to <br/>
them.  Cappy and Peach had signed into their logbooks sometime ago <br/>
and felt themselves being pulled towards the other side of the lake <br/>
and the gathering!  As they headed towards the gathering, they felt <br/>
the presence of...a munching moose!  DREAD!  <br/>
<br/>
Stay tune for Part Three:  THE GATHERING and is that a DOG, Little <br/>
Wolf???<br/>
