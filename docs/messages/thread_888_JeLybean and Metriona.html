Okay JeLy, <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I have questions for you!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 FIRST, what do you do for a living? I have not gone looking for your letter boxes because I was intimidated by your clues.. but believe me I am ready and Maggie will be our first. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
SECOND, when looking in the files for the patch idea I was looking at the other files. I saw your metriona. HUH??? Number and symbols? Anyway, I printed it off and gave it to my daughter's 16 year old boyfriend to play with and he figured it out today. Have others figured it out? So he also asked if you were a linguist or just interested in linguistics? <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I am thinking I am not smart enough to play LBing  with you but I am gonna try! <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You've got questions, I've got answers.  Sort of.<br>
<br>
First, if I told you what I do for a living it might reveal my <br>
superhero secret identity, and the world would suffer as a result.  <br>
Suffice to say, I do many things these days, but my college degree <br>
is in rocket science.  No kidding.<br>
<br>
And come on... aren't you being a little unfair labeling my clues <br>
intimidating?  I consider myself an equal opportunity clue-giver; <br>
some may be harder than others, but there's fun for all brains!  <br>
Some of my favorites, like Pulpit Rock and Ute Pass don't really <br>
require any solving at all, they simply provide directions to the <br>
box.  The hardest part about boxes like those is the hike.   <br>
<br>
Second, Metriona: yes, others have figured it out.  In fact, many <br>
millions of people have potentially solved Metriona since it was <br>
first solved around 1843.  A few brilliant minds, such as y-nought <br>
and apparently your daughter's boyfriend, have solved it from <br>
scratch, which impresses me.  This however is not necessary, since, <br>
as the LbNA web page (http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?<br>
boxnum=15129&boxname=Metriona_Bicolor) states, the clues have <br>
already been solved for you and you just have to talk to the right <br>
person for the key.  But you know, that y-nought is always trying to <br>
impress people.  And he succeeds.<br>
<br>
No, I am not a linguist nor do I have any major interest in <br>
linguistics.  But then again, I am not the developer of the Metriona <br>
clues; that was a mind far greater than mine.<br>
<br>
And finally, yes, you ARE smart enough to play letterboxing with <br>
me!  None of my clues really require intuitive leaps, flashes of <br>
genius, or deep thought.  They're just puzzles or plays on words, <br>
and even the harder of them typically employ something like a well-<br>
known cypher technique and only require doing a little research and <br>
recognizing a pattern.  Now Mapsurfer's boxes... I wonder if ANYone <br>
is smart enough to play letterboxing with him.<br>
<br>
