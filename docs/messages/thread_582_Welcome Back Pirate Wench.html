Es, you're just going to have to come and play with us. Cough, cough, <br/>
don't you feel a bit of something coming on? Hmmmm, better call in <br/>
sick on the 10th, don't want to pass any spring fever or worse, boxing <br/>
fever(to which is chronic and doesn't go away), onto those poor <br/>
unsuspecting passengers!<br/>
<br/>
Y, I think your list is looking pretty good. My head is swimming with <br/>
trail names and real names, aaaaaa!<br/>
<br/>
This is so exciting and I just keep checking the site to see all the <br/>
new postings!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Easter everyone! I hope everyone gets out there and boxes on <br/>
this beautiful day! I have a new box to plant this afternoon!!! Jeep <br/>
Safari is over and the 4-wheeler assault on town is ending! They <br/>
brought in highway patrol helicopters to enforce the back country this <br/>
year, and my house sits in between two major trails that they patrol. <br/>
So all week they have buzzed over my house and the canyon behind my <br/>
house just barely clearing the top of the canyon. I feel like its been <br/>
a war zone all week!<br/>
