(and that's enough posts from me before I kill a cat) -if any don't <br/>
know, that was a reference, not a call to violence.  I don't kill cats, <br/>
though I'm often tempted.  I'm really a dog kind of person. :-)<br/>

Good morning! Cadenza is right: if you search from the main <br/>
yahoogroups homepage our list shouldn't show up because of that <br/>
setting. It's easy to change it: <br/>
<br/>
-go to the home page at<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/RMLetterboxing<br/>
<br/>
-click "management" in the left column, then<br/>
-click "Description &amp; Appearance" under "Group Settings" on the right<br/>
-click "edit" under the "Directory" setting, and you can choose what <br/>
category to put us under. Most of the letterboxing lists are in <br/>
Outdoors&gt;Letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I think the new file Randy put up on the big list will help people <br/>
find us as well, and there's no reason we couldn't drop a little <br/>
reminder to the list every now and then.<br/>
<br/>
Happy day, it's "Friday" for us and we're looking forward to a long <br/>
weekend, Jay in CT<br/>

<br/>
The regional letterboxing groups have really only begun to take off in the <br/>
last few months. In fact, only a couple of days ago I added links to all <br/>
the regional letterboxing groups to my web site, thinking that many people <br/>
didn't know about them:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/links_groups.shtml<br/>
<br/>
I'll post a message to the main talk list and maybe that will bring some <br/>
new members to this group.<br/>
