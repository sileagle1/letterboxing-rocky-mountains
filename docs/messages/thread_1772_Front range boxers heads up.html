The article is not online, in the RHweekly for here in Loveland. The Article in my opinion is very well done, however the pictures she posted and the underwriting in the pictures gives a lot away. I let her take a picture of a box I planted just for her to find and then moved the box.<br>
<br>
The pictures she posted, she didn't take pictures of the actual boxes but she gave names and locations, I want to make sure you all knew about which ones she talked about and if they didn't have permission to be in these areas you need to know.<br>
<br>
The boxes are: Coyote Ridge, Gray wolf in Colorado, Bivouac site at Pawnee Buttes, and the entire series of the Seven Treasures of the high plains.<br>
<br>
I hope you all can take action to protect your boxes.<br>
Again I am sorry, the only thing she sent me for proof reading was the actual article and not the pictures.<br>

Okay so there was a reporter. I talked to her, because I knew she was going to do the article anyway. The article is not online, in the RHweekly for here in Loveland. The Article in my opinion is very well done, however the pictures she posted and the underwriting in the pictures gives a lot away.
