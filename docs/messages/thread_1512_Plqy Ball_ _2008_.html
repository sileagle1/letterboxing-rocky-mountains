up" this year when I placed it.<br>
<br>
For those of you who've found it in PREvious years (and log online), <br>
it's probably off your radar screen because you've found it already.<br>
<br>
Count it as a new find or not, I don't care.  In any case, my reason <br>
for posting this reminder is that no matter how you count it, this box <br>
has a *NEW STAMP each year.*<br>
<br>
Have fun.<br>
