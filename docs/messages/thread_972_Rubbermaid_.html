Calling Rubbermaid is true dedication. I salute you. In a cool<br>
<br>
pirate kind of way, of course.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm still going to check the local stores.. we have some old hardware<br>
<br>
stores and neighborhood grocery stores in the area and, who knows,<br>
<br>
just maybe they'll have a dusty stash of them just waiting to be<br>
<br>
discovered. Pirates love looking for treasure. And they really like<br>
<br>
ransoming things, too. Because, come on! That's how they get half<br>
<br>
of their cool stuff!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have a super coolio little lok n lok box sent to me by the<br>
<br>
Catamount Carvers. It may meet your criteria. I haven't found any<br>
<br>
exactly like it yet, but I bet they know where they be! Garrr!<br>
<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks FRH, that'd be great!  A certain awesome pirate I know traded <br>
a keg of rum to some unsavory types in the Carribean for some boxes, <br>
so I have a few, but could always use more.  They'd be 3.5" on top, <br>
and maybe 3" on the bottom.  You say they had "a few" 3-packs... if <br>
it's like 3 or 4 or 5 packs or so, I'd take them all.  If it's like <br>
10 packs, I probably don't need 30 boxes, although JrsyBoy expressed <br>
some interest in them, and I could probably send him some.  I'm <br>
happy to pay for both the boxes and postage.  Email me off list and <br>
we'll arrange a transfer.<br>
