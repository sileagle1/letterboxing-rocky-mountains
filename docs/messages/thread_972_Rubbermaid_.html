                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks FRH, that'd be great!  A certain awesome pirate I know traded <br/>
a keg of rum to some unsavory types in the Carribean for some boxes, <br/>
so I have a few, but could always use more.  They'd be 3.5" on top, <br/>
and maybe 3" on the bottom.  You say they had "a few" 3-packs... if <br/>
it's like 3 or 4 or 5 packs or so, I'd take them all.  If it's like <br/>
10 packs, I probably don't need 30 boxes, although JrsyBoy expressed <br/>
some interest in them, and I could probably send him some.  I'm <br/>
happy to pay for both the boxes and postage.  Email me off list and <br/>
we'll arrange a transfer.<br/>
