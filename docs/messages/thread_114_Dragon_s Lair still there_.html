You will be happy to hear that the Dragon's Lair is still there!  <br/>
The last seeker who reported it missing, must have been looking in <br/>
the wrong place. I took my Mom up there today and it's exactly where <br/>
it should be and doesn't look like it's been touched since we found <br/>
it in September.  So, just FYI!<br/>

<br/>
I was going to be real bummed if this box went MIA.  I finally got <br/>
around to carving a personal stamp and wanted to hit the boxes I'd <br/>
been to this summer.  Dragon's Lair was one of them :)<br/>
<br/>
Soooo, let the drive begin.<br/>
