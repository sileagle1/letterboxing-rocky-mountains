                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have some days off coming up so am driving to Denver to pick up the <br>
oldest buccaneer and maybe one or two of the small pirates. We're <br>
planning on driving up to the renaissance faire in Larkspur, on <br>
through Colorado Springs, into Durango and back. Letterboxing all <br>
along the way. <br>
<br>
I looked at listings in these areas and a lot of them seem like more <br>
of a hike than my 72 year old mother is up to. Can anyone give me a <br>
heads up to which ones might be a good bet for us?<br>
<br>
y-nought...I'm toying with the idea of leaving her with a book <br>
somewhere so I can try to find your Engineer Mountain. hehehe. We'll <br>
see what kind of mood she is in. She absolutely refused to be left <br>
behind when we went to Oregon. fortunately we only got to one spot <br>
where she got stuck. But anything over 45 minutes is beyond her. <br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any suggestions and recommendations!<br>

     Woohoo!  Road Trip!<br>
    <br>
             For the last part of your trip I can say this:<br>
<br>
       Animas Overlook-- short walk on good trail about 5 to 10 <br>
minutes each way, plus about 20 minutes each way driving on gravel <br>
road.<br>
<br>
      Andrews lake-- very short walk. I will be in the wilderness 8 <br>
miles east of here June 24-27.<br>
<br>
     Box Canyon-- Drive By.<br>
<br>
     Engineer Mtn.-- a bit of a hike. There are much worse places to <br>
read a book!<br>
<br>
            And the rest you already know or I'm not tellin'.<br>
  Have a Splendid time with the Buccaneers at the Faire,<br>

Although, isn't it really more like guidelines? ::laughs::<br>
<br>
I've got all these printed out and hopefully will be able to visit <br>
them all. We appreciate the information!<br>
