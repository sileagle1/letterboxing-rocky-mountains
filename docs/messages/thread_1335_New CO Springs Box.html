curiosity killed the cat."  Or maybe I should say y-0.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, for those of you who don't know, the whole discussion about <br/>
Schrodinger came about when team JeLy was planning a trip to take the <br/>
candy wagon down to Pagosa.  We wanted to meet up with y-0 and La <br/>
Paloma, but there was a great deal of uncertainty about that trip <br/>
which led to a silly email exchange about the Heisenberg uncertainty <br/>
principle and Schrodinger's Cat (yes, I'm a science geek), which <br/>
eventually spawned the idea for a letterbox where the stamp is <br/>
unknown until you open it and y-0 coining the phrase "Quantum Catbox."<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, during that trip, I planted the Piedra River hot springs <br/>
box, where y-0 eventually ended up proposing to La Paloma, which <br/>
inspired the creation of yet another letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
You see, it's all related.  Perhaps I need another letterbox, this <br/>
one dedicated to Jung's principle of Synchonicity.  Perhaps I could <br/>
work that Police song into it somehow.  I'm digging bands more like <br/>
Coldplay these days, but the Police were great in their day.<br/>
