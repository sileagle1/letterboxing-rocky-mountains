                    <div class="plaintext-content">According to Schrodinger, absolutely!  Until anyone actually checks <br>
on it, the cat could be said to be neither dead nor alive, or, <br>
simultaneously both dead and alive.  It will not definitely be either <br>
until you examine it, giving new meaning to the phrase "y-nought's <br>
curiosity killed the cat."  Or maybe I should say y-0.<br>
<br>
BTW, for those of you who don't know, the whole discussion about <br>
Schrodinger came about when team JeLy was planning a trip to take the <br>
candy wagon down to Pagosa.  We wanted to meet up with y-0 and La <br>
Paloma, but there was a great deal of uncertainty about that trip <br>
which led to a silly email exchange about the Heisenberg uncertainty <br>
principle and Schrodinger's Cat (yes, I'm a science geek), which <br>
eventually spawned the idea for a letterbox where the stamp is <br>
unknown until you open it and y-0 coining the phrase "Quantum Catbox."<br>
<br>
Ironically, during that trip, I planted the Piedra River hot springs <br>
box, where y-0 eventually ended up proposing to La Paloma, which <br>
inspired the creation of yet another letterbox.<br>
<br>
You see, it's all related.  Perhaps I need another letterbox, this <br>
one dedicated to Jung's principle of Synchonicity.  Perhaps I could <br>
work that Police song into it somehow.  I'm digging bands more like <br>
Coldplay these days, but the Police were great in their day.<br>
