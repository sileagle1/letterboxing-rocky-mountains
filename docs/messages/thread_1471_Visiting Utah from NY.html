I will be doing a surgical rotation out in Nephi and Gunnison, UT this <br>
coming summer (from around 6/23 - 7/30ish) and I was wondering if there <br>
were any must see areas or boxes that I should try to get while I'm <br>
there - I should have my weekends free. I will be driving out so I'll <br>
have my car while I'm there. Feel free to AQ mail me.<br>

I already suggested Dolphinwanderer plan to visit Moab and SLC.  We'll<br>
set up a mini-meet in SLC for local boxers there.  At one point, 2006?,<br>
I think I had every single box in Moab in my log book and can certainly<br>
recommend my favorites there, but I'm sure there are exceptional<br>
additions since then.  Can you Moabians counsel DW on the best of the<br>
best?<br>
<br>
Oh, I forgot to mention, DW, the key to boxing in Moab in summer is<br>
water, water, water - and sunscreen.  You might also schedule the LaSals<br>
for the heat of the day. [B-)]   Did you guys plant any more boxes up<br>
there?  That would be awesome!<br>
