<br>
Wanted to let you know, I heard from Kathy over at Jeffco on Friday.  Open<br>
space is putting new rules into affect. They are only going to be allowing 2<br>
boxes per open space park (this includes caches) and each person can only<br>
have a total of 5 boxes on all open space.  My 2 boxes I just planted<br>
(Surefooted Ram & Embodiment of Purity) are at a place where there are<br>
already 4 boxes. so, there is a likelihood I will have to remove them.<br>
Kathy said she would get back to me in about 2 weeks when they complete<br>
their new rules and such.<br>
<br>
