had already cut. Someone said to color the surface first to correct<br>
that, but I haven't tried it.<br>
<br>
As for the texture Aljan mentions, you might try this that I used on<br>
some grade B WHITE to turn it into grade A. (I've not tried it on the<br>
ORANGE.) Set you iron somewhere in between rayon/polyester and wool.<br>
Put the PZKut between two sheets of very smooth paper right on the<br>
kitchen counter. Gently press the iron on the top piece of paper. You<br>
don't really need to press; it's the heat that does the work. Try it<br>
just a few seconds and work up to accomplish what you want. Gently<br>
peel the top paper away from the PZKut. The medium first melts a<br>
little and then re-hardens, picking up the smoothness from the paper. <br>
