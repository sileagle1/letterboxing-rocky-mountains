correctly...I'm attempting to post directly to the Yahoo Group this <br/>
time...<br/>
<br/>
Mateys, did you get my earlier post about 'New German'...Aye, I <br/>
could throw myself off the plank for not thinking of it earlier...  <br/>
a new german could be a child...the word in German is kinder. That <br/>
would be a german child, or a 'new german'??? <br/>
<br/>
On the Durango website, there are several references to Kinder <br/>
Morgan, who apparently does quite a bit in those parts of Colorado, <br/>
but it could also be a reference to a Kinder Care, kindergarden, <br/>
etc.  Just a thought, but darned if it didn't keep me up most of the <br/>
night.<br/>
<br/>
Had to laugh because we just finished reading a book with our kids <br/>
called 'The prisoners of the Sea' which was full of pirates and the <br/>
like hunting treasure.  <br/>
<br/>
RRR, I can smeall the treasure already....she says with one eye <br/>
closed.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting...Sush (Colorado Boxtops)<br/>
