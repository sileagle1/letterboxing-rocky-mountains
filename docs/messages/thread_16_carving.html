I found a great Speedball set at Meininger's.  It's an art supply <br/>
store in Denver (not a hobby store ... a REAL artists supply store)  <br/>
I'm not sure what's in C. Springs.  Many of these items are available <br/>
online to purchase, though.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you type speedball tool into a google search you'll find <br/>
sites that sell them.  I bought a big block of mastercarve relatively <br/>
cheap, but prior to that I've been using those inexpensive <br/>
rectangular white erasers.  Some speedball sets come with "the pink <br/>
stuff" which is easy to carve, but I haven't been able to find it <br/>
sold seperately from the tools.<br/>

&gt; I'm trying! <br/>
&gt; No really, I've been following the main board thread about carving <br/>
quite closely. I went to Michaels, explained that I wanted to make my <br/>
own stamp. Let just say that NOTHING they sold me works. So, back to <br/>
finding speedball.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any clues on where in CO carving materials are hidden? I was <br/>
thinking about doing Hobby Lobby next. Their lines down here stink, <br/>
so I usually avoid it except for major sales.<br/>
