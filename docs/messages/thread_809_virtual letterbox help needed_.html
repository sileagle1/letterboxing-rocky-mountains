This is the first of what we hope to be a series of virtual letterboxes that celebrate America's National Parks. This park has the distinction of being a World Heritage site and a Biosphere Reserve. Yellowstone was the first park to be designated as a National Park.  It seems fitting that it is the site of our first letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues are below--good luck and happy hunting<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. The highest elevation  at over 11 thousand feet is called ________. The mystery word's first letter is the first letter of the second word.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Yellowstone is home to the bald eagle, grizzly bear and lynx.  These animals are _______. The mystery word's second letter is the fifth letter of this word.<br/>
<br/>
3. The park is larger than Delaware and which other state put together? The mystery word's third letter is the first letter of the second word.<br/>
<br/>
4. Ninety six percent of the park is within which state? The mystery word's fourth letter in the sixth letter of this word.<br/>
<br/>
5. Yellowstone's most notable geothermal feature erupts about every 90 minutes. The mystery word's fifth letter is the fourth letter of the second word.<br/>
<br/>
6. Animals with endangered status who make their home within Yellowstone are the Gray Wolf and the ____________. The mystery word's sixth letter is the fifth letter of the first word.<br/>
<br/>
7. The park is home to a petrified one of these. The mystery word's seventh letter is this word's second letter.<br/>
<br/>
8. There are approximately two thousand of these per year in the park. The mystery word's last two letters are the fourth and eleventh letters of this word.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
