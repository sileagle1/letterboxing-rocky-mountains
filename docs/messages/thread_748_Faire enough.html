The only reason I thought we should be in the park at all was to give <br>
us a chance to have pie. (I'm not sure, but I don't think they would <br>
let us bring any in). If we don't worry about pie we could share <br>
eclaires inside the realm and people could come and go as they please.<br>
<br>
The other idea would be to meet at the park later, say two o'clock or <br>
two-thirty, after the reveling inside the gates. This would be good <br>
in case there be gatherers who don't want to go inside the gates with <br>
all the crazies.<br>

What say ye?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You are assuming there are no crazies in this group! ;oP  I think <br>
you're right tho' about bringing pie in BUT there is fudge and such <br>
and the fudge/chocolate shop! and the baker has lots of cakey kinds <br>
of goodies too! There is also food that could loosely be called good <br>
for you at some of the other food stands. (Portobello mushroom <br>
sandwiches! mmmm!)<br>
<br>
If others don't want to go in and/or the lure of pie is too great, <br>
we can get our hand stamped (another stamp! does that count?) and go <br>
back in later in the afternoon. <br>
<br>
Just throwin' some more ideas out there. Personally, I have never <br>
had a piece of pie to top the eclaires I've had from Friar Tucks <br>
Bakery but that's just me... tee hee, AND remember, you can buy <br>
discount tix at Kings Soopers. <br>
<br>
So say I!  (while sewing like a mad woman to get costumes and such <br>
ready!) ;oP  <br>
