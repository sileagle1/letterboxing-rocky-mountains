<br/>
Didn't want you to feel ignored amongst all this pirate talk and at <br/>
the risk of being PREsumptuous speaking for other placers, here's what <br/>
I know about boxes placed for the GL Gathering (aka GLG) for your <br/>
Monday trip to that lovely town so you have a chance to print clues <br/>
and PREpare for your upcoming adventure:<br/>
<br/>
I was the person who brought 4 clues to the GLG (2 of mine and 2 of <br/>
Front Ranger Hiker's.)  My clues are all up and ready for your GL <br/>
boxing pleasure, if you haven't checked LbNA recently.  I know that as <br/>
of late today, Smoked Salmon (FRH's box) now has clues up on LbNA.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, re: Boxer Lover's Face the Sun box (based on a status <br/>
change on one my boxes far from GL I wonder if she may be travelling <br/>
again? - lucky "dog" - woof, woof!).  It's my understanding that there <br/>
are two listings for this box...one for when the box was placed <br/>
specifically for the GLG with the notation GLG, and a second after it <br/>
was placed in its permanent home after the GLG was over -this would be <br/>
the clues you want to print.<br/>
<br/>
Aljan has some wonderful! boxes up in GL you should definitely check <br/>
out... not placed for the GLG, however some were pulled around the <br/>
event for various reasons, but I think? most/all? have now been <br/>
replaced?<br/>
<br/>
So.......happy clue printing and have a GRAND time!<br/>

there is one in Empire by Aljan and one on the pass planted by Autumn's <br/>

gathering...clues are posted!  Also, Moffat Road is near SKI <br/>
TRAIN...but, watch the weather so the road doesn't get washed out <br/>
before ye peeping eyes!  Have fun, there are GREAT boxes up there!<br/>

Hey gang - hope you don't mind me sending out this note with a request to<br/>
CHEER for Grand Lake and help us save our school! You may have seen this<br/>
going around on FaceBook. I'm not 100% sure of the details, but there is a<br/>
multimillion dollar prize for the winning towns. If Grand Lake wins, part<br/>
of the money has already been promised for keeping Grand Lake elemetary<br/>
OPEN! Outside of a financial miracle like this one, Grand Lake Elementary<br/>
is almost certain to CLOSE next school year! Once closed, it is not likely<br/>
to repoen, EVER! Grand Lake Elementary had some serious spirit and is vital<br/>
to our kids and our town.<br/>
<br/>
So, please, take a few minutes each day to cheer for Grand Lake!<br/>
<br/>
