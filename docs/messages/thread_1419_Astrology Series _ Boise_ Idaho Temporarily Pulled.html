                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have temporarily pulled this entire series.  Many were MIA and the <br/>
ones that were still alive I pulled this evening.  I discovered they <br/>
were not hidden well or were totally exposed.  I found two of them just <br/>
sitting out in the open.  I need to put a bit of though into the re-<br/>
carve and re-plant plan I have for this series.  I loved the location <br/>
but with the high traffic, high river and the boxes being left out in <br/>
the open to fend for themselves I need to reconsider the hiding spots <br/>
and sizes of the boxes before I put them back out again.  12 boxes are <br/>
a lot to maintain when they keep disappearing.  However, I do have <br/>
every intention of re-planting these boxes.  <br/>
