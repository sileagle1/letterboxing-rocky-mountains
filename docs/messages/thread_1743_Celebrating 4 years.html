It has been four years since I discovered this addiction (oops, hobby)and found my first box. I've met some wonderful people and was introduced to places in my own backyard that I never knew existed.<br>

My first box was "The Rock", planted on Alcatraz Island Prizon, just off the coast of San Francisco, CA on 4/9/03.   <br>
<br>
My first Colorado box was two months later, also on the Dakota Ridge trail, where funhog's box "Rain Cloud" still exists (if I'm not mistaken!).  <br>
<br>
Happy Anniversary!<br>

<br>
We just had our 7th anniversary of boxing where we located several boxes in Roxborough Park (Probably have found about 200, however, I need to update the website.  So, I'm not sure that I'll ever come close to your current finds FRH! ; )  Happy to hear you saw our stamp in Kansas.  Wow, that was awhile ago!<br>
<br>
Our First Finders wasn't until June 2004 and it was "The Meaning of Life" by Eoghan.  Beautiful hike on Kenosha Pass!  We miss you Eoghan!  Loved you letterboxes!<br>
<br>
Hugs, Peach<br>

Congrats on your anniversary and especially your HUGE number of finds!<br>
<br>
My first box was Nut in a Rut by Cadenza, Huntsville UT, on 12-11-2004;<br>
she hadn't even listed it yet.  I stumbled across it while looking for a<br>
geocache hidden about 5 feet away.  I made the switch and the rest is<br>
history.<br>

That is so exciting- I can't even fathom that many!!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We sarted in May, and our first find was "Pie in the big sky" by StormCrow.  We've found 67, thanks to our vacation this summer.  But will be on hiatus during the long Montana winters.  LBing isn't very big where we are, but we have plans to do a lot of hides!!!<br>
