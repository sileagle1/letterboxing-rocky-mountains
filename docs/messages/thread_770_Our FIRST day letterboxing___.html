                    <div class="plaintext-content">I told you all I was a rookie but let me tell you about our day! It was TOO cool!! <br>
 <br>
We have been planning and trying to get out since I heard of this in january. A couple attempts failed because we never made it or someone forgot the clues etc... My 15 yo daughter, 8 yo son and 10 yo niece and I got ready to finally do this! <br>
 <br>
Well, today we were ready with stamps, clues, stamp pad, baggies, pens, markers all the goodies! The more I have read about LBing, the more I tell my kids about it, the more excited everyone gets... so we set off. <br>
 <br>
1st stop was Quail lake, pretty easy, kids loved it, we all had fun. <br>
2nd stop was Bear Creek . As we are walking down the trail we see a family with a stroller and three small kids coming up behind us so we sat down at a bench to let them pass. I pulled out my clue sheet and was reading it. they pass by, we get up and start walking. The lady turns back to us and said we couldn't help noticing that you have the same paper we do. I said you are kidding. How cool is that. we can exchange stamps! She said we can? Hesitantly. So I said hey we will hang back and let you do your thing, you can put it back and get on your way and then we will find it. <br>
Well we dawdle and hike and sit on a bench and take our time. the kids played my daughter and I talk. Next thing my niece is yelling... KRIS, THAT LADY..... i said SHHHH Whitney come here. I explain that this is like a secret club and you don't want to yell out whatever you were gonna say. She said well that lady wants you to come with them. So we walk up and they had the box out and wanted us all to stamp together. 5 of them, 4 of us  made for a lot of stamping sitting on the trail. But she said we also have a surprise for you. <br>
 <br>
They had a hitchhiker that they brought from GEORGIA!!! How cool is that? 2 finds, 5 exchanges and a hitchhiker all on our first day! <br>
 <br>
We had a blast and are going back out tomorrow morning!  WHooo HOOO!!! <br>
