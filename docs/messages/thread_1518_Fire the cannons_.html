I know this isn't letterboxing, but I'm a letterboxing pirate and I <br>
have an adventure tomorrow that I want to share with ye!<br>
<br>
For Pirate Mother's Day Skeetch has booked me passage on a tall ship!  <br>
We'll board tomorrow evening in Coos Bay.  I'll find out when I arrive <br>
if I sail on the Lady Washington or the Hawaiian Chieftain.  When we've <br>
all boarded, we set sail for a 'thrilling' three hour mock battle with <br>
each other!  Now, come on, a battle!  With cannons!  ARRRRRR!!  <br>
<br>
Wish you all could zoom up here and play.  Peachy!  I need your dread <br>
self on my ship!  Woo!<br>

The only thing that could have been better would be... if you could <br>
have boarded the Lady Washington after a few devastating hits, <br>
searched the namby-pamby tourists for jewelry as they begged for <br>
mercy, brought your prisoners back to the Chieftan as ye set fire to <br>
the sinking vessel, and then found a good spot for the little crow <br>
