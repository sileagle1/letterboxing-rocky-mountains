Hello folks-<br/>
<br/>
I was able to find a few letterboxes this weekend even though they <br/>
were covered with snow. Doc Holiday is alive and well at his <br/>
gravesite and Grizzly Creek is doing fine too. I also stamped into <br/>
the new journal for Big Fish (very nice!).<br/>
<br/>
It was challenging to find these because, well, it's hard to see the <br/>
trail much less the landmarks. Luckily there was nobody at these <br/>
boxes but me, so I could not only snoop around discreetly, but also <br/>
sweep the snow back over my tracks when I was done. <br/>
<br/>
I had a great time and, as always, really enjoyed the clues, stamps <br/>
and journals in these Spledid Buccaneer boxes. I also think this <br/>
qualifies me as a Maniac Sick-in-the-Head Letterboxer which has been <br/>
my goal all year.<br/>
<br/>
Box On!<br/>

You are my hero.<br/>

Es, who hopes to join the maniac-sick-in-the-head-letteboxer club <br/>
sometime and is not even sure if SHE could find Doc in the snow<br/>
