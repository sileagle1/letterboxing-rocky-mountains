Swedish fish are just one of those things that just happened. While <br/>
letterboxing with my sister-in-law in MA last summer, we were <br/>
starving and had a choice, more boxes or stop for lunch. Of course, <br/>
the boxes won out and we stopped quickly at a little market that was <br/>
dark and dirty but had lots of candy. We had swedish fish (chewy, <br/>
red, strawberry-ish flavored, easily carried up remote canyons and <br/>
probably has a shelf-life of 200 years) and ever since then, we keep <br/>
a baggie of fish among the other tools in our pack! So, it's more of <br/>
a comfort-happy memory food than anything else and is used often to <br/>
bribe 4 year-old hikers that just don't want to hike just one more <br/>
mile! LOL<br/>
<br/>
I didn't get those boxes planted yet, Es, so if you come to town, <br/>
I'll just have to provide some pie with merangue, how about lemon?<br/>

Oh!  Swedish Fish.  Like the kind you catch with gummi worms. <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I like those too. And I like those traditions that get started <br/>
and become part of the ritual. To this day I can't drink Sprite <br/>
without thinking of all the movies I really liked as a kid.<br/>

mmmmmmm.... pie<br/>
<br/>
Did y'all get a lot of snow, Kat?  We'll probably hold off for a few <br/>
weeks since we're more than a little unorganized right now. But no <br/>
matter when you plant those, they'll be on our short list!  I'm very <br/>
grateful to have you so close by so I can zoom over on a day off!<br/>
