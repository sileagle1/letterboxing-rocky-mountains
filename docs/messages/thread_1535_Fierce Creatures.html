<br>
FRH and preboxed came down to SW Colorado for some serious letterbox <br>
hunting. The day I spent with them was all fun and games except for <br>
when FRH almost got struck by a diamondback. (Yikes!!) The picture is <br>
in a new folder called Fierce Creatures and I invite anyone to put <br>
pictures of other wild encounters in that folder. (I know there are a <br>
few wildlife pictures already in those folders.)<br>
<br>
I have to admit that I have been a little cavalier about watching out <br>
for wild animals while letterboxing. I spend a LOT of time poking <br>
around in both the mountains and the desert and have never had anything <br>
bad happen. But in this case it was a REALLY close call. He was <br>
camoflaged so well that you couldn't see him until you were right on <br>
top of him. If it weren't for his warning rattle it could have turned <br>
out a LOT worse on that day.<br>
<br>
Thankfully, that encounter only served to add a little adrenaline to <br>
what became a dawn-to-dusk FUN FEST.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

Hello all-<br>
<br>
FRH and preboxed came down to SW Colorado for some serious letterbox <br>
hunting. The day I spent with them was all fun and games except for <br>
when FRH almost got struck by a diamondback. (Yikes!!) The picture is <br>
in a new folder called Fierce Creatures and I invite anyone to put <br>
pictures of other wild encounters in that folder. (I know there are a <br>
few wildlife pictures already in those folders.)<br>
<br>
I have to admit that I have been a little cavalier about watching out <br>
for wild animals while letterboxing. I spend a LOT of time poking <br>
around in both the mountains and the desert and have never had anything <br>
bad happen. But in this case it was a REALLY close call. He was <br>
camoflaged so well that you couldn't see him until you were right on <br>
top of him. If it weren't for his warning rattle it could have turned <br>
out a LOT worse on that day.<br>
<br>
Thankfully, that encounter only served to add a little adrenaline to <br>
what became a dawn-to-dusk FUN FEST.<br>

pre, I was trying to figure out if this story was the same story as <br>
you posted a week or so ago!  I couldn't remember the details of the <br>
other, besides it involving a big snake.  Unbelievable that it's not <br>
the same story!  You better be carrying a big stick at all times this <br>
summer, even for the urban boxes!  LOL<br>

about an hour from the trailhead with no one around, and I remember <br>

It is a good reminder for all of us to watch where we are walking and where we put our hands.  I tell Nimbus and Cirrus everyday to watch where they are walking, because they often have their heads up in the clouds.  We see quite a few different snake species right out our back door and that includes the Prairie Rattlesnake with which we've have had our fair share of close encounters.<br>
