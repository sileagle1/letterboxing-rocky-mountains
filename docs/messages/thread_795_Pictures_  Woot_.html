all the other pirate tales!  What attire!  This group makes you <br>

Check out the last two photos....can you identify these culprits?  It <br>
appears they were escaping with Esmereldas' Huzzah, Huzzah letterbox!  <br>
Es, send the Buccaneers after them if your box turns up missing!<br>
<br>
Esmerelda WOW'd us with an unbelievable gathering stamp!  Check it out!<br>
<br>
What a GREAT day!  Good times with good people!  Wish you all could <br>
have been there!  And the location of the next one will be???<br>
