                    <div class="plaintext-content">I decided to walk all the trails that lead you to my "Balancing Act" box tonight. All three trails have standing water on them. Some more and some less. I wear waterproof boots so it is not an issue for me. Basically the longer trail to the west has the least amount of water. The trail in the middle has some water and the trail to the east is extremely soft, muddy and wet with some deep water. The water is from the irrigation ditches that have flooded on to the paths. The water will definitely dry up in the summer and during the winter it was never an issue. Please wear the appropriate shoes for your stroll.  I also made a slight edit to the clue map.  Make sure to take along the new map. <br>
