                    <div class="plaintext-content">Three Nevada letterboxes are missing!  The Welcome Center box (we <br/>
actually saw the empty box); the One Armed Bandit (which we <br/>
confirmed with somebody else that we were in the correct spot); and <br/>
the micro box on the strip.  We were so bummed!  The Welcome Center <br/>
box and the Micro box were in too public of places (in our humble <br/>
opinion) and maybe a non-letterboxer decided to keep them.  Who <br/>
knows!  But, it was very frustrating, especially as we spent too <br/>
much time in very HOT temperatures to look for them just to discover <br/>
them missing!  GADS!  We did find the one in St. George and LOVED <br/>
it!  Hope you all can go find it sometime!  We also found a couple <br/>
in southern CA that were fun.  We hope to plant some here now that <br/>
we're back from our trip.<br/>
