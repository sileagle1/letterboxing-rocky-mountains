This sweet girl and her furry companion are looking forward to your visit! You're not in Kansas anymore!<br/>

The Greenbelt is lovely at 6:00 a.m.  It definitely beats 100 degree temperatures at 6:00 p.m.  Raisin and Jay could not agree more.  Take our advice and visit the box in the morning if you can.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. The BOM from Roots and Shoots Redmond has not been updated for July or August yet. I think she must be having a very busy summer with her girls.  As soon as I receive a new stamp I will be sure to post an update.<br/>

Happy Hunting! BVR<br/>
