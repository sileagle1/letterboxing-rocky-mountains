Finally a chance to wipe the sleep from my eyes and pry my feet out <br>
of my hiking boots (yes, I drove 10 hours with them on) to take a <br>
moment to say "Thank You" to all the great letterboxers who made the <br>
Box on the Rocks Gathering a wonderful adventure!  I appreciated all <br>
the time and effort put together for the event and also the <br>
preparation of the new boxes and special carvings contained in each.  <br>
Oh how A-Bear, SW Sun Seeker, Lizman and I marveled and smiled each <br>
time we found a new box on the trail.  We totally loved the <br>
creativity and thought put into each box!  And we really enjoyed <br>
hitting the trail with all the other letterboxers that attended the <br>
event too.  What a wonderful way to share a hobby we are all so <br>
passionate about!<br>
<br>
As a smile back I have not wasted a moment and stayed up way too late <br>
last night posting the simple boxes I left behind so our new Moab <br>
friends would have a tiny reminder of their fanatic Idaho friends to <br>
the north.  You will have to let me know once you hit the trail if I <br>
have messed up any of my clues or the boxes for that matter.  Once I <br>
landed at the computer last night I realized that I had clues <br>
scribbled in a million places and none of them made sense  imagine <br>
that!  Epically the ones little Lizman (Alex) helped with.  HA!  HA!  <br>
I ended up logging on to some existing boxes to assist with <br>
directions to the places the boxes are hidden.  Although other boxers <br>
hiking with me stamped into the logbooks of the boxes I placed most <br>
of them still contain the first finder artifact for the "real" first <br>
finder.<br>
<br>
Check the site for these new letterboxes:<br>
<br>
"Fish Out of Water" (carved and placed by Lizman)  Moab, Utah<br>
"Sharp Tooth"  Price, Utah<br>
"Winged Spirit"  Moab, Utah<br>
"High Noon"  Moab, Utah<br>
"Easy Rider Kokopelli"  Moab, Utah<br>
"Kokopelli's Hole In One"  Moab, Utah<br>
<br>
With the great boxes we found during our visit I have already called <br>
a friend who knows how to make logbooks and I may just try my hand at <br>
a little more homemade feel to the ones I place in the future.  <br>
Thanks for the creative inspiration!<br>
<br>
A special thank you also to A-Bear. When she first mentioned making <br>
the trip I was like "WHAT?"  Fortunately common sense was thrown out <br>
the window in a matter of minutes and Lizman and I were on board for <br>
the journey!  We had a simply wonderful time and thank you again to <br>
our Moab hosts!<br>
