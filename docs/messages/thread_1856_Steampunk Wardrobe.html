To come up with their one-of-a-kind creations, Steampunk artists turn to Victorian-era fashion to create their foundation and then build and embellish from there, adding Steampunk influences from fiction, film, and animation.  The goal is to marry the sensibilities of Emily Bronte to the all out rebellious attitude of a time-traveling Johnny Rotten.  <br>
<br>
Although some people are likely to wear Steampunk-influences clothing every day, costumes are more over-the-top attire, often worn only at Steampunk, anime, or cosplay conventions.  Costumes are designed and constructed specifically to evoke a character or vision from a retro-futuristic world.<br>
<br>
Special Event Notes:  Costumes are encouraged but not necessary to attend.  The extended weather forecast for October 15th is mostly sunny with a high of 64 degrees.  Be sure your clothing elements include layers for warmth (as well as fashion).  You will be wandering on flat trails that are paved and unpaved.  Be sure your shoes are appropriate or bring extra's to change into.  Some of the boxes will be planted off trail and may include you time traveling into the brush.  To help discover the hiding spot of these boxes be sure to bring your compass for accurate navigation.  Although there is only a 20% chance of rain a parasol is never out of fashion even for sky pirates.<br>
