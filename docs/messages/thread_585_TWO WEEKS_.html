Wow! I've got to get busy and finish the 2 PLB rings I need to get<br/>
done before then - and - brush up my newly carved personal stamp (you<br/>
folks really do not know what an accomplishment that is for one so<br/>
artistically impaired)- and - see if I can get a personal traveler<br/>
ready - and - try to do a HH to leave in Moab - and - go retrieve the<br/>
HH going to IN that Puppypaws has graciously offered to facilitate -<br/>
and - try to memorize all the trail names and real names (short term<br/>
memory gets shorter every day)- and -foster an appetite for pie (well,<br/>
that one's already done).<br/>
<br/>
BUT today I am going boxing because the weather is gorgeous and it's<br/>
going to deteriorate tomorrow. Plenty of time for carving when the<br/>
snow/sleet/rain are raging outside.<br/>

questions or such to bring them out that wants to drop any hints<br/>
before the gathering?  I haven't carved one b/c I haven't had<br/>
opportunity to meet with enough boxers at a gathering to make it worth<br/>
the effort yet.  I just exchange my sig stamp and call it good.<br/>

Whooop! It's coming up fast! We are going to book our space today, so <br/>
unless there is some giant natural disaster, I think my group will <br/>
make it.<br/>
<br/>
A thought - what if the weather decides to work against us?? Is there <br/>
an alternate space we can go to inside? Or are we just gonna risk it <br/>
all?! Wooo hooo!  Too cool that this has become so huge! We are really <br/>
looking forward to seeing everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm... pie.... =3<br/>

Hey Puppypaws - try freezing the pink stuff overnight before you do <br/>
any fine detail. That will sometimes help with the 'too soft' problem!<br/>
