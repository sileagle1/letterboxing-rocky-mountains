                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm putting together more letterboxes to plant (I planted my first one <br>
on Saturday) and need ideas for first finder rewards.  I've only been <br>
first on two boxes and was impressed with the creativity of the first <br>
finder items. <br>
<br>
I'd like your thoughts before I plant any more boxes.  What is the <br>
best first finder item that you have planted or found?  Are <br>
certificates better, or would you prefer other (dare I say...) "stuff" <br>
that relates to the theme of the box?  I got a cute Dilbert doll from <br>
the Dilbox LB that I would never call junk ;-)<br>

Perhaps there will be some FFs for you to find very soon!<br>

Es, who loves her Kat FFs which not only fit in her journal but <br>
usually fit perfectly into the little boxes they're found in as well <br>
in all shapes and sizes!<br>
