Hiya Jodie-<br>
    The campgrounds that Kat and I were talking about a few posts <br>
back are BLM campgrounds, and they don't take reservations. My <br>
experience is that you can usually find a spot if you go looking in <br>
the afternoon. Towards evening they start filling right up. These <br>
campsites usually cost 10 bucks a night if I remember right.<br>
<br>
 There is another possibility-- the KOA style campgrounds where you <br>
pay 20-25 bucks for a tent site and you get to have a few amenities, <br>
like a shower. They usually have game rooms so your kids can learn to <br>
hustle pool while you are enraptured on your chaise lounge. The <br>
brochure I got from the Visitor Center in Moab lists 16 such <br>
campgrounds around Moab. So, more money, but you KNOW where you are <br>
going to stay. They of course have RV sites too, and many of them <br>
have one and two room cabins. Most of these allow pets, but they <br>
charge a little extra.<br>
<br>
I don't really know about the hotels. <br>

I won't be camping this trip and have looked into hotels in the area.<br>
Many of them allow our 4-legged boxers, or, I suspect, any breed.  <br>

This is a pretty dog friendly town, most motels allow dogs, and <br>
there are places along Main Street where you always find dogs tied <br>
while people are in stores shopping around! And millions of happy <br>
dog hikes!!!!<br>
