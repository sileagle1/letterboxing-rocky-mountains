Springtime is upon us. I know what you're thinking. Man I should get out there and plant some stuff for my fellow letterboxers to enjoy.<br>
<br>
Before you do - come see us on April 9th! Lots of newbies in the area, I'm hoping to put some names to faces. And you veteran letterboxers - yeah you, reading this right now - you know who you are! Don't be shy! People want to get to know you!<br>
<br>
I'll be doing a carving workshop. Bring your tools, something you are working on, and your questions. we'll do some transfers and talk about materials too.<br>
<br>
TaiChi is also going to show us how to make letterbox pouches, and give us some tips on encryption.<br>
