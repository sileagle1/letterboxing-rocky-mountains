Tucson boxing is a lot of fun.  We were down there last Christmas and<br>

at the U of A for nearly a decade and still have some good friends in<br>
that territory.  I moved back here to marry another really nice guy ...<br>

To anyone who gets a chance to box in Tucson ...  Everything that Kristal<br>
and Ron and AzRoadie put out is worth looking for ... ditto for Funhog<br>
who has a few of them there.  Ramdelt, did you get Funhog's Happy<br>
Javelina yet?  It's a great stamp, but the crosscountry hiking through<br>
cholla was pretty treacherous with kids.<br>
<br>
Have a great Thanksgiving everyone!<br>

We were there last year and gave up because we were so confused and had the gradparents watching the kids in the parking lot.  We have however hit a few since we arrived on Saturday and have seen your stamp in a few of them.  Have a great Thanksgiving!<br>
