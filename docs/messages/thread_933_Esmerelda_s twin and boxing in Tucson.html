Tucson boxing is a lot of fun.  We were down there last Christmas and<br/>

To anyone who gets a chance to box in Tucson ...  Everything that Kristal<br/>
and Ron and AzRoadie put out is worth looking for ... ditto for Funhog<br/>
who has a few of them there.  Ramdelt, did you get Funhog's Happy<br/>
Javelina yet?  It's a great stamp, but the crosscountry hiking through<br/>
cholla was pretty treacherous with kids.<br/>

Have a great Thanksgiving everyone!<br/>

&gt; &gt; None of you are going to believe this but I have a great story for <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; you.  The last few years I have been coming here to Tucson to see my <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; folks for Thanksgiving.  Last year we were on the exact same plane <br/>
&gt; with another group of people and I remember them because of the <br/>
&gt; really nice man who helped carry one of my child's car seats.  So <br/>
&gt; Saturday I'm sitting at DIA waiting for our flight again and who <br/>
&gt; comes walking down to the same flight?  This same guy.  Not only <br/>
&gt; that, but I sat looking at his wife thinking..."I know her from <br/>
&gt; somewhere".  Now, to be honest, the last few times that I have been <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; flying I have thought about Esmerelda and wondered if I would see <br/>
&gt; her.  The crazy thing was, I thought this was her because I had seen <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the pictures of here at the festival get together.  When this nice <br/>
&gt; guy came over to ask us if we needed help again (I think his name is <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Jim), I asked him where his family was from.  He said Centenial and <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; then said Parker.  I had forgotten for the moment that Es had said <br/>
&gt; that she had family in Parker but then I said that his wife looked <br/>
&gt; so <br/>
&gt; much like someone I know but she lives out near Grand Junction.  He <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; then told me that his wife Kim grew up in Palisade.  Believe it of <br/>
&gt; not folks but this great guy is Es's brother in law!  And I must say <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; that Kim looks exactly like Es!  I believe that I even met Es's <br/>
&gt; parents!  Can you believe that I actually recognized her family with <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; only seeing her pictures from the gatherings?  WOW!<br/>
