Yes, I would like a copy. I wrote the clues down, but sort of in a<br/>
short hand and I could have easily missed something vital. Thanks for<br/>
the prompt about logging on Atlas Quest; that's done now. This is fun!<br/>
I hope I get the other HHs in the series and can figure out the<br/>
answers. <br/>
I enjoyed meeting and boxing with you in Moab. I forgot to ask how the<br/>
TV interview went. So how did it go?<br/>
Glad you boys made it home safe. Hope Stubby's finger mends in a good<br/>
way.<br/>
