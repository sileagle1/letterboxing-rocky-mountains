I've been in Sunny California for the last six days, and am heading <br/>
home tonight.  I'm thrilled to see a few more boxes planted in our <br/>
area!  Thanks BabyBear!  I can't wait to find them.<br/>
<br/>
I went boxing in CA last thursday with Eric (California Bear) and was <br/>
thrilled to locate NINE boxes in one afternoon.  Yes ... NINE.  Wow.  <br/>
And all of these in local city parks - no mountainous hiking involved.<br/>
<br/>
Eric was just the nicest person I've ever met, and I owe him a huge <br/>
thank you note.  I'm completely inspired to plant boxes in more urban <br/>
areas now, and I could not believe how simple these were - and the <br/>
stamps!~  ... *faints*  they're just beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping to see you all on the trails soon (before it gets too snowy)<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
