factor" for anyone who could not attend, but it was a really great <br>
time.  Es's house was decked out in banners and her yard was covered <br>
in Lord of the Rings letterboxes.  She'd made each of us a special <br>
logbook, a book of clues, a map of Mt. Doom and a nametag with the <br>
event stamp design on it.  We had a great time having dinner (and of <br>
course pie!) and stamping ourselves silly.  It was a great evening of <br>
seeing old friends and meeting new ones.<br>
<br>
Mt. Doom was amazing today - there were SO many amazing boxes and, of <br>
course, more decorations and fun on the mountain.  I had a great day <br>
of inky fun with the Boxtops.  I hit F250 somewhere along the way, but <br>
to be honest I'm not sure exactly where.  I kinda lost count.<br>
<br>
Thanks so much, Es, for sharing your talents and your hospitality.  It <br>
was a spectacular event!!<br>

Even if you weren't a Lord of the Rings fan it was a letterboxer's <br>

Thank you so much for all your kind comments.  It was such a pleasure <br>
having you all here to play with me!  I hardly raised a finger all <br>
weekend!<br>
<br>
I've got all of the boxes posted.  If you have a clue posted to one <br>
of the older boxes, it would be great if you'd delete the old clues.  <br>
You'll all be getting updates from the new postings which pretty much <br>
all contain different clues than before.  I'll be posting a single <br>
listing on LBNA to guide folks to the many boxes on AQ.  If you'd <br>
like to list your's individually on LBNA, wonderful!  It would be <br>
great if you'd mention the others in your post so no one gets <br>
confused!<br>
<br>
I've posted some pictures on Atlas Quest.. please feel free to post <br>
more!  And shout out if I've spelled your name wrong or a picture <br>
makes you cringe.  <br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/gallery/viewalbum.html?gAlbumId=913<br>
<br>
What a weekend.. it's one I'll never forget.  All of you great people <br>
made it a wonderful memory for me.<br>
<br>
Thank you, thank you!<br>

conceived and executed. When I learned her plans for the event, it <br>
boggled my mind! Thanks goodness First Mate Jen was there to add her <br>
created expertise. It eased the disappointment that I would not be able <br>
to attend to be a small part of the preparation and I thank Es for the <br>
opportunity.8~D<br>
<br>
The photos are wonderful; thanks so much for posting. I recognize many <br>
old friends and will be able to identify you who are new to me whenever <br>
we meet down the road.<br>
<br>
My weekend (and the reason I could not attend) went equally as well as <br>
yours. My son was successfully married to his sweetheart in a beautiful <br>
ceremony here in UT. All went off without a hitch even better than <br>
hoped for. Thank you for your well wishes for my family.<br>

Until we meet again,<br>
