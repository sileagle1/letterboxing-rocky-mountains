Get out your carving tools, your tupperware (or lock 'n locks) and dust off<br/>
your hiking boots!  Sharpen your clue-writing wits, and join those of us who<br/>
(so far) have committed to planting at least one box during the month of<br/>
April.<br/>
<br/>
And we may be holding a little gathering (at least for those of us in the<br/>
Colorado/Denver area) just to celebrate - so for you Rocky Mountaineers from<br/>
points further out - I encourage you to celebrate the month with your local<br/>
pie fanatics, too!  :)<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
