you going in July or August?  I won't know for about a week if our <br/>
move is a "go" and will let you know.   Who is going to Letterbox with <br/>
me?     <br/>

Thanks, Kat, for the advice on the heat - I did not know that and will <br/>
remember it.  Always wondered how people did it.  The big secret to <br/>
living in Colorado is layering and once you understand that - you're <br/>
OK.  So - I guess now I will be unlayering!!!   <br/>

I've never spent much time in Phoenix, but I did live in Tucson for a<br/>
decade.  It's an easy 1 1/2 hours drive south and there is a nice<br/>
letterboxing community down there.  We recently spent about a month in<br/>
Tucson and vicinity, and found some really nice boxes!  We even met<br/>
Kristal (of Ron and Kristal) for dinner and some stamp exchanges.  The<br/>
Tucson folks had their first annual letterboxing gathering this past<br/>
February or so.  They'd be a good group to be in touch with.<br/>
