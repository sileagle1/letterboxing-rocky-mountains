                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a wonderful time earlier this week in the fair city of Denver.<br/>
Did you know I used to live there? Aurora actually, from 1979-1984. I<br/>
am surprised by the growth and increased traffic every time I go back!<br/>
And even having lived there for 5 years, every place I went<br/>
'box-hunting was somewhere I had never been - so THANKS for that!<br/>
First I met with Silent Wings' sister and nephew for a stamp exchange.<br/>
Very cool stamps!<br/>
<br/>
Then I found: <br/>
Lunch Stop by Fork Finders - first finder for Fork Finder's first<br/>
hide! I got in and out before the prescribed burn. Talked to some nice<br/>
firemen.<br/>
The Gold Miner by TheCarvingClan who lived on THIS side of the Rockies.<br/>
Triceratops by Front Range Hiker - educational trail and I LOVED the<br/>
worm's eye view of the fossils. Good source for your stamp design.<br/>
Coors Beer Microbox by Silver Eagle - busy, busy spot. Like so many<br/>
locals, I enjoyed lunch here watching the geese.<br/>
Onion II by y-nought - I LOVED this 'box from clues to stamp to journal!<br/>
Stegosaurus by JelyBean - I have finally bagged a JelyBean 'box. Great<br/>
clues: short and sweet; and nice carving, too.<br/>
Buffalo Bill Cody by Esmerelda - I believe I found the right spot, but<br/>
Bill was under about 2 feet of snow. I probably could have dug him<br/>
out, but re-hiding would have been a problem and I'm sure I would have<br/>
torn the snow up and possibly attracted the uninitiated. So I'll have<br/>
to catch this one on a return trip.<br/>
Catnip by Front Range Hiker - I loved the journal and Genesee Park is<br/>
beautiful. <br/>
Fodor Glava by Aljan - extraordinary story and an extraordinary<br/>
letterbox. Does Aljan ever disappoint? I think not.<br/>
Eagle Eyes by preboxed - I enjoyed this pair and even though I didn't<br/>
see an eagle, the other critters in the air and on the ground were<br/>
very entertaining.<br/>
<br/>
You all will be happy to know that the Jeffco Open Space folks have<br/>
checked on almost all the Jeffco boxes I found within the past couple<br/>
of months.<br/>
<br/>
I have hidden a new box within Denver city limits and will have the<br/>
clues up soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for the great letterboxes. I barely made a dent and<br/>
look forward to my next trip to Denver to bag some more!<br/>
