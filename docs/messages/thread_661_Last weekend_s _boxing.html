Hi all,<br>
<br>
While not a frequent poster, I do read all that comes across the<br>
board.  Inspired by all your spring 'boxing I've got out there a bit<br>
myself recently.  While in Manitou Springs for a little personal<br>
retreat, I included a foray to the Garden of the Goddesses.  It<br>
certainly was a popular box that weekend.  While there I picked up the<br>
Totem Pole hitchhiker.  With luck, he'll be going to a new resting<br>
place this weekend.  The Goddesses box was in fine shape I'm happy to<br>
announce.  If you haven't snagged it yet, please do ... it's a<br>
beautiful area.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
PhoenixAscending<br>

Ooooo.....me wantee. A stroll in the Garden sounds real good. It's been <br>
raining all day at my house, so it's nothing but carving for me at the <br>
moment.<br>
