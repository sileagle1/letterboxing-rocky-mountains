It is far from secret that I am one of the "nutty" ones, and I am no <br/>
stranger to the trebuchet. Our contest in Farmington, NM has us <br/>
shooting weighted tennis balls instead of pumpkins, but I would say the <br/>
costumes are the most important ingredient. Our team is "Nimrods of the <br/>
North" and we did well last year:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.farmingtonmuseum.org/Trebuchetresults.htm<br/>
<br/>
We are actually going to skip this year's contest because we're headed <br/>
to the Spooktacular in Santa Fe. But we will be paying close attention <br/>
to the distances they are shooting in case we need to fine tune our <br/>
trebby some more.<br/>
<br/>
As far as what I found on Google........it was a nicely done movie <br/>
showing everything from design, to build,  to the Moab superheroes and <br/>
their awesome chucking machine...........Fabulous!<br/>

&gt; Excuuuuse me, who is actually the nutty one? Who has "trebuchet" as a <br/>
favorite word to <br/>
&gt; google!!!!!  I'll have you know that building trebuchets to fling <br/>
pumpkins is very very <br/>
&gt; serious business in these parts! What I want to know is what you <br/>
found under trebuchet <br/>
&gt; that lead you to our nuttiness. <br/>

&gt; I wish we were going back down to the Spooktacular with you guys, but <br/>
maybe next year!<br/>

Well, I am so honored that you are skipping Farmington this year (after <br/>
coming in First Place last year) and coming to our Santa Fe event. Just <br/>
wanted to note that we, too, are into chucking things. The Great Wuga <br/>
Wuga and I got into spud guns this summer and have been using them to <br/>
chuck the readily available locally growing gourds. Can't wait to hear <br/>
more on the trebuchet front. Did you see the most recent issue of Make <br/>
magazine? There's a great article in there about pneumatic air cannons <br/>
for tossing pumpkins.<br/>
Off to go hide some boxes for next week ;-)<br/>

recommend a book, if you don't have it already.  It's called "Backyard <br/>
