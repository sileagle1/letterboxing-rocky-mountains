<br/>
Just dont.<br/>
<br/>
The first box was not horrible.  Took my umbrella, and managed to <br/>
only get somewhat dirty while rummaging underneath the overgrown <br/>
junipers.  I spent the drive to the next box pulling juniper twigs <br/>
out of my hair, and bemoaning my wet boots.<br/>
<br/>
I should have stopped there, but hell .... I'd driven about 75 miles <br/>
so one box was just not gonna cut it.  My next stop was at a wetlands <br/>
preserve, wildlife area.  Beautiful, simply stunning scenery.  I must <br/>
remember to go back when it's nicer out.  The lightning started about <br/>
then, and I worried as I walked with my umbrella - backpack in tow. <br/>
<br/>
My boots were thoroughly soaked by this point, right through to my <br/>
socks which were making squicky squicky noises.  But I pressed <br/>
forward, determined not to let the day end with only one box.  I got <br/>
to the destination, and could see the hiding place of the box - down <br/>
a slight embankment toward the pond.  Cant do that with my umbrella.  <br/>
So, I set my bag down, put the umbrella over it, and proceeded to <br/>
pick my way carefully down the embankment - it wasn't long.  <br/>
<br/>
But as expected on a day like this, the ground gave out beneath me <br/>
and I fell onto my ass, sliding down the embankment and giving a <br/>
liberal coating of mud to my backside in the process.  I got the <br/>
box.  Washed my hands in the pond, stamped in, replaced the box (not <br/>
falling this time).  <br/>
<br/>
By the time I got back to my car, I dont think there was an inch of <br/>
dry skin on my body.  My backpack was covered in mud, as was my <br/>
umbrella, and most of my clothing.  My logbook is wet, my hair has <br/>
some funny twig/seed/leafy things in it, my boots have stopped making <br/>
the squicky noise and have just started to oooze mud.  <br/>
<br/>
And I have a 75 mile drive home.  <br/>
<br/>
Ahhhhh letterboxing.  Gotta love it.<br/>

I think there had been so much rain, that everything was just ... <br/>
WET.  Clean water, though, or I'd not have done it.  *makes a squicky <br/>
face*  I'll email you before I drive up next time so we can hook up <br/>
for an exchange.  *grins*<br/>
<br/>

Yeah - I bet it was the same box.  My little report didn't say which <br/>
box because I didn't want my story to be a spoiler.  Nevertheless, I <br/>
woke this morning with an achy shoulder, a soon-to-be bruise on my <br/>
derrierre, and I'm dreading looking at my hiking boots which are <br/>
likely still wet.  Not to mention the inside of my CAR!!!!  *weeps*<br/>

Dang. Now I feel bad for laughing. Your prose was just so <br/>
descriptive, and I could totally relate, although I didn't end up <br/>
getting quite so wet and muddy.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I was thinking of a pond in a different direction from you. <br/>
I'll be sure to watch out for slippery slopes up in the Fort Collins <br/>
area. As far as passing up a letterbox because of the weather.....I <br/>
haven't been able to do that yet. Does this mean I need an <br/>
intervention? <br/>

Do you?<br/>

Drivers in other cars along I-25 were actually staring at me as I <br/>

I was wet clear through. I thought I was filthy after the first box, <br/>

It was really nice in Grand Junction when my kids found Big Fish, but <br/>
it started to sprinkle over at Johnny Carino's. The storm lifted by <br/>
the time we got to Palisade so we started down the trail for There <br/>
Were These Two Guys.... After the first two boxes set up the joke it <br/>
started to rain again, but like any obsessed father I talked my kids <br/>
into pressing on. I had the box with the punchline in my hand when <br/>
Dark Side of the Moon shouted through the deluge that we couldn't <br/>
open up the box in the downpour without ruining the contents. "Maybe <br/>
we could find a tree to sit under", I spit, hopefully. DSOTM just <br/>
waved his arm towards the stream of water running down the trunk of <br/>
the biggest tree there. Elros stopped shivering and started running <br/>
back as I rehid the box. Then we spent a fun night listening to the <br/>
rain on the tent and trying to guess the punchline to the joke. We <br/>
couldn't.<br/>
<br/>
We laughed hard when we got the punchline yesterday morning and then <br/>
headed up onto Grand Mesa. It hadn't rained up there at all so we had <br/>
fun looking for letterboxes in the four inches of FRESH snow with <br/>
another storm hitting about every twenty minutes. We found two out of <br/>
the four up there and then headed back home, soaked, but quite <br/>
content to have found some truly amazing letterboxes.<br/>

the <br/>
&gt; rain on the tent and trying to guess the punchline to the joke. We <br/>
&gt; couldn't.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We laughed hard when we got the punchline yesterday morning and <br/>
then <br/>
&gt; headed up onto Grand Mesa. It hadn't rained up there at all so we <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; fun looking for letterboxes in the four inches of FRESH snow with <br/>
&gt; another storm hitting about every twenty minutes. We found two out <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; the four up there and then headed back home, soaked, but quite <br/>
&gt; content to have found some truly amazing letterboxes.<br/>
