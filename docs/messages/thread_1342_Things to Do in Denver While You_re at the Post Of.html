<br>
There's a new postal ring posted at AQ called "Things to Do in <br>
Denver!"  Goddess, who created the ring, asked me to post a message <br>
here and give folks a heads up about the ring, which is starting <br>
pretty darn soon on June 15.  Here's a link to the tracker:<br>

<br>
Being the nerd that I am, I picked the Tattered Cover Bookstore, one <br>
of my favorite things to do in Denver, but nearly anything you could <br>
want is still available... unless, of course, you wanted the TC. ;)<br>
