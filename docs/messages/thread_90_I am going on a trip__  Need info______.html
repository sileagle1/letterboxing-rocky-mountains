I am in the planning stages of a car trip from here to Montana to see <br>
my family that I haven't seen in 3 years.  My iquiry is for any <br>
information on letterboxes in Wyoming, Montana, Idaho & Utah.  Please <br>
e-mail me any info any of you have on boxes in these states.  I am <br>
looking for easy, semi-kid-friendly (if I can do it, my daughter can <br>
do it!!) and not missing (preferably  (: ) boxes.  I have pulled all <br>
of the boxes in those states and marked their general position on a <br>
map, but would like to see what all of you think.  I don't have any <br>
idea of what ways I am going but am a firm believer in driving a <br>
different way back than I took to get there, hence the ID & UT ones.  <br>
I would prefer to get the e-mails at my e-mail address than on the <br>
list, but whatever works for you, works for me!!  I will let the main <br>
list know as well and will let you all know what my itinerary is so <br>
that I can maybe get to meet some of you guys in those areas!!<br>
<br>
Thank you so much in advance!!<br>
