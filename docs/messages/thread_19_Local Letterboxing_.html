<br>
Thanks to Autumn for setting up the list. <br>
I went camping last weekend and when I got back there were more than <br>
300 new posts to the main talk list. Overwhelming. It was hard enough <br>
to keep up when there started to be more than 10 or 15 posts a day, <br>
but now it's impossible. So again, thanks. I look forward to hearing <br>
the local perspective from everyone, and having a chance to ask <br>
questions or make comments without getting lost in the raging river <br>
of the big list.<br>
<br>
A few comments about the previous posts on the list:<br>
<br>
1. I also couldn't find the Litha box on my first try and was 'sure' <br>
it had gone MIA. Now that the clues have been revised I'll give it <br>
another shot. Thanks for the updates.<br>
<br>
2. Several people asked about carving stuff; I've been able to find <br>
Speedball Speedycut and lithocutters at Guiry's on S Colorado Blvd. <br>
Several different sizes of the pink stuff as well as the crummy <br>
crumbling garbage and the true linoleum mounted on blocks. They've 4 <br>
other locations around Denver and one in Boulder. Other art supply <br>
stores might be more likely than hobby or craft stores to carry these <br>
things also, though I haven't checked Meininger yet. My favorite <br>
carving media was the large size StadtlerMars vinyl erasers, but <br>
they've discontinued them and their small ones have a raised logo on <br>
them rather than a printed one, making them useless for carving. <br>
Crumbs! If anyone finds a stash of the large ones anywhere, please <br>
let me know. I'll buy as many as I can find.<br>
<br>
3. A thought about the small number of boxes in our area - being a <br>
lonely letterboxer may be frustrating, but the situation can change <br>
very quickly. Before you know it, we might be buried in boxes. The <br>
traffic on the main list attests to that. Two years ago there were <br>
only a handful of boxes in the Portland, OR area. Now they're awash <br>
with them. Perhaps that's a good thing, but from seeing the same <br>
thing happen with geocaching, my personal thought is that "not <br>
enough" can too quickly become "way too much". I prefer a pace where <br>
you can read every clue posted and decide whether to search for the <br>
box or not, and have a chance to go look for it before another <br>
hundred clues build up in your mailbox. But I also prefer small towns <br>
to large ones, and short work weeks to 60+ hour frantic ones, so my <br>
Thoreau-esque bias is obvious. Hopefully letterboxing around here <br>
will hold at some middle point for awhile, where we all have enough <br>
boxes to keep us busy but not enough to start tripping over them at <br>
every turn on the trail.<br>
<br>
4. And a final question - What other similar hobbies are people here <br>
interested in? Are there stamp artists, backpackers, mailart <br>
afficionados, geocachers, scrapbookers, orienteers, or 'altered book' <br>
artists here?<br>

You're so welcome!  I moderate the "big list" and started to get <br>
totally overwhelmed.  I can't imagine trying to check the list after <br>
more than a few days had gone by.  You'd spend hours.  E-gads!<br>

<br>
Well - I'm glad Dixie's group is persistant.  That's the last time <br>
I'll let Eric count off the "paces" to the box.  He's taller than I <br>
am, and now I'm quite certain he counted two steps as one pace.  <br>
Grrr.  Men.  (just teasing)  I think the paces are correctly listed <br>
now, though I'm going to have to head back to Dinosaur Ridge to check <br>
for myself soon.  Meanwhile, the key is to look for the big boulders -<br>
 then up the rock wall from there.<br>
<br>

<br>
As Fiona mentioned, she and I are both into altered books - and <br>
mailart, too!  That's how we found letterboxing to begin with.  A <br>
friend who trades mail art with us mentioned it, and from there, we <br>
were hooked.  I'm not much of a stamp artist (Dixie's found my boxes, <br>
she can attest!) but I'm getting better - besides, the hike is really <br>
the point (I'm saying that to make myself feel better, eh). I've <br>
found one geocache, based solely on the clues - I don't own a GPS.  I <br>
think I'd enjoy it, but I love the treasure hunting aspect of boxing <br>
much better than the actual "treasures" of a geocache.<br>
<br>
As for the altered books - it was that hobby that inspired the art <br>
journal that is accompanying the postal letterbox.  I figured if Mark <br>
can carve a beautiful stamp, the least I could do was create a <br>
beautiful journal to go with it!  :)  <br>
<br>
Thanks for posing the questions - and for joining!  Here's a question <br>
for you, too!  I noticed that most (all??) of the boxes you've <br>
planted were in TX.  Are you out in CO now, or do you just frequent <br>
the Rockies?  <br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Autumn<br>

Glad to hear that there's so much cross-fertilization. Would that <br>
monthly meeting Fiona mentioned happen to be the meetup.com event?<br>
Meetup.com might be a good way to set up letterboxing events as well.<br>
I'll email you my mailing address off list so I can get in on the <br>

Moved to the Denver area a little more than a year ago. I lived in <br>
Austin for 17 years before that so I have very strong ties there, and <br>
weaker ones here (though they're growing). I've several stamps carved <br>
waiting to be hidden but none placed locally so far. Maybe the breath <br>
of fresh air from others' activity will revive me enough to go hide <br>
them.<br>
