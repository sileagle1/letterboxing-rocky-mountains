                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have decided to come down for both weekends because some people were only available for one of the Sundays. I set up a casual meet for this Sunday, hopefully we can plan something even nicer for next Saturday or Sunday. I'm hoping we can all meet at REI around 1pm and  I can introduce Celestini. Everyone can exchange and then maybe we can all plan to get some lunch. I hope to see as many of you there as possible! http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=1739<br/>
