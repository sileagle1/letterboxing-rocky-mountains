different spot.  The stamp turned out to be one of my personal <br/>

he didn't.  So... I give you, 'The Itty Bitty Brain Box'. <br/>

It's very silly.<br/>
Don't hurt yourself trying to get there.<br/>
Take LOTS of ink.<br/>

Uh.. you could get the number wrong and still find it.  Just sayin'.  <br/>
And those certainly are animals, mister.  Didn't you watch them as a <br/>
child?!  <br/>
