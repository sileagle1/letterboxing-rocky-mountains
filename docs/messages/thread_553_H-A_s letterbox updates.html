First, had to slightly relocate "Bite My Shiny..." as the box had a <br>
tendency to wander (we had trouble finding it and we knew where it <br>
was supposed to be).  It is still nearby, but hopefully everybody is <br>
happier with this spot.  Hope no one printed out the clue and headed <br>
out there only to have it moved in the meantime.  If so, our <br>
apologies; hope you had a good walk, at least.  Tie-Dye Gal and <br>
Soccer Chick were the last ones to find it before we moved it.<br>

Second, the new Lemony Letterbox is almost ready and we are hoping <br>
to replant it next weekend (weather permitting).  It will be in the <br>
same vicinity, but hopefully we'll do a better job of finding a safe <br>
location.  If you stamped in before, you may want to stamp into the <br>
new journal, but the stamp you will be putting in your own will be <br>
the same as it was.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, we just found that several hours ago....we probably only missed you by an hour or less.  We had no trouble finding it. Soccer chick saw the log and went right to it.  (But we didnt know where it was supposed to be.)  I have finally started looking at clues on lbna right before I go because Ive used old clues before and only after coming home empty handed I find that it is missing.<br>
<br>
We also found Dilbox today.  Both were cute stamps and nice walks.  My daughter, Soccer Chick, knew who Bender was but Id never heard of it.<br>
And Puppy Paws, yes you beat me to Dilbox by a long shot.  But I did<br>
know where it was in September...just never went there!!  <br>
<br>
Yesterday I found the Masters Vision (another one I should have done awhile ago-as its 5 min from my house!).<br>
<br>
Been doing close lb's the last 3 weekends and have seen some stamps for the first time....jelybean/Jodie's/Ynought.  Nice to place stamps with emails.  Someday maybe we will be able to place faces also....<br>
<br>
Hope to see you all on the trail.....we were close today!<br>
