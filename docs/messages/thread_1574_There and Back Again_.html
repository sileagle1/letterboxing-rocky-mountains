Indeed, thanks to all who made contributions to Mount Doom.  The place is loaded with loot!<br>

What a magical weekend!  We missed you Boxer Lover and thank you for your assistance.  Many, many thanks to that Pirate Queen, Esmerelda, who wowed us with her many talents.  Thanks also to her trusty fellow Splendid Buccaneers ... Skeetch, the cook, great sport, fishing guide and Cloud gatherer, etc. AND Jen, the very talented chief set assistant!  Everything was perfect down to every last detail.  And, those handmade journals and maps are real treasures!  Palisade's pirates are the best!<br>
<br>
It was so good to see all of you!  I'll post some photos when my tech support, Cirrus, rises from his slumber.<br>
