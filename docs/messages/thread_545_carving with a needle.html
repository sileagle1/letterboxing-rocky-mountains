<br/>
Carving with a needle is an interesting thing.  In some ways it was<br/>
great and in some ways it was a pain.<br/>
<br/>
I just went to one of the many local farm supply stores out here and<br/>
asked for the needles.  There were a bunch of different sizes so I<br/>
bought about four sizes.  I've found it isn't worth the effort to use<br/>
the bigger ones.  I can get the same results from my normal tools with<br/>
a more comfortable hand.<br/>
<br/>
The needles are for veterinary use.  You should have seen the look on<br/>
the sales person's face when I explained that I wanted them for<br/>
carving rubber stamps.  She told me that she thought she had heard<br/>
every possible strange and bizarre use for the needles (not all legal<br/>
either), but that this was definitely the most unusual.  One nice<br/>
thing was the needles only cost 15-25 cents each!<br/>
<br/>
You don't use the tube of the needle, like you might think.  In fact,<br/>
you won't come near the tube.  The sharp part at the bottom can be<br/>
used like a very small X-acto.  It works nicely for very fine detail. <br/>
The needles are small though and weren't made to be held that way.  I<br/>
tried buying a syringe that fit them, but it was too cumbersome to<br/>
use.  I found that if I carved for a long time with the needles, my<br/>
hands cramped up more than usual, so I only used them for very fine<br/>
detail.  I did like the results though.  I really don't use them tons<br/>
since I have got pretty good at using the speedball for even fine<br/>
detail, but sometimes you just need a knife and the exacto feels huge<br/>
on very tiny detail.  Give it a try!  I've known some that loved the<br/>
results and others that hated carving with them.  I think it is a<br/>
personal choice.  I tend to get pretty picky with some of the quality<br/>
of my own carving, so I liked them.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps--let me know if you have other questions,<br/>
