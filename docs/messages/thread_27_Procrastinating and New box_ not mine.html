                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well guys, I know I just posted saying I was gonna go 'boxing.  I <br>
thought about it and my car is just not going to go anywhere without <br>
me worring about it.  I have planned to go and get it checked out on <br>
Wednesday so hopefully I will be able to go after that.<br>
<br>
BTW, did anybody see that there is a new box in our beautiful <br>
state??  It is located in Bailey and I know exactly where it is <br>
(pretty much).  It is off of a Forest Road that I have driven down <br>
numerous times as it was the worst of the fires that were up that way <br>
a couple of summers ago.  If anybody is interested in taking a trip <br>
up there, I would love to go!!  I will probably get up there as soon <br>
as I know what is up with my truck.  I do have a 4x4 with more than <br>
enough room in it.  So I will keep everbody posted and let me know if <br>
any of you want to trek up them there hills!!<br>
<br>
Holla at ya all soon!!<br>

It was a happy coincidence to see that one posted, and I've invited <br>
the placers to our list, but I think they might have been just <br>
visitors to our great state.<br>
<br>
The only problem with taking you and Trinity Jah with me, is that I'm <br>
staying for almost a week, so getting you back down to civilization <br>
will be more of a challenge.  Hmmm...<br>
<br>
Will your car make it as far as Bailey?  Perhaps we can caravan to <br>
that point?  Fiona?  Joe?  Anyone else interested in going up?  I'm <br>
going on Tuesday - and thought I'd do the box before I got all the <br>
way to Wellington Lake.<br>
