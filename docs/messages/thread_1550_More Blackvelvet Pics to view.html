Blackvelvet, it was so great to see you and that wonderful son of yours!  It appears that we <br/>
need to get out boxing to add your latest additions that you left us here in Colorado!  You <br/>
rock the Rockies!<br/>
<br/>
Hugs, Peach!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I posted a few shots from our mini meet too - although I do have more to add but have not had the time. I need to update my LB blog too. We did have a great visit with everyone and managed to plant 9 boxes while we were in Colorado and we found 13 - we almost broke even between plants and finds.My suitcase may have been lighter on the way home but with all that Celestial Seasonings tea from their tent sale it was actually heavier! Hopefully our new boxes will stay safe and sound for quite some time.<br/>

Happy hunting! Blackvelvetrav<br/>
