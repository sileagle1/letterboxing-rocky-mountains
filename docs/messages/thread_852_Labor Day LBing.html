     Yep, I was already planning on dropping off a new logbook on <br>
the way up to the gathering in a couple of weeks. Floating Feather <br>
is a little hard to get in touch with, but she can pick up the old <br>
one on her next visit.<br>
<br>
     It's really neat to see how many stamps have made it into that <br>
logbook over the last couple of years.<br>
