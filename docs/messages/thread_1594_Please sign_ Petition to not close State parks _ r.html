---------- <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
undersigned express our support of state spending for Illinois State<br/>
Historic Sites and their staff. <br/>
<br/>
We find the proposed budget cuts by Rod Blagojevich to the funding of State<br/>
Historic Sites to be a deep blow to our collective cultural history and<br/>
understanding. We wish to express to the Governor, as well as the Illinois<br/>
General Assembly, that we value both a balanced budget as well as support<br/>
for our Historic and Cultural sites. <br/>
<br/>
The educational opportunities provided by our State Historic Sites is<br/>
invaluable. The support staff, which would be impacted severely by these<br/>
cuts, is an essential part of the cultural interpretation that these sites<br/>
provide to the public. <br/>
<br/>
We the undersigned do not support the budget cuts nor the closing of our<br/>
state parks proposed by Rod Blagojevich, and we ask you join us in defiance.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
