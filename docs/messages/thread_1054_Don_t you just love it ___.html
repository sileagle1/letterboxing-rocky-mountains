time difference during my flight.  Apparently the UK has their<br>
daylight savings time a week before we do so I missed the one in the<br>
UK and I will be in the UK during the one in the US--kinda funny, no?<br>
<br>
I do understand the "giddy" feeling though I can't wait to leave this<br>
afternoon.  I will email everyone after I get back from Wales.  Have a<br>
blast in Moab!!<br>
