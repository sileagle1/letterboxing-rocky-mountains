left us a surprise and we were so pleased!  We LOVED the hike and <br>
LOVED the clues!  I would encourage everyone up for a hike to find <br>
this one.  It was so beautiful and well worth the trip!  Just wanted <br>
to tell Eoghon, "THANKS"!  Isn't Letterboxing the "Meaning of <br>
Life?".  Autumn, can you post in the Main group that this LB is  <br>
a "fun" box with a hike that has beautiful views and is easy to <br>
find, but well hidden, for those traveling thru Colorado?<br>

follow them!  And, we were lead directly to the box without having <br>
to scrounge around, another plus!  The FTF surprise made it an extra <br>
fun "Father's Day"!  <br>
<br>
I want to apologize for misspelling your name....EGADS, I'm sorry, <br>
Eoghan! Thanks again...keep hiding them, we will come!<br>
