Hello all!<br>
<br>
Samurai and I got out this weekend (finally!) and found an Indian <br>
Chief and a Stegosaurus.<br>
<br>
Really lovely stamp, Es. I love your little journal too! And as we <br>
were leaving, a whole herd of elk were out near the fence, not 10 <br>
feet from where we were! Very cool.<br>
<br>
And we really enjoyed the hike up to the Stegosaurus, JelyBean. It <br>
was great to get out. Nothing like a hike up the side of a mountain <br>
to let you know how out of shape you are after the holiday. =3<br>
<br>
We wanted to get an Onion, but we ran out of light... Such is winter <br>
LBing!<br>
<br>
Thanks to all!<br>
<br>

Hey - good for you Ravenwolf.  I am waiting for better weather for <br>
these.   My favorite stamp so far is your "Master's Vision"  I did <br>
carve out a simple stamp the other day to celebrate my new grandson -<br>
 it was a humpty dumpty and I want to place it in his hometown in <br>
Indiana.  Well....I was babysitting with a dog - and I am sure it <br>
was her that chewed the stamp cause my dog would not do that AGAIN, <br>
I am sure.  I explained letterboxing to him very explicitly.  <br>
