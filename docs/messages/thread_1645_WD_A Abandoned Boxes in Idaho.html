                    <div class="plaintext-content">Currently the boxes that were listed as "abandoned" under WD'A have <br>
been placed under me on LBNA.  WD'A does great carvings and is very <br>
creative with her boxes.  She dropped out of letterboxing a few years <br>
ago.  Capperpillar and I have pulled some of the abandoned boxes <br>
(that were still alive) and are hoping that WD'A will come to the <br>
Gathering in January (we have been in contact with her daughter to <br>
see if we can spark the fire again) so we can help her update, re-<br>
carve and re-plant her boxes.  Some of the boxes we were able to <br>
confirm were indeed MIA and those I have updated with an MIA next to <br>
the box name on LBNA.  On Atlas Quest I have been updating the web-<br>
master with status changes as we have confirmed the status of some of <br>
her boxes although the boxes are still listed under her trail name on <br>
Atlas Quest.<br>
<br>
Until we meet up with WD'A I cannot guarantee that any of her boxes <br>
are currently alive and/or what condition they are in.  However, if <br>
you do manage to check on any of them yourself an update would be <br>
great.<br>
<br>
These are the boxes that were abandoned:<br>
<br>
Boy-O-Boy (Caldwell, Idaho)<br>
Treasure Shop Hop (Meridian, Idaho)<br>
Hit the Trail Series (Hidden Springs, Idaho)<br>
Friends (Garden City, Idaho)<br>
Huntmaster Series (Eagle, Idaho)<br>
Caribou (Eagle, Idaho)<br>
Apple Blossom (Boise, Idaho)<br>
Sweet Violet (Boise, Idaho)<br>
Amaryllis All Winter (Boise, Idaho)<br>
Tulip (Boise, Idaho)<br>
Princess Thumper (Boise, Idaho)<br>
Mother's Day (Boise, Idaho)<br>
Santa Mystery (This one is definitely MIA)<br>
<br>
One way or another we will try to get these great boxes back in <br>
action for everyone to enjoy this spring.  More details to come in <br>
2009.  <br>
