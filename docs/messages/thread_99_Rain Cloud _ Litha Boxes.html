Found Rain Cloud OK and in good shape.  Did not however find Litha.  <br/>
I searched that rock wall from the gate to the end on the ground and <br/>
from the top of the wall multiple times.  Anyone been able to confirm <br/>
this box recently?  Had an intense walk to get there but made it!!  <br/>
Autumn is very correct in that this is not a kid friendly box, but I <br/>
did see a kid going up-he was probably 8 or 9.  Definately walk this <br/>
trail before you try biking it!!  I think them mountain bikers are <br/>
crazzzzy!!  Saw lots of spatters on them rocks!!<br/>

PS:  I have been up to grab the Rock Crawler Microbox twice, but each <br/>
time has been a people haven.  I think that REM played there Sat &amp; <br/>
Sun when I was trying to get it.  Didn't have time to grab it this AM <br/>
as Trinity was at "school" (really a couple of mornings a week thing).<br/>

I found it alive and well on 8/5/03.  I had to climb the<br/>
wall a little to reach it and I put it back the way I found it.<br/>
