been the highest letterbox) is gone.  It was there about a year ago, <br/>
but I was there today and couldn't find it.  It does have a tendency to <br/>
move around a bit, but come on, if the placer can't find it, it's <br/>
missing.  I may replace it next time I am there, but I would not count <br/>
on that being any time soon.<br/>
<br/>
Good news.  There are several new letterboxes on the way to where <br/>
Altitude Sickness used to be.  As of this writing, four are published <br/>
(including three new ones), and one is not.  If you are heading to this <br/>
area, write me.<br/>
