Okay.  Well ... I looked for a mountain range, or something - but I  <br>

I came across this guy and thought .. Why not?<br>
So - I guess from time to time we'll change what's on the front page <br>

 No- Nothing but dead ends for me so far. Although I must say, I am <br>
having fun turning that document around and around.<br>
<br>
    I am assuming no-one has found it yet. But I have nothing to base <br>
that on. That is why I was wondering when the "number of boxes" went <br>
to zero. <br>

I emailed Randy once about it and he had thought that no one had found it.<br>
But I didnt ask him about number of boxes.  You could email him about.<br>
He wont give ANY clues tho.<br>
