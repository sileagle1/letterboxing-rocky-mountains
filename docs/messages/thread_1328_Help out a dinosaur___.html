                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello, Denverites.  I recently got a note that the journal for SoC#: <br>
Stegosaurus near Morrison is about full.  I plan to replace it next <br>
time I go up to the Denver area, but who knows when that will be?  In <br>
the meantime, if anyone happens to be meandering by that box and <br>
would like to replace the log or add to it for me, I'd be most <br>
grateful.<br>
<br>
Remember, though, JeLyBean boxes are small, my logbooks are about <br>
2.5" square.  I usually just cut them out of copy paper, punch two <br>
holes near the top about 1.5" apart, and bind them together between <br>
two pieces of card stock with brass fasteners.  So, you could just <br>
unfasten the fasteners, keep the card stock covers, and replace the <br>
paper inside, if you wanted, or just simply add a few sheets to the <br>
end.<br>
<br>
For these acts of kindness, I usually offer a hitchhiker, if I have <br>
one, clues to an unpublished box, if you don't already know about <br>
them, or a free hint for one of my harder boxes like the Cypher <br>
Series or Big Brain.<br>
<br>
If you could help, much thanks.<br>

As the First Finder of this box, and living just south of it, I feel <br>
I MUST jump in and offer boxside assistance!  We'd be more than happy <br>
to replace the journal for you....we'll bring our paper, hole punch, <br>
and scissors to make sure it fits!  We'll let you know when it's done!<br>

Hugs, Peach<br>

journal and had intended on mailing you the original, BUT, there are <br>
still about 25 pages left!  So, Cappy and I decided to leave the <br>
original and wrote Stegasaurus Journal #2 on the one I brought and <br>
asked boxers to fill the first one before stamping in the second.  <br>
When you hear that it's full, we'll go up and get it and mail it to <br>
you then.  It's in great condition!  We had brought up extra stuff <br>
just in case, but, it didn't need anything!  It's kinda crazy because <br>
it has our original stamp in it back from 2004!  So, we stamped in <br>
the new journal so you'll have the newest Peach and Cappy stamp.  It <br>
seemed weird to see that old stamp of ours.  Dorkiness!!! BTW, they <br>
are closing that road to vehicles because they are adding an on ramp <br>
at Alameda and C-470! But, if boxers follow the clues, they'll have <br>
no problems getting it.<br>

What a gorgeous day today!  WOOT!  Can Spring finally be here???<br>
