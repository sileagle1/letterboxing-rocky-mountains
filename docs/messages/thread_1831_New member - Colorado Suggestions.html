times and I can tell you my favorite family places to go.  Basically you could drive a square route around Colorado and hit many great places.  Go up I25 to Colorado Springs where you could spend 2 or 3 days exploring Garden Of The Gods, driving up Pikes Peak, etc.  Then head north past Denver to Rocky Mt. NP, where you should spend at least 3 days hiking and driving scenic roads.  Then head west on I70 to Vail where you can rent mountain bikes and take ski lifts up the mountain and ride down.  Then head south through Leadville and west to Aspen where you can visit the Maroon Bells, another scenic area to hike.  Then continue west and north to Glenwood Springs where you can hike to Hanging Lake, see Doc Holiday's grave and swim in a huge pool heated by hot springs.  Go south on Hwy 50 and Hwy 550 to Ouray where you can see waterfalls and swim in hot springs in this beautiful town.  Backtrack and go west to Telluride where you can hike to waterfalls and ride free ski lifts up to the mountain above town.  Head southwest to Mesa Verde NP to see awesome ruins, then east to Durango where you can ride the train to Silverton and take a raft trip.  Head east to Pagosa Springs, then south into New Mexico to Santa Fe and Albuquerque, then east on I40 to Texas or south for more fun in New Mexico.  There are letterboxes in most of these places.<br>
Have fun!<br>

> Hi!  I just joined this list today.  We (AndPlus2) are Texas boxers and are members of that yahoo list.  We are traveling to Colorado this summer (July) on vacation for about 12 or 13 days (including driving days).  We will be spending time in the Gunnison area, but we want to do a little traveling around.  We know we'd like to ride the train between Durango and Silverton, but there are so many other options and we want to choose wisely.  We have two children, so we need family friendly things.  We welcome any suggestions you have to offer to us regarding activities, must-see attractions, and boxing in Colorado.  We are looking forward to finding some Colorado boxes to add to our logbooks!<br>
