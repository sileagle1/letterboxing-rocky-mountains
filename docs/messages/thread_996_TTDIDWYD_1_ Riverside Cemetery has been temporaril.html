boxes!  Both GME and Riverside are great fun and I hope you are able to <br>
get them back into action before the weather warms up and a <br>
new "season" of boxing begins!  We hope we can get to Unsinkable soon!<br>

hard hat guys tearing up the landscape!  What did they think when they <br>
ran across GME...that is was a sandwich and part of their lunchbox???)<br>

I'm being extra careful by pulling this one, still smarting from the <br>
sting of the loss of GME (which I will prolly replace, but not for a <br>
bit.)  I think Riverside probably would have been ok, but there are <br>
bright orange construction markings VERY close to its hiding place.  <br>
Looks like a worker also found my box while doing work, and as you <br>
know, this stamp was a LOT of work, though it hasn't been visited by a <br>
boxer since late Nov.<br>
<br>
This box WILL be back.<br>
