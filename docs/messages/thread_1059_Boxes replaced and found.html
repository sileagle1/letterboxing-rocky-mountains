                    <div class="plaintext-content">For all of those interested, today I replaced Benjamin Whedbee and Abner Loomis in Fort Collins.  Each should be in safer places than before....hopefully.  I also pulled Water Wagon to place in a different location since many people said that it was hard to get to due to the gate being locked and homeowners near by.  Joseph Mason will be replaced soon as I could not today with a police officer sitting in the parking lot.<br>
<br>
Coyote Ridge is a great hike but I would recommend allowing at least 3 hours and no small children.  4th graders could possibly do it.  I would also say that the hike seemed much longer than 1.6 miles each way, but maybe it's just me.  Great spot though and certainly the longest hike in Northern Colorado.<br>
