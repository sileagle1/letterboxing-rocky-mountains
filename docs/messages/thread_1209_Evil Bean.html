I have never heard of an Evil Bean box either. I've referred to <br>
JeLyBean as Evil because working on some of his clues is basically <br>
torture. Don't let his pink sweetness fool you!<br>

I have heard of a few WOM clues in Colorado, but I think they have <br>
all been released to regular members of this list. It's possible that <br>
I'm out of the loop on a few, though. WOM clues wouldn't work for me. <br>
I get way too few visitors down here as it is. <br>

<br>
I think urban boxes are exciting, with all the covert manuevers that <br>
a person needs. But I'm just about as far from an urban environment <br>
as I can get. A few years ago I found myself hotel bound for weeks in <br>
the Mile High City with tons of time on my hands. But alas, I had <br>
never heard of letterboxing back then.<br>
<br>
y-nought, eagerly awaiting PRE's feindish new letterbox clues (unless <br>
I already missed them somehow).....<br>
