   <br>
  This is probably a good time to introduce myself to the group also.<br>
  I recently moved to SLC from the Chicago area!  We love it here!  I haven't had a chance to go boxing yet, as almost everything I own is still packed up in boxes and I can't find some of my Letterboxing stuff   :-(   <br>
  I'm definitely going to try to get up to the Twin Falls gathering in July, so I hope to meet some of you there!<br>
   <br>
  I was happy to see that I recognize some of your names from the Postal group!<br>
   <br>
  AND, I am SERIOUSLY BUMMED that we live so far from a real ren faire!  We lived 5 minutes from the Bristol faire back in the midwest, so this year we are going through faire withdrawel.  We are going to try to hit some of the smaller faires within driving distance though...  it looks like Grand Junction has one in the fall that we are going to try to make.<br>
   <br>
  Happy letterboxing,<br>
  Howling Coyote<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

Welcome Howling Coyote!<br>
<br>
Yes, I recognize your trail name from postals.  I also have some good<br>
postal friends from the Chicago area.<br>
<br>
CW Sun Seeker and I are trying to negotiate an exchange (if not some<br>
actual letterboxing) with Rick in Boca while he is here - a daunting<br>
task so far what with 3 challenging schedules to coordinate. [:-?]   I<br>
wonder if we might try bringing you into the fray!  What say you?  If<br>
you're interested, email me privately.<br>

Welcome to the RM list!  The Chicago area really has<br>
some good boxes.  I was there in February and I found<br>
Chicago's Wild Parakeets and Chicago Underground.  I<br>
would have loved to find more, but I couldn't feel my<br>
fingers anymore!!<br>
<br>
Enjoy the list - this is a fun group!<br>
