YOUR AGE BY CHOCOLATE MATH<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is pretty neat.<br>
<br>
DON'T CHEAT BY SCROLLING DOWN FIRST!<br>
It takes less than a minute.<br>
Work this out as you read ...<br>
Be sure you don't read the bottom until you've worked it out!<br>
 it's fun.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. First of all, pick the number of times a week that you would like <br>
to have chocolate <br>
(more than once but less than 10)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Multiply this number by 2 (just to be bold)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Add 5<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Multiply it by 50 -- I'll wait while you get the calculator <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
5. If you have already had your birthday this year add 1756 ....<br>
If you haven't, add 1755.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6. Now subtract the four digit year that you were born.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You should have a three digit number <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The first digit of this was your original number<br>
(i.e., how many times you want to have chocolate each week).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The next two numbers are <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
YOUR AGE! (Oh YES, it is!!!!!)<br>
<br>

THIS IS THE ONLY YEAR (2006) IT WILL EVER WORK, SO SPREAD IT AROUND <br>
WHILE IT LASTS.<br>

Pre...what route are you taking?  Are you following I-70 all the way <br>
to Moab?<br>
If so....Zeb Gump Grizzly Creek may be open. Zeb Gump Doc Holliday.. <br>
depends on the snow in Glenwood.  You could decide after you see what <br>
it's like when you get into the area.   I know that Zeb Gump Mustang <br>
and 16 ton are clear (although make sure the road to Mustang isn't <br>
muddy!).  <br>
Jimmy Buffet and Talk Like a Pirate (same park), all the Napolean <br>
Dynamites (very easy to get all three in short time.. Lucky!!), Raft <br>
the River is a drive by, Pie Eating Contest and There Were These Two <br>
Guys (same park), Big Fish, Rocky Mountain Retro Candy (a little bit <br>
of a walk to do the series but not a difficult one), Grand Valley, <br>
Johnny Carino's, Commuting, Those Were the Days.. all of those are <br>
clear as of right now.  <br>
<br>
None of the ones that have the city of Mesa or Grand Mesa as the <br>
closest are free of snow yet. <br>
<br>
Y-nought's No Use should be clear... it may be too far in the wrong <br>
direction for you depending on your itinerary and route.  You might <br>
look at a map to get an idea. <br>
<br>
If you take the 'back' road into Moab you'll hit quite a few boxes <br>
along that road.  Rather than go all the way down the highway to the <br>
regular Moab exit, you take the small exit before it that says Cisco <br>
and head for the river.  The first box (The Westerns)is at the Dewey <br>
Bridge.. which is immediately after you hit the river...and then <br>
there are bunches all along the road all the way to Moab!  Don't miss <br>
Y-Nought's Alien Gothic.. it's one of my favorite boxes ever.  And <br>
then there are like a BAJILLION in Moab!  Woohoo!<br>
<br>
If I missed any someone shout it out.  Oh, I know.. there's the <br>
airport one which doesn't have posted clues.  If you want to try it <br>
let me know and I'll direct you via email.  <br>
<br>
If you want suggestions as to what order to do the Grand Junction <br>
boxes in to get to them in a sort of geographical order let me know.  <br>
And if you aren't coming through Grand Junction have a wonderful time <br>
anyway!<br>
<br>
Es, singing a little song about chocolate pie<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yep I-70 over to Cisco, but after work the day I leave.  If I can <br>
get out of Denver earlier than usual and have some daylight on the <br>
Western Slope I may be able to snag more than I think.  Still <br>
deciding about route back.<br>
<br>
I'lll be camping along the CO river about 10 miles outta Moab next  -<br>
 weather permitting. I LOVE that road in from Cisco and have already <br>
plotted out the ones along there to snag.  Hwy 128 has to be one of <br>
the most fantastic roads in the whole country...along with 550 in <br>
CO.  Anyone know what that road is looking like south of Ouray, by <br>
chance???<br>
<br>
Good to know about the Grand Mesa snow situation, already had Doc <br>
Holliday on the list. <takes notes about the others>  Had already <br>
enjoyed reading up on the history behind the Westerns...<br>
<br>
A bajillion in Moab is right!  I hope I can use my past road trip <br>
experience to be organized about it. <br>
<br>
Knowing me, I'll prolly need a vacation after my vacaction when I <br>
get back....but considering we usually go to Moab for 4th of July, <br>
at least it shouldn't be 100 degrees!<br>
<br>
Thanks for the boxing advice!<br>
