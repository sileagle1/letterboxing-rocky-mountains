&gt; A-MAZE-ing Letterbox Event<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Meridian, Idaho Letterboxing Event <br/>
&gt; Sign Up Today at Atlas Quest to Attend: http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=1442<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Friday, October 23, 2009<br/>
&gt; 6:00 p.m. 10:00 p.m.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You'll find all treats and no tricks at the "A-MAZE-ing Letterbox Event" Friday, October 23rd at Linder Farms in Meridian, Idaho. Join the Capperpillar Clan and myself for lots of A-MAZE-ing fun! After a quick exchange and nabbing the Event Stamp image you will be set free to find a wide variety of Halloween inspired boxes on the 15 acre farm complete with a challenging search for hidden boxes in the corn maze, free hay rides and an expansive pumpkin patch that might just be home to the Famous Great Pumpkin. Don't forget to visit the petting zoo and the little tykes straw maze.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hosted by: Blackvelvetrav &amp; Capperpillar<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Location: Linder Farms - 7165 S Linder Road, Meridian, ID 83642<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Directions: Linder Road is only one mile west of the Kuna/Meridian Highway (Hwy 69), and they are halfway between Lake Hazel and Columbia Roads.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tips to make your event experience comfortable and fun: This is a farm and the uneven ground is comprised of dirt, fallen corn stalks, weeds and rocks. Tennis shoes or hiking boots are your best footwear options. Wear long pants that can get dirty (like jeans) to cover your legs as weeds may have thorns and the vines/pumpkin stems can be prickly. It is cool in the evening a jacket and/or sweater are recommended. You will be hunting for hidden boxes in the dark so flashlights and/or headlamps are highly recommended. Although there are large lights at the farm they are not strong enough to illuminate the paths in the corn maze adequately for you to navigate your way around. And of course bring along your LB supplies (signature stamp, pens, ink, compass, gloves etc.) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cost: Entrance to the farm is free and the hayride is free. Some boxes will be hidden in locations that do not cost anything to search for. If you would like to search for the boxes in the corn maze you will want to mention the internet price. The cost for the corn maze is $4.00 per person + tax (regular price is $8 for non internet prices). Kids three and under are free.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
