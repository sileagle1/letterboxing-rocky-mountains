Oh crud, I wish I hadn't read that.  Hungry now.<br>
<br>
Just got back from Red Rock Canyon Park, a relatively new area they <br>
opened up here in the Springs, just south of the Garden of the <br>
Gods.  It is still under development, but there are some pretty good <br>
trails available and a lot of cool stuff to see, old quarry, couple <br>
of small lakes, cool red sandstone formations a la the Garden <br>
itself.  Oh, and did I mention there's two letterboxes there?  Well, <br>
two letterboxes and a liiiittle something extra now.<br>
<br>
JeLyBean, wondering if I can get a fresh pumpkin this time of year...<br>
