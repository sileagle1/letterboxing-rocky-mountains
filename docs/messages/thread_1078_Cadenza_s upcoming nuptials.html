I'm trying to indoctrinate him, but he seems to think that it all sounds<br/>
pretty wierd.  It's funny because I got him all excited when I told him that<br/>
the SciFi network is starting to show Dr. Who.  He and his friend are quite<br/>
into Dr. Who and he got all excited about the possibility that I would enjoy<br/>
it.  He made me swear that I would watch the series.  I told him that I<br/>
would watch an episode if he would go out letterboxing at least once with<br/>
me, to which there was much moaning and groaning!!  It was pretty funny, but<br/>
I think I have him caught into at least one trip.<br/>

My sister's husband really doesn't care for letterboxing at all, but she<br/>
works out bribes here and there.  The Catamount Carvers work as a team<br/>
and everybody loves it (most of the time), so we count ourselves as<br/>
pretty lucky.  Maybe you could create a spoof letterbox on Dr. Who for<br/>
his first box.  Maybe that would hook him!  We'll keep our fingers<br/>
crossed for a successful indoctrination!<br/>

Silent Wings, who doesn't have a clue who Dr. Who is ................ The<br/>
Catamount Carvers live in the land of no television reception, and we<br/>
tend to be clueless about more than a few things .... Cirrus thought he<br/>
saw somebody drinking Dr. Pepsi the other day!!!<br/>

Now I'm imagining the possibilities for Andrew . . . wondering where I could<br/>
find some good, carvable Dr. Who images.  I will have to look this one up.<br/>
Maybe I could plant them here for when he comes to visit in the summer and<br/>
make it some amazing spot that he would never forget.  I would need some<br/>
help building a good story line and clue that fits so cleverly that he would<br/>
be charmed by the whole thing. hmmm. . . this might just work, but it will<br/>
take some work.  It could be a pretty fun series though.<br/>

Andrew's going on at least one letterbox adventure!  I'm watching Dr. Who as<br/>
we speak for the first time.  He said he would letterbox if I did it, and so<br/>
I did!!  Mwahaha!  Letterboxing, here we come!  Now to choose the boxes!<br/>
-and he thought I wouldn't hold him to it!!  I always hold people to their<br/>
