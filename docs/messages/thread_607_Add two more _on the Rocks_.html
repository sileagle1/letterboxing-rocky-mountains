Hi All!<br>
<br>
Add two more "on the Rocks"!  (Dixie and Ron...now using trail names <br>
of Dixie Peach and Cappy!).  We weren't sure if we could make it, so, <br>
I didn't post.  But, we're able to go and we're so excited!  Looking <br>
forward to meeting you all and putting some faces with those boxes <br>
we've found!  Whoo-hoo!  <br>
<br>
Also, we planted our first box, "It's a Small, Small World".  Hope to <br>
see your stamps in it this season!<br>
<br>
Hugs, Dixie Peach<br>

  Hi Lisa!  Yes, we'll see you there!  Do you remember we met at the <br>
  first gathering at Roxborough?  Our stamps are our first attempt at <br>
  carving and needs some improvement!  Ha!  Maybe we can get some tips <br>
  from all you expert carvers while we're in Moab!  But, we've been <br>
  boxing since 2002 and LOVE the hunt, so please forgive those of us <br>
  whose talent doesn't include carving!  :)<br>

Woot! Dixie Peach and Cappy AND Tie Dye Girl and friend! I'm starting <br>
to think like Cadenza and might just grab a spare logbook.<br>

We all have our fingers crossed for you Cadenza. I'm hoping you hit <br>

remember, there will be pie.<br>

  Lisa!  I LOVE your TDG stamp, I can't believe it's your 1st hand <br>
  carved stamp, you did a GREAT job!  We notice every time you beat us <br>
  to a box, which is usually!  Ha!  <br>

  y-nought....you owe us a special piece of pie after you put us to <br>

Yes, we have the Onion and WOW, do I have a story for you, but not <br>
until after you find it.  If you have time, find it before the trip <br>
to Moab so I can share the story with you!  Y-nought knows my story, <br>
but I don't want to give anything away,although, I doubt anyone can <br>
beat this story!  YOW!  It gave me a few more grey hairs!<br>

flights that day unless I can make a funny humming noise and go to <br>
my happy place in my mind, which would be the pie table at the park <br>

  Yes, we have the Onion and WOW, do I have a story for you, but not <br>
  until after you find it.  If you have time, find it before the trip <br>
  to Moab so I can share the story with you!  Y-nought knows my story, <br>
  but I don't want to give anything away,although, I doubt anyone can <br>
  beat this story!  YOW!  It gave me a few more grey hairs!<br>
<br>
  Hugs, Dixie<br>
