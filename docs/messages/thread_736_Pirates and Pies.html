Batten down the hatches and hide yer valuables on the weekend of <br>
July 23 and 24 for pirates and kilted rascals will be about!  <br>
<br>
Aside from the dates of that weekend, we haven't set a schedule in <br>
stone yet.  If everyone wants to go to the faire, then there you <br>
go.  If some of you want to come but not enter the faire (be ye <br>
mad?!), there is a park nearby where we just might have a picnic or <br>
some such civilized thing. I know the Nought's have some letterboxes <br>
on their wanted list and I sense much stamping and fun.  <br>
<br>
I know the dates aren't going to work for everyone and I apologize <br>
for that.  That's just the only time we could get all the moons and <br>
stars and work schedules aligned for travel from our corners of the <br>
state. <br>
<br>
If you're interested in coming, shout it out and the plans will <br>
begin to form!<br>

I have won the tournament the last few years and they have one of the nicer prizes so how can I not play? Hmmm, I guess we will have to see how the schedule pans out for this one.
