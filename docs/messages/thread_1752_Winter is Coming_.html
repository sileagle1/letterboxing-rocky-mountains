<br>
The Evergreen Nature Center will be open on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays through 10/31.  After 10/31, the Evergreen Nature Center letterbox won't be available until next April.  I'll be there this Saturday afternoon, October 10th, if anyone would like to stop by, get a letterbox and say 'hi'.<br>
<br>
I'll also be pulling the 2009 Big Bison HHH on 11/1.  If you want to stop by and grab some HHs before I pull it, feel free. If you take any, please give move them along to boxes that are accessible in the winter months.  Also make sure you don't take the Big Bison stamp by mistake. <br>
<br>
Happy Boxing!<br>
