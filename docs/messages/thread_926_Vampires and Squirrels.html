<br>
I need to tell everyone that this box is a letterboxers MUST HAVE!  It <br>
is AWESOME!  Aljan, all of your boxes are very special, but, this one <br>
is very, very cool!  And yes, we were up there at night, with those <br>
second finders....my son and his girlfriend...Robothouse and Miss <br>
Chickie...my son lives in Longmont and we met them there for their <br>
first box...and I told them too that they are spoiled to have such a <br>
wonderful FIRST box, and BTW, we gave them them the FIRST <br>
FINDERS...anyway, I digress....<br>
<br>
We had flashlights, think flashlights and cemetery and purported <br>
vampires and then have a squirrel JUMP out of the hiding place at you <br>
unexpectedly! It nearly ran up Cappy's arm!  We all jumped and laughed <br>
too hard!  We wondered if modern vampires take on the look of <br>
squirrels instead of bats!  Ha!  What a crazy, fun, night!  <br>
<br>
Okay, all you boxers, you MUST HAVE this box before the squirrel takes <br>
it to another hiding spot!  Have I ever lead you astray???  JUST DO <br>
IT, me hearties!<br>
<br>
Hugs, Dread Peach <br>
P.S. Thanks again, Aljan for the adventure and reward!!!  Silent <br>
Wings, we were looking out for ye...we expected YOU to jump out from <br>
the bushes, but not a squirrel to jump out of the tree!  Ha!  LOL<br>

You are not easily losing your reputation with Nimbus and Cirrus<br>
(formerly Kapu).  We got there a couple days after you.  No squirrel for<br>
us!  You're very lucky that I forgot to keep track of the expected plant<br>
date and was not keeping watch for the clues to pop up, because we would<br>
have raced you for it.  AND, you really wouldn't want to chance meeting<br>
up with us in a cemetery at night.  Three of us four Catamounts have<br>
Romanian blood and we were dying to sink our teeth into that box!<br>

Oh, you guys are just the best.  Thanks!  I am glad that everyone is enjoying the box!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Maybe it's evolution...  maybe vampires have decided over time that a cute, cuddly squrirell (although I am sure that it seemed like furry death when it came flying out of that hole in the dark) is a better approach than bats in a public relations kinda way.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
...but you know, I don't mind bats so much, so *shrugs*<br>
