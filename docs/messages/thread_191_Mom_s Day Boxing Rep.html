Mom with us and got a new convert!!  Went and snagged Tigger.  This <br/>
place is extremly busy!!  Went to go and get Oh Dear, but my Miss <br/>
Trinity Jah decided to run in front of a bicycle so we had to leave <br/>
when she decided to throw a tantrum.  PLEASE NOTE:  This place was <br/>
super busy!!  People everywhere on foot, on bike, on blades.  Watch <br/>
your kids!!  The guy, with his kids right behind him, was going way <br/>
to fast for given conditions (I am pretty sure he was over the POSTED <br/>
15mph since he locked up his brakes), not to mention the very rude <br/>
comment of something along the lines of "Good Job Mom".  I have taken <br/>
a lot of time in teaching my daughter "the rules of the road" so to <br/>
speak. But, as with most kids excitement got the best of her.  The <br/>
guy had at least 100 yards of visability and certainly had plenty of <br/>
time to see that there was a little kid walking along the bike path.  <br/>
SO my point is just to watch your kids and teach them the best you <br/>
can.  Now back to your report!!  After visiting a furniture store  we <br/>
decided that we could do another box and went and visited Woody The <br/>
Beaver.  He is doing great, but I worry about the moisture with no <br/>
baggy.  Probably won't have much moisture but definately something to <br/>
think about.  My mom has decided that we will try and do this every <br/>
weekend.  What took her so long!!  I've been going for about a year <br/>
and she has known about it the whole time!!  Well, thanks for letting <br/>
me ramble!!  Talk to ya all soon!!<br/>

<br/>
I agree with the comment about Woody not being in a baggie... but the<br/>
container was too small to put it all in a baggie... I just have to hope<br/>
for the best =]  Any snake sitings?<br/>
<br/>
You are right about where Tigger &amp; Oh Dear are... the park is always<br/>
busy... and the bikers are very irresponsible.  They ride as if they are<br/>
out on the road where 25-30 mph is ok.  Sadly, the sidewalk they are on<br/>
is designated for people and bikes.  I can't tell you how many times I<br/>
have had to pull my 3 year old daughter out of the path of some biker<br/>
who has just sped past a walker and is on the WRONG side of the path.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope your little one is ok!<br/>
<br/>
