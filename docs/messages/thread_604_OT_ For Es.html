Perhaps a T to wear while doing some boxing?<br>

plant a letterbox on a beach with a hurricane coming!!  I ran around<br>
the beach and collected some shells to keep in a letterbox (I've never<br>

the Salt Lake Valley, since that is where she grew up.  I will call it<br>
the "Relocation Letterbox."  It was a fun adventure just getting out<br>

I'm certain that your sister appreciated how lovely a thought this was.<br>
Thank you for sharing with us. Oh! Is the stamp up on your blog?<br>
