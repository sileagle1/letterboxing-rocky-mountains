Hi Scott -<br/>
  just got back fron the hand doctor - unfortunately I had developed an infection under the nail and it basically spread to the point it overcame the good healing I had.  Now I go in this afternoon for the surgery to do the revision - I think the name Stubby is going to stick.  Oh well, I suppose there are much worse things to have happen. Talk with you later.<br/>
p.s. - many thanks for all the good wishes from the letterboxer crowd.  Definitely a lot of very nice folks.   Tom<br/>

Stubby has a great attitude!  True, it could be worse - good advice<br/>
for all of us - and we are all good to keep that in mind.  <br/>
<br/>
Tom, I am still confident that you will be able to alter your<br/>
procedures, both professionally and personally, and adapt to this new<br/>
situation.  I'm still thinking of you every day and hoping for the<br/>
best outcome possible.  Keep us posted.  Hang in there!<br/>
