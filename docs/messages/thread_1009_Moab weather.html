I was wondering what the weather in Moab is the last week of March.  Was thinking of coming over to box and camp with my kids for spring break. Is it a crazy week there then?<br>

Nobody should ever, and I mean NEVER EVER come to Moab the entire <br>

disappears into the backcountry and several choice sites where it is <br>
common to sit and watch the drunk drivers roll and smash their <br>
jeeps, but in the late afternoon and evening town is in total <br>
gridlock. Added to it this year is the fact that they are doing a <br>

patrol has a fleet of helicopters on constant patrol of the trails <br>
all around the area. They zoom all around and it echos up and down <br>
the canyons!<br>

The weather at the end of March can be anything from hot, 80 degree <br>
sunny days to snowing out! You never know from day to day. It is <br>
common to have 50 to 60 degree differences from early morning to <br>
evening. If you come then, bring lots of layers, including shorts. <br>
The weather should be more predictable after Easter break, but if <br>
you come before the break, the "season" is still quiet and you <br>
should have the trails pretty much to yourself.<br>

How exciting!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was hoping to make it down to Moab in April, but it looks as if I won't be<br>
able to after all.  I'm actually going to Wales to spend the week with a<br>
dear friend.  That definitely shot my vacation time and I won't be back<br>
until April 9th.  It is actually looking as if I may not have decent<br>
vacation time saved for a while.  I will likely be making other trips out to<br>
the UK later as well.  I feel my letterboxing time slipping away and the<br>
snow hasn't even gone yet!  It is all for good reasons though, so I hope you<br>
all will forgive me.  I so wanted to meet those that weren't there last<br>
time.  I'm still missing certain pirateish stamps.<br>

are more than willing to go boxing with anyone and everyone!  (I <br>

GREAT boxes here, and some amazing hikes, as I'm sure you know.  We <br>
may even have some pie to try to lure others here as well.  <br>
Yummmmm!  See you soon!<br>

I've been printing and organizing clues like crazy and do see how <br>
many fab boxes I have to look forward to :-) Can I DO them all in my <br>

As time gets closer I'll drop ya'll a line and see if we can at least <br>
meet up.<br>
