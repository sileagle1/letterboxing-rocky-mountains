I lived in Tucson for about a decade doing that higher education thing. <br/>
I love it there and have done some boxing on visits.  Did you get to<br/>
search for any boxes?  Kristal (of Kristal and Ron) is delightful and<br/>
talented.  The boys and I met her for dinner and did an exchange. <br/>
Azroadie does nice boxes too, but haven't met him/her/them.<br/>
