Today I went and found a letterbox that Rose Girl, my daughter, planted <br>
for me for Father's Day. Her first plant. Sniff. They grow up so fast...<br>

Anyway, I was surprised to find the first finder prize was cookies. <br>
Shortbread to be exact. How awesome is that? (I was even more surprised <br>
a bear had not eaten my Father's Day letterbox in the week or so it has <br>
been there.) Ever found edibles in a letterbox?<br>
<br>
Anyway, the Happy Father's Day cookie box will be a semi-private box <br>
because there are, like, two pages in the log book. But, if you are in <br>
CO Springs with a couple of hours to kill and are looking for a <br>
challenging summer hike with some refreshing water fun at the end, let <br>
me know and I'll send you the clues. You may have to bring your own log <br>

Yep, we found candy in a box once and we were surprised that nothing had chewed through that box.  Sometimes boxes get eaten without any tempting smells wafting out of them.  Remember the story about  one of y-nought's boxes and a marmot?  Esmerelda even memorialized the happening with a box planted up on Grand Mesa.<br>

I found a box today that wasn't as lucky as your Father's Day <br>
letterbox.  Some creature did significant damage while looking for the <br>
ccokies inside.  The planter of this box will receive the contents <br>
back by mail next week in a more "bear-proof" container.  Thankfully a <br>
human put the box upside down in a safe area and nothing inside was <br>
hurt.  Sorry I had to pull it from the field, but it seemed too <br>
damaged to let it stay exposed to the elements.<br>

Check the photo out in the "CookieBox" photos folder.<br>

"Cchomp! Have a hole in your box.. didn't remoVE the box, just part <br>

signed the logbook...<br>
