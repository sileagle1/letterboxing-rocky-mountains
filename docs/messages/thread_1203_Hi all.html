<br>
We are so happy to find you! We have been letterboxing for only a <br>
couple of months, but have already had so much fun! We even placed our <br>
first box last weekend. This weekend we went to check on it, and <br>
happened to find someone in the act of stamping in. What fun!<br>
<br>
I'm anxious to get to know all of you whose boxes I've been visiting! <br>
Ravenwolf's "Master's Vision" and Preboxed's "Roadside Incident" have <br>
been our favorite's so far. :) (Except for Super Uno guy, which was <br>
our very first find and practically in our backyard, and therefore <br>
very exctiting...)<br>
