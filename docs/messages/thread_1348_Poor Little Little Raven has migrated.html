                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got a message from some boxers who went up to visit Little Raven <br/>
yesterday.  He was not under his rock.  They started searching around <br/>
and he was placed about six feet away.  Those of you who have done this <br/>
box know exactly where he is and who he is keeping company <br/>
with.  ::rolls eyes::<br/>
<br/>
If someone is going to be up there could you move him back to where <br/>
he's supposed to be?  I'd surely appreciate it!  If not we'll let him <br/>
visit for now and I'll yank him out next time I'm there!<br/>
<br/>
Es, wondering how many boxes go missing but are actually just rehidden <br/>
in the wrong spot<br/>
