                    <div class="plaintext-content">Once upon a time just a short while ago a Bean was visiting Durango.  <br>
Being a good letterboxer, he went up to Animas Overlook to nab all of <br>
the boxes there. <br>
 <br>
Eventually he found Olga's box but, much to his dismay, when he <br>
opened the box he found it full of geotrash and Olga's stamp was <br>
missy!  Quick as a .. uh... quick person... he messaged Es of the <br>
dilema. <br>
 <br>
Es zoomed over to the geocaching site at Atlas Quest and sent up an <br>
SOS.  Within minutes someone had located the intended cache AND the <br>
cacher who had 'found only one thing, left lots'.  They had been up <br>
there in the dark!  Scary!<br>
<br>
So, Es sent a nice note to the cacher saying how much Olga missed her <br>
mule.  First the cacher wrote back something like, I don't know what <br>
you're talking about.  Uh oh.  But then she wrote, oh, you mean that <br>
hand carved rubber stamp mounted on a slab of tree that's been there <br>
for four years that I traded a used pencil for?  Okay, she didn't say <br>
that, but she did say, oh, I remember, the stamp of a mule. I will be <br>
happy to give it back to you.  I meant no harm.  It was dark. <br>
 <br>
After a few emails, she decided she would feel best if she took it <br>
back herself.  So now Olga has her mule back and the box is open for <br>
business.<br>

Yes! I have confirmed that Olga and her mule are back and busy <br>
Overlooking.<br>

If you have time when you are here in September send me a <br>
note.....maybe we can meet up for an exchange (and/or some delicious <br>
pie).<br>
