<br/>
Someone reported finding Rocky Mountain Clydesdales, so it's still <br/>
there safe and sound and not lost as feared!<br/>
And Lionsmane found Animas River in Durango which had been reported <br/>
missing!<br/>
AND I received my diploma awarding me the title of Doctor of <br/>
Thinkology!<br/>
Is this a great hobby or what?<br/>
<br/>
Woohoo!<br/>
<br/>
Es, figuring the Borgs had been using some kind of evil cloaking <br/>
device or something to disguise those boxes<br/>
