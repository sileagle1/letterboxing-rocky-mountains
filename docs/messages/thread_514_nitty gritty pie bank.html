Something for Es in Grand Junction?!  :::pounds head on desk in <br/>
Denver and whines at Skeech to get back to the right side of the <br/>
mountains:::  I have a dollar twenty seven all ready to go.. woot!<br/>
<br/>
I can't believe I didn't notice that the url had part of it cut <br/>
off.. must have been pie overdose or something.  Thanks, y... that, <br/>
of course, took me right to it.  I'm afraid my kids don't know too <br/>
much about the Neutrons... they're 26 and 28. <g>  But they like <br/>
pie.  We're all pretty big pumpkin fans, too, JB.  We may not know <br/>
all the cartoons, but we know pie.  mmmmm.... pie. <br/>
<br/>
That was so close, Y!  Man.. I was waiting for you to tell us that <br/>
you found it!  Next year. <br/>
<br/>
Es, ready to zoom home <br/>

me????<br/>
&gt; We could serve pumpkin, lemon merangue, all sorts of pie!<br/>
