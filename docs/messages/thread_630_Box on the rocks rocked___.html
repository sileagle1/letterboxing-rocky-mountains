We had so much fun meeting everyone, getting all inky fingered with the stamp exchange and boxing around Moab.  I loved meeting everyone!  We found some great boxes out there...  my FAV was Kat's Dourown Panel box.  Might be my favorite find ever so far!  Fun beng a first finder for the snowshoe kokopelli!  It was SO fun to meet everybody and I wlll look forward to doing it again soon and meeting everyone out there on the trail!<br>
 <br>
Y, the event stamp is fabulous!  Thank you so much!<br>
 <br>
Kat, the event box...  wow.  What more should I say?  WOW!<br>
