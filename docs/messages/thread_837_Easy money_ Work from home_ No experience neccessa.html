 What timeframe are you looking at again? I haven't been following dates <br/>
since I can't break away again this summer. If I can, I may get something <br/>
off to you. I don't have a box in CO yet! By the way, I planted two new ones <br/>
in UT (in Salt Lake Valley) yesterday.<br/>

&gt; For all the boxers who can't make it to the gathering, and all the<br/>
&gt; boxers who can...we need some more plants over here for people to find<br/>
&gt; that weekend! (People meaning ME! Arrrr!) The Buccaneers be payin' a<br/>
&gt; dollar.. CASH MONEY... per box!! WOOT!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If y'all will do a box or two or twelve and shoost them this way, I'll<br/>
&gt; be happy to plant them and send you the clues to post.. they'll be your<br/>
&gt; plants. Then I'll watch over them and keep them snug and happy and<br/>
&gt; safe. If you can do it, feel free to send them without plastic boxes..<br/>
&gt; I'll be happy to put them in waterproof containers before I hide them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Grand Valley has lots of interesting things just begging to be<br/>
&gt; carved into a stamp. I'm also putting out a call on the main list for<br/>
&gt; Lord of the Rings boxes to be planted on Grand Mesa. But they don't<br/>
&gt; get the dollar. Because, come on, you're my favorites!<br/>
