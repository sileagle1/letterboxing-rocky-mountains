Aljan----dang! I was really looking forward to seeing you wearing the <br>
wings. I don't know exactly when I can, but I have a strange desire to <br>
get that morbid stamp series. When I do that I'll let you know, even if <br>
we have already exchanged.<br>
<br>
Catamount Carvers----same deal, but I'm psyched that I'll get a chance <br>
to meet one of your gang. And maybe get a hint about your new mystery <br>
box. <br>
<br>
Ramdelt---geez! Solve it and take the plunder before I can even read <br>
it, why don't you. I'm beginning to suspect that *YOU* are a pirate.<br>
<br>
I sure hope it works out for a few more folks to meet up in Larkspur. <br>
The Moab thing was just SO great.....I want to do it again.<br>

 <br>
I expect you all to have a raging good time without me though.  I will ne here working wishing that I was there with you sharing stamps and stories and copious amounts of pie.<br>
 <br>
The morbid series is REALLY cool!  I think.  I can't wait to hear what finders have to say about them.<br>
