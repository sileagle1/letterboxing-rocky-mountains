                    <div class="plaintext-content">As most Rocky Mountain boxers know we have been recently plagued with a malicious vandal here in Boise.  Capperpillar and Team Glub both let me know today of three additional boxes that were hit locally by the vandal in Eagle, Idaho.  Two were mine and one was Capperpillars.  In addition I have discovered one box missing tonight and received reports of 2 others this past week that have also disappeared.  I am not sure if these three additional boxes were victims of the vandal or Muggles  but gone is gone.  I have updated my blog with the most recent evidence (pictures) but have taken steps to protect my boxes for the sake of real and honest letterboxers.  Let's just hope I am not too late as the vandals may have already printed all my clues before I pulled them.  Although I am also moving boxes so I guess I will not know unless I find more that have been vandalized.<br>

If any of the boxers we know and love would like to find our Idaho boxes please e-mail me through Atlas Quest or blackvelvetrav@yahoo.com and I will get you the clues you need.  The names and attributes of the boxes are still listed but the clues are gone.  Although I may check the box before providing the clues just to ensure that it is okay.  At this rate it's hard to know for sure.  I have not pulled the clues for my out of state boxes and will not do so unless this situation crosses state lines.  I have also retired and/or archived any missing or unknown boxes on both sites as I was becoming overwhelmed by the volume of missing boxes.  I may or may not do re-carves depending on how much I loved the boxes and if PZ Kut ever becomes available again.  I really need to conserve what rubber I have left for my new boxes.<br>

I hope everyone has had a better Letterboxing weekend than we have had here in Idaho.  I will post this on the Atlas Quest Idaho Board too.<br>

Hoping to keep our remaining boxes safe from Muggles and vandals!  Blackvelvetrav<br>
