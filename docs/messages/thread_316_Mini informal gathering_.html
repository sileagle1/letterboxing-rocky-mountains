  Someone from NY is making a postal letterbox that will come to all 50<br>
  states... I was lucky enough to grab it for colorado.  I am very unsure<br>
  when it will arrive - sometime in the next year! =]  But, when I get<br>
  notice that it's on its way - I will announce it here and maybe we can<br>
  meet up.  The catch is this - I have to have the box back in the mail<br>
  within 1 week of its arrival.  So, it will be a very last minute<br>
  thing... and I will have to do it close to home.<br>
