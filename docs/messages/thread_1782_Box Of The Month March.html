Denver is hosting the box of the month this year. Every month a new box arrives from a different carver and is planted in the same spot. At the end of the month, the old box moves to a different state and a new box is planted. This month we are hosting a carve by The Three Blind Mice.<br/>
I also as an added benefit place an in between box in the spot so that while we are waiting for the next box to arrive, there is still something there to find.  :)<br/>
