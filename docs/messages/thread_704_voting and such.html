that one that "won".  So, now I voted.  I do like pie.   <br>
<br>
My purse that was stolen was not at Waterton Canyon - I have heard that <br>
is a bad place for break-ins.  Yes, Peach, we better always put our <br>
wallet in our backpack.  Mine was stolen at Castle Rock in the little <br>
parking lot under the big Rock.  Seems like a nice quiet neighborhood <br>
but the police said they were having some of this go on in that area.  <br>
There is a good chance these guys will be caught--we think we saw them <br>
coming down the hike as we were going up....and described <br>
them.                  Puppypaws, ready to go again.<br>

By the way, Puppypaws, I found your Morning Glory HH. But I'm not <br>
tellin' where it is now. It's a secret.<br>
