Speaking of Bluff and Pirates...... the true-life mystery of a real <br/>
outlaw was solved last week when a cowboy found the bones of Jason <br/>
McVean. McVean and two others armed themselves with assualt rifles, <br/>
stole a water truck and killed a Cortez, Colorado sheriff in 1998. The <br/>
two others were found dead days later.<br/>
<br/>
Although he escaped into the desert nine years ago, it looks like <br/>
McVean had been dead for a while. I'm pretty sure he didn't have <br/>
anything to do with my missing letterbox.<br/>

scum to walk the earth), for his actions against one of the men in <br/>
blue!  Over a water tank, no less!  He wanted water....well, looks <br/>
like Davy Jones will be takin' care of him at the bottom of the deep <br/>
DRY sea and he be walkin' the desert ever more searching for the <br/>
elusive thirst quencher!!!  Scalliwag!!!<br/>

Hugs, Dreadly...sorry to hear that yet another box is gone missing!  <br/>
Sorry, Y!!!<br/>
