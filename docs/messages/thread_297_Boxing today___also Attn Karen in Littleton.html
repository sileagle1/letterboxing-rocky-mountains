  I went boxing in Littleton today and found the New Alchemists Lizard...I like this location much better...the old area is very overgrown.<br>
  ATTN KAREN FROM LITTLETON-you were there yesterday 8/14.<br>
  I found a pair of sunglasses within feet of the box. Please let me know if they are yours-I am in Highlands Ranch.<br>
<br>
  Also found Woody the Beaver and Fido.  Cute stamps and close to home.<br>
<br>
  Did you all see the 2nd box in Castlewood Canyon State Park Placed Aug 10?   It looks like it was placed by the State Park System...the clues are obtained directly from the Visitor center....<br>
