for us.  Any idea about what you are thinking in terms of a date?  The<br>
Grand Lake event is likely going to be the weekend of Aug. 19th-20th and<br>
the Catamount Carvers will need to be in  Washington state for a family<br>
event by the end of August.  We are contemplating making that a road<br>
trip, which will take us through your territory.  Even so, that doesn't<br>
mean we wouldn't consider coming up for a gathering in mid-summer.  I<br>
suspect that lodging is pretty scarce then.<br>
