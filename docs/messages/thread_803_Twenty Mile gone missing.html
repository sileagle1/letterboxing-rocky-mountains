true.  <br>
Even though it's right in the middle of everything, I really felt <br>
like it was well hidden...you had to start lifting out those rocks <br>
right next to the foundation to find it and there really isn't a <br>
reason to move those rocks around.  So.. who knows?  I'm only sad <br>
about losing the journal.. just like Buffalo Bill, all the history.  <br>
It's my own fault for not just taking it when I saw it almost full, <br>
though.  I'll be grabbing them out when they have two stamps in them <br>
from now on!  hehehehe  That's the way the letterbox crumbles!  Arrr.<br>

Thanks for all the nice thoughts!  <br>

It seems like we've all been there lately.  What is going on?  LBers <br>
who can't "rehide better than found" or non-LBers who can't leave well <br>
enough alone?<br>

<br>
WOM boxes?  When I was in college, there was a group on campus called <br>
WOW, for "Women Oriented Women."  In response, my buddies and I called <br>
ourselves WOM for, you guessed it, "Women Oriented Men."  I have a <br>
feeling that this isn't the same WOM, though...<br>
