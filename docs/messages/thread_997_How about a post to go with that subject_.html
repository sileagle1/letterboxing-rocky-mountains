<br/>
I think you're going to find yourself on some road trips to find <br/>
boxes. :)  Western Colorado is fairly sparce in terms of plants, but <br/>
they are some scattered around.  Fortunately, it's always a beautiful <br/>
drive to get anywhere and Skeetch and I have spent many wonderful <br/>
weekends on the road seeing new places and things in our pursuit of <br/>
the elusive tupperware.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course..you can always plant!  <br/>
<br/>
Es, who will spring away to find new western slope boxes<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to our wonderful little world, where we don't count how many <br/>
boxes we've found, but rather how many miles traveled to get that <br/>
box!! (just kidding) Come to Moab, UT for a weekend, there are well <br/>
over 50 boxes in the area, planted by many talented boxers, the <br/>
weather was in the mid-50's with bluebird skies today!!!<br/>
<br/>
Y, where ARE todays clues (anxiously thrumping fingers on the <br/>
keyboard in anticipation)?<br/>

I have always wondered about those letterboxes around Vail. I know that <br/>
Silver Eagle placed one last summer. And there is another that appeared <br/>
fairly recently by Zuzu. But those boxes placed by Mike have been <br/>
around for quite a while. Has anybody found those recently?<br/>
<br/>
Those trails will probably need to thaw before you can get to them <br/>
anyway. So I second the notion- Grand Junction and Moab while we wait <br/>
for warmer weather.<br/>

Oh man, I was supposed to be counting my mileage as well as finds Kat? <br/>
snort   That road trip out to Oregon is helping my mileage.....<br/>
<br/>
I'd also add that that the weather on the Front Range is like no winter <br/>
I've ever spent in Colorado.  It's been almost Tshirt weather for <br/>
months! and there are also lots of boxes over this way.<br/>
<br/>
...as the mountains get pounded, we go boxing every weekend.  Though <br/>
some of us are starting to run outta boxes over this way, and can't <br/>
wait for summer road trips!<br/>

  Since you brought it up, the Catamount Carvers and I have been talking about working together and planning one here in Grand Lake for late August...  hope I'm not letting the cat out of the bag.  I have to talk to a partner at work to see which weekend might be music festival free so that I have a better chance of taking a day off and then we'll announce officially.  I would love to open up our place for a nice BBQ and stop in for all of you.  We don't have extra beds in the house, we do have plenty of space though and the yard is prime for camping!<br/>
<br/>
  So, unofficially planting the seed,  Aljan<br/>

  I'm still casting my vote for Grand Lake.  So many great boxes, thanks <br/>
to the lovely and talented Aljan Sundance!  Plus, the scenery is <br/>
oustanding and we didn't get all of the boxes when we were up there, <br/>
so we're itching to go back anyway.<br/>

know a.s.a.p. what weekend you're considering because we are in the <br/>
beginning stages of planning our Casino fundraising party to benefit <br/>
Juvenile Diabetes.  My youngest son (now 24) is diabetic and we've had <br/>
many fundraisers, but, this will be our 3rd Casino party, "Ryan's <br/>
Kicker 3"!  They are lots of fun and for a good cause!  Anyway, we <br/>
always hold it the end of August before the Walk to Cure Diabetes in <br/>
Sept.  So, let me know when you know so we are able to make the <br/>
gathering!<br/>

    Bummer!  There is another Archivers out by Aurora mall too.  I forgot about that place...  I'm only about two years and two vacations behind scrapbooking!<br/>
