Hmmm, Es, I think I have a lovely red pair of snowshoes that will <br>
fit nice and cozy over a pair of slippers! <g> We got some new snow <br>
this morning, and I think tomorrow I also am going to go snowshoeing <br>
for an hour or two. I was thinking of making a winter snowshoeing <br>
box and hiding it while I'm out there, that would give me a reason <br>
to stop and catch my breath! LOL!<br>
<br>
I once left just a paper with our stamps on it in a box so the <br>
planter would know we were there. Of course, it was Esmerelda's Big <br>
Fish and I had to let her know that the journal was stolen (big <br>
bummer), so then we had the pleasure of visiting that box again when <br>
everything was replaced, and it was as much fun the second time!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We took our snowshoes to Rocky Mountain Nat. Park and went through on the <br>
Estes side, but there was just not much snow and the day was extremely <br>
windy, so had to settle for a  little hiking and all was OK.  You know you <br>
just can't have a bad day there.........we got some great pictures of <br>
coyotes, sheep and elk.   And, to make the day really good - we found two <br>
out of three letterboxes in the area.  Winter letterboxing is sure a <br>
challenge - we could not find one because of the ice and snow and maybe our <br>
inability to find it.   I loved finding the Shining and had been wanting to <br>
do it for a long time.  Great spot!!!   And, I was thinking it might be a <br>
good idea to leave a note if you cannot find a box - bad idea.  Maybe a <br>
flower would be Ok, just not paper.  We don't need any more trash lying <br>
around.  Puppyface aka puppypaws<br>
