The other older box at Roxborough belongs to Jay Drew, I believe, and <br>
he is a member of this list. You'd have to ask him about what to do <br>
about it. But, personally, I would hate to lose that piece of <br>
history. Especially if it would be possible to move it a little ways <br>
and keep it. All of those boxes up there are on my wish list. <br>
Including the one on top of the mountain. I just don't know when I'll <br>
be able to get up there and look for them.<br>

Thanks very much! We used to be able to get to Colorado during the <br>
summers for some fun and beauty but lately we've missed our trips. <br>
Love it there! I searched back but must have missed where this thread <br>
started: do we need to apply for a permit for our letterbox at the <br>
Overlook?<br>
<br>
We are always worried about developing social trails in sensitive <br>
areas and always try to retire or relocate our boxes before damage <br>
occurs. This box is in a very high traffic area, though. It's a spot <br>
where social trails wandering off to nice places to sit abound. <br>
Still, if there is any kind of unacceptable trail developing (or even <br>
if the box being there gives the impression of damage) we would like <br>
to remove it.<br>
<br>
Now about that Onion...<br>
