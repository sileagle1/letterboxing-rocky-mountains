is uncovered)... We checked King today and put in a new logbook.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">rats!  I already have these.  This nice weather the last week has melted <br>
most snow and maybe we should all get out and hunt.  I tried to hike up <br>
Carpenter's Peak at Roxborough and it was very muddy and icy, so only went <br>
up about half way.  I enjoyed watching a small herd of deer though.  I have <br>
a box at the top and was wondering if anyone found it yet.  probably not.<br>
