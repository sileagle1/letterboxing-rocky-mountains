well, I've seen several, but I saw this one in Yellowstone while I was<br/>
making a loop trip through ID, WY, and a bit of MT looking for letterboxes.<br/>
I took a roommate and her friend along.  It was the first time for them to<br/>
go to Yellowstone and it was the maiden letterboxing voyage for the friend.<br/>
To make the trip even more cool, it was a bull moose.  I love it when I see<br/>
moose in the wild.  The first one I ever encountered was when I was a girls'<br/>
camp counselor in UT.  I was taking my girls for a hike and we ran into a<br/>
mother moose and it's calf.  So cool!!  The only challenge was keeping a<br/>
group of thirteen year-olds away from her so they didn't get charged.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess I don't need to account more adventures in the wild.  I'm<br/>
happy to see you joining us Aryn.  This list is fun.  It isn't nearly as<br/>
busy as the main list and has a decidedly nicer tone, although I still love<br/>
reading both.  Don't worry about not being up against the Rockies.  There<br/>
are some here on the list that don't really live at all near the Rockies,<br/>
but they have planted boxes in them and keep up with questions through the<br/>
list.  Even though I live closer to to what most would consider the Rockies<br/>
(although I guess the Sawtooths would probably still fit in that range), I<br/>
think you've still planted more boxes than many of us here.  We're glad to<br/>
have you!<br/>

Nope!  I have never seen one either and I have lived in CO my whole life!!  But, then again, I have never really ventured out into the wild.  Hopefully I will get my butt out there soon, when most of the snow has melted!!  <br/>

     Geez- Am I the only one on this list that hasn't seen a moose?<br/>

  &gt; I can't believe you remembered that Aryn!  Yes, I saw a moose this <br/>
  fall,<br/>
  &gt; well, I've seen several, but I saw this one in Yellowstone while I <br/>
  was<br/>
  &gt; making a loop trip through ID, WY, and a bit of MT looking for <br/>
  letterboxes.<br/>
  &gt; I took a roommate and her friend along.  It was the first time for <br/>
  them to<br/>
  &gt; go to Yellowstone and it was the maiden letterboxing voyage for the <br/>
  friend.<br/>
  &gt; To make the trip even more cool, it was a bull moose.  I love it <br/>
  when I see<br/>
  &gt; moose in the wild.  The first one I ever encountered was when I was <br/>
  a girls'<br/>
  &gt; camp counselor in UT.  I was taking my girls for a hike and we ran <br/>
  into a<br/>
  &gt; mother moose and it's calf.  So cool!!  The only challenge was <br/>
  keeping a<br/>
  &gt; group of thirteen year-olds away from her so they didn't get <br/>
  charged.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Well, I guess I don't need to account more adventures in the wild.  <br/>
  I'm<br/>
  &gt; happy to see you joining us Aryn.  This list is fun.  It isn't <br/>
  nearly as<br/>
  &gt; busy as the main list and has a decidedly nicer tone, although I <br/>
  still love<br/>
  &gt; reading both.  Don't worry about not being up against the Rockies.  <br/>
  There<br/>
  &gt; are some here on the list that don't really live at all near the <br/>
  Rockies,<br/>
  &gt; but they have planted boxes in them and keep up with questions <br/>
  through the<br/>
  &gt; list.  Even though I live closer to to what most would consider the <br/>
  Rockies<br/>
  &gt; (although I guess the Sawtooths would probably still fit in that <br/>
  range), I<br/>
  &gt; think you've still planted more boxes than many of us here.  We're <br/>
  glad to<br/>
  &gt; have you!<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Till later,<br/>

  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; So does it count that my gym is named Rocky Mountain Fitness and as <br/>
  a<br/>
  &gt; result, I can read the messages on this board???  =-)<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I'm not the smartest when it comes to computers and am not on them<br/>
  &gt; that often so the more I letterbox, the more I learn there are LBing<br/>
  &gt; message boards for all over.  It's makes it hard for me to keep up.<br/>
  &gt; =-)<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Anyhow I love the picture of the moose.  Cadenza saw one once while<br/>
  &gt; she was out letterboxing either in Idaho/Wyoming this past year...so<br/>
  &gt; cool.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Thanks for the invite to this board Autumn.<br/>
  &gt; If you're ever in Idaho let us know so we can link up.<br/>
