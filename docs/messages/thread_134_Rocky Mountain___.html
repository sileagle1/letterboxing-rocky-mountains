                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can't believe you remembered that Aryn!  Yes, I saw a moose this fall,<br>
well, I've seen several, but I saw this one in Yellowstone while I was<br>
making a loop trip through ID, WY, and a bit of MT looking for letterboxes.<br>
I took a roommate and her friend along.  It was the first time for them to<br>
go to Yellowstone and it was the maiden letterboxing voyage for the friend.<br>
To make the trip even more cool, it was a bull moose.  I love it when I see<br>
moose in the wild.  The first one I ever encountered was when I was a girls'<br>
camp counselor in UT.  I was taking my girls for a hike and we ran into a<br>
mother moose and it's calf.  So cool!!  The only challenge was keeping a<br>
group of thirteen year-olds away from her so they didn't get charged.<br>
<br>
Well, I guess I don't need to account more adventures in the wild.  I'm<br>
happy to see you joining us Aryn.  This list is fun.  It isn't nearly as<br>
busy as the main list and has a decidedly nicer tone, although I still love<br>
reading both.  Don't worry about not being up against the Rockies.  There<br>
are some here on the list that don't really live at all near the Rockies,<br>
but they have planted boxes in them and keep up with questions through the<br>
list.  Even though I live closer to to what most would consider the Rockies<br>
(although I guess the Sawtooths would probably still fit in that range), I<br>
think you've still planted more boxes than many of us here.  We're glad to<br>
have you!<br>

Till later,<br>
