                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am hosting a mini meet for Wanda and Pete as they travel through Boise on their way back to Rhode Island.  It has been over six years since they were in our neck of the woods.  Don't let their skimpy numbers on Atlas Quest fool you.  Wanda and Pete have found THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS of boxes since 1999/2000.  It is not uncommon for them to find several thousand in a single year.  If there is a trail story to tell I guarantee you that they have quite a few.  Wanda and Pete are obviously avid hikers who love the outdoors and letterboxing.  Please join me in visiting with Wanda and Pete while they are in town.<br/>
