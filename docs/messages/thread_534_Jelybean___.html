I have a hitchiker in my possession that came to me through the "for Thomas" postal box!  I have an email off to the owner but haven't heard back from her.  Maybe I will try her again and ask her if it can go on with you. ?  The only problem I see with it is that it is accompanied by a really REALLY full log that needs to be replaced.  What do you think?  I would love to carve up a little one to go along.  I will start picking my brain...  An America theme perhaps?  Thanks for sending the Goddess stamp.  I have seen it around and love the original!  Keep me posted about the hitcher thing and I will do the same about the little one that I have.  It has some really really fine sig stamps in it!<br/>
