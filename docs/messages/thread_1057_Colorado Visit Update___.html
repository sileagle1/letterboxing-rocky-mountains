family and I are visiting from Idaho this week.  And are heading back <br>
to Idaho tomorrow.  <br>
<br>
Even though I am traveling with half a carload of non-boxers we did <br>
make an attempt on my birthday to get out and box a little.  We had <br>
really bad luck attempting to locate Buffalo Bill as the weather up <br>
on the hill changed so drastically on our way up that by the time we <br>
reached the parking lot the winds were at least 40 MPH and it was <br>
snowing.  Down below it was beautiful and sunny not even 10 minutes <br>
before the sever weather set in.  After only 5 minutes out of the car <br>
my non-boxing husband gave me the "you must be joking" look and I <br>
must confess my ears were already hurting and we had to leave Buffalo <br>
Bill up on the hill without a find in my book.  As a conciliation he <br>
was willing to stop by the Coor's box at the park on the way back to <br>
my sisters house.  The winds were still awful but at least I found <br>
one box on our trip.  <br>
<br>
Our luck during our Colorado visit turned even darker on Wednesday.  <br>
Lizman (my son Alex) and I were able to plant 4 new boxes in Summit <br>
County called "March of the Penguins."   I am on a computer tonight <br>
that is dial up but if I can manage to not go crazy with the slow <br>
pace I hope to get the new boxes posted.  If not tonight I should <br>
have them up and ready to be found on Monday after returning to <br>
Boise.  The turn to the dark side came later that afternoon.  We went <br>
dog sledding while our non-boxing counterparts went up to Keystone to <br>
ski for the day.  We had originally skied at Copper Mountain on <br>
Monday and Tuesday.  Anyway we received a call on our cell phone <br>
after finishing up with the dogs and low and behold my husband had a <br>
bad fall in the Terrain Park at Keystone and was taken to the <br>
hospital.  He now has 8 broken ribs and his left collarbone is broken <br>
in three places.  He just spent the last two nights at the New Saint <br>
Anthony's Summit Medical Center.  You can imagine the 12-hour car <br>
ride home will not be a comfortable one for him.<br>
<br>
Just an update from us Idaho bound folks.  Colorado is definitely <br>
wild and wolly country!   <br>
