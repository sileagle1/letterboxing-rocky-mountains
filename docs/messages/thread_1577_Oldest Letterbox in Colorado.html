                    <div class="plaintext-content">At the recent Mt. Doom gathering - someone asked me which box was the first<br>
one planted in our fair state. I had an old archive of the LBNA site before<br>
the change-over in 2004. Sadly, when I clicked on that link, the site has<br>
gone away. Boo! The dates in the LBNA basement for most of those old boxes<br>
is incorrect.<br>
<br>
mapsurfer's "The Bard's Tale" was planted in August 2000.<br>
<br>
A trip to The Drew Clan's website showed a half dozen boxes in Colorado in<br>
the summer of 2000, and didn't list planting dates.  So, I emailed Jay Drew<br>
to ask and I got the reply below.  An awesome bit of trivia - our very first<br>
RMLetterboxing "event" was held at the location of one of Jay's boxes -<br>
Fountain Valley - in Roxborough Park which was pulled by park rangers in the<br>
ensuing years.<br>

Autumn,<br>
How nice to hear from you! We miss Colorado so very much, and were hoping to<br>
visit Carbondale for my brother's wedding over Labor Day but it isn't meant<br>
to be. Our first letterbox there was our Loveland Letterbox on the Lewanee<br>
Trail, placed July 13, 2000. Another early box was placed that same summer<br>
by our old friend The Jolly G-Man also in Roxoborough State Park. Wow, what<br>
an amazing place!<br>
It's great to hear from you again, Jay & Margaret<br>
------------------------------------<br>
<br>
So, I'll be checking with Jolly G-Man to see if one might have been planted<br>
earlier.  He has long since left letterboxing, so I'm not certain I will<br>
find his contact information.  In the meantime, we can unofficially call the<br>
Loveland Letterbox the oldest.  :)  And if anyone has any old archives they<br>
can check, that would be spiff!<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Autumn<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's my take on this:<br>
<br>
In 2004 I was puzzled by the fact that the Andrews Lake letterbox had <br>
a "planted on" date of 7/13/2000 AND Mapsurfer listed the Loveland Pass <br>
letterbox by Jay Drew as being the first letterbox in Colorado planted <br>
on EXACTLY the same day.<br>
<br>
I also knew that Jay Drew had planted a letterbopx down here in Pagosa <br>
Springs called Adoped Country on 7/16/2000, just three days later.  I <br>
knew this date was true because I found the box and it had the "planted <br>
on" date in the logbook. So.....I wrote to Jay Drew in March of 2004 <br>
and asked him about this. Here is his reply:<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Hiya! I was surprised to see Loveland listed as Colorado's first<br>
 letterbox myself. At that time the letterboxing community was trying <br>
to get<br>
 "all 50 by Y2K," but we didn't quite make it. I was psyched to get a<br>
 first. But it was the Fountain Valley box in Roxbury that we placed <br>
first.<br>
 In any case, we just spent a week in Keystone that year, so all the<br>
 boxes we planted were pretty close together time-wise. And, to <br>
complicate<br>
 matters, I'm not very consistent about keeping track of when boxes<br>
 were planted. I guess the logbooks will tell: we were hoping to get <br>
back<br>
 to Colorado this summer but have decided on a California trip instead.<br>
 Maybe next year we can check the logbooks! I'll go through our old<br>
 notebook and see if I happened to record the dates, just in case. <br>
Thanks for<br>
 asking, Jay in CT<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
That guy is my hero!<br>
<br>
Anyway, I posted on this list about that back in 2004. It was post #413.<br>
<br>
My personal view is that the Drewclan placed the first box in Colorado <br>
in Roxbury (with Jolly G-Man?)sometime around 7/12, 2000 Because it's <br>
hard for me to imagine him planting all those up north and traveling <br>
down here to plant Adopted Country by the 16th. <br>
<br>
But that is just my guess. We don't have a logbook to verify this <br>
because Roxbury is missing. <br>
<br>
But I do know that Jay Drew told me that Mapsurfer (and now Mark Pepe) <br>
had the Loveland Pass letterbox listed there incorrectly.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Howdy everyone, long time no post for me, but this topic is of great <br>
interest to me since I, too love to hear about the "old" days.  I did <br>
some searching using the Wayback Internet Machine and came up with <br>
LBNA site as of October, 2000:<br>
<br>
http://web.archive.org/web/20001008074451/http://letterboxing.org/<br>
<br>
It lists all the boxes mentioned here plus a few more.  Based on Jay <br>
Drew's claim that Loveland was placed on 7/13/2000, then it appears <br>
to be a tie between it and Andrews Lake, which was also placed on <br>
that date by Brooks/Devere.  Another interesting fact is that the <br>
Loveland letterbox is actually 2 boxes, so I guess there could be 3 <br>
boxes placed on the same date!  It also looks like the boxes placed <br>
by Jolly G-Man were in 2001, so he is not in contention. <br>
<br>
On my first letterboxing trip to Colorado back in 2003 I had the <br>
privilege of finding many of these boxes, but unfortunately not the <br>
Loveland ones.  In fact, I found almost all boxes that were placed in <br>
Colorado at that time, and added my Grand Lake box as well.  It is <br>
amazing to see how much y'all have grown in 5 years and I need to get <br>
back that way again.<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>
