how the obsession started and how it has since developed.  I must say<br/>
that after receiving a real CHOCOLATE TORTE in the mail last week, my<br/>
allegiance has definitely shifted from pie to torte!  This torte arrived<br/>
from Vienna, Austria thanks to an uncle of mine and after a brief<br/>
consideration of sharing it with some friends, we've actually hoarded it<br/>
here within our own family.<br/>

of that torte ....<br/>

Well, I don't know how it compares to the Viennese version, but if<br/>
anyone wants a recipe for KILLER chocolate torte, just let me know.<br/>
Two of the ingredients are 16 oz (that's a pound to you n me) dark<br/>
chocolate and a teaspoon and a half of flour...sure like that ratio!<br/>
Just made one yesterday for an employee birthday, and there were no<br/>
leftovers.<br/>

By the way, aT, I tried to send you emails a while back only to have them<br/>
come back to me.  It was really wierd.  It was like your account rejected<br/>
me, not like it was full or anything.  I'm pretty sure you didn't mark me as<br/>
a stalker since you had written the day before that. :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, send me the recipe too please!  My fiance loves chocolate and I've<br/>
been looking for a good torte recipe like that.<br/>
