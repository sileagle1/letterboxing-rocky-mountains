   <br>
  I will come out with details, you know, little things like directions to the house and all that schtuff, as the date approaches.  ...I'll work on a list of places to stay soon too.  <br>
   <br>
  Happy boxing everybody!  ...as I look out into the hip deep snow in my yard that keeps me from even getting out to fill the bird feeders!<br>

before we came up last September.  Maybe I can clean it up a little <br>
bit and stick it in the "Files" folder.<br>
<br>
Not that I don't think Aljan's backyard would be outstanding <br>
accomodations, but we really liked the little suite we had (and the <br>
shower that came along with it).  Stupender Man might enjoy a shower <br>
under the hose, but I'm a little more bashful.<br>
