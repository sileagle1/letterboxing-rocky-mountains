La Paloma and I found ONE letterbox in our travels over the break. It <br/>
was Tadpole Country in St. George, Utah. The clue sheet must have been <br/>
from Mission Impossible, because at the trailhead it vanished <br/>
completely. We tore our packs and the car apart for a half hour until <br/>
it re-materialized wedged between the seats. After hiking and stamping <br/>
it was too dark for us to try for the others we had printed clues for. <br/>
But........that letterbox is in the COOLEST place. Thanks CWSunseeker <br/>
for showing us this trail, we will definitely be going back.<br/>

My name is Tom Moklestad and I am Programs Director for the Friends of<br/>
Dinosaur Ridge located 2 miles north of Morrison, CO.  On Saturday August 5<br/>
we are having a 2 part program here at Dinosaur Ridge.  One part will be a<br/>
closing of Alameda Parkway over the ridge so that pedestrians and shuttle<br/>
bus riders can traverse the ridge listening to our expert guides give short<br/>
presentations at several of the many points of interest.  The other part<br/>
will be an outdoor program on orienteering here at the Visitor Center.  A<br/>
group called Colorado Geocaching will man 2 booths - one on GPS/map reading<br/>
and another on the hobby of Geocaching.  That group passed on manning a<br/>
booth on Letterboxing even though geocaching.com has a category of<br/>
letterboxing hybrids.  Since Dinosaur Ridge has at least 4 Letterboxes<br/>
hidden between I-70 and Alameda I am contacting experts in Letterboxing in<br/>
order to find advocates for the hobby who would occupy a booth.  The purpose<br/>
would be to introduce Letterboxing to the general public - mostly families<br/>
with young kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since you hid "King of All He Surveys" as well as many other boxes, I wanted<br/>
to invite you to participate.  If you are not interested or cannot<br/>
participate, then I would be very appreciative if you could steer me towards<br/>
an individual or group that might have an interest.  In any event I have<br/>
enjoyed some of your hides including "Blue Heron" and "Waterbearer."<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Tom Moklestad <br/>
