My husband and I will be meeting friends from Canon City for some<br>
camping in Grand Junction sometime later this summer. I looked at a<br>
few campgrounds in the area: Highline Lake, the 2 Colorado River State<br>
Parks at Fruita and Island Acres, and the Colorado National Monument<br>
high above the city. I looked for, but didn't find the Grand<br>
Junction-Clifton KOA. Do you have an opinion about any of these, or<br>
know of any others we should consider staying at? We don't have RVs;<br>
Al and I have a tent trailer and our friends have a camper on their<br>
pickup.  Also what about letterboxes in the GJ area. Any that we<br>
should not miss?<br>
<br>
Hope you can get to Onion Creek soon. It was such a blast crashing<br>
through the water on those creek crossings. Some day I'd like to do<br>
the entire road to Fisher Towers.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">How funny! My boys and I are headed for Grand Junction tomorrow morning <br>
and we hope to find a KOA-Style campground for tomorrow night. <br>
Originally, we had hoped to camp up on Grand Mesa at one of the many <br>
Forest Service campgrounds. But Esmerelda just tipped me off that the <br>
campgrounds are still covered with snow up there.<br>
<br>
I have camped up at the Colorado National Monumaent campground and I <br>
just loved it. It is a lot like Moab, but less crowded, and the view of <br>
Grand Valley is awesome. We would probably camp there, but we want to <br>
get all of the GJ/Palisade boxes tomorrow evening and get an early <br>
start up to Grand Mesa Saturday for the ones in the snow.(There are two <br>
very new ones there, and two almost a year old).<br>
<br>
I'll have to get back to you on the campgrounds and the newer boxes, <br>
right now I'll recommend Big Fish. And I was lucky enough to see some <br>
wild horses on the way back from Mustang, which was cool. But any of <br>
Esmerelda's letterboxes are a real treat.<br>

The Koa is indeed in Clifton... very near the I-70 exit and right in <br>
between Grand Junction and Palisade, so it's a nice, central location.<br>
<br>
Highline Lake is waaaaaay in the heck out in the boonies at the west <br>
end of the valley.  My experience is that it's mostly used by the <br>
people who head out to the Lake for boating.  I probably would suggest <br>
one of the others before this.<br>
<br>
Island Acres is also right off I-70 and a nice spot.. it isn't all that <br>
central, but it's such an easy place to get to that it's not bad.  It's <br>
near the exit to Grand Mesa and a few miles from Palisade.<br>
<br>
The National Monument is in another corner of the valley, but it really <br>
is beautiful up there.  Like Y said, very much like Moab.  A little <br>
further from everything, but if you're not in a hurry, no worries. <br>
<br>
We're working on getting some more boxes placed soon!<br>

If you need any phone numbers or information or whatever, give me a <br>

that I have that all wrong. :oP  Just can't multi-task like I used to!<br>
<br>
My friend from Canon called this morning and we decided on the CO<br>
National Monument campground. I told her about the views and even<br>
though it doesn't have all the amenities of some of the state parks,<br>
we like the more out-of-town-ness of it.<br>
<br>
I have her interested in letterboxing. I introduced her to geocaching<br>
a couple of years ago because she and her husband like hiking. She is<br>
artistic and a talented scrapbooker, so I think LBing would be perfect<br>
for her. So, if you plant new boxes - WOW - we would have plenty to<br>
do. It was hard, but I didn't look for ANY on my scouting trip because<br>
I wanted to save them all for the joint effort.<br>
<br>
Our trip is tentatively scheduled for late August. I'll probably think<br>
of something else I need to know about the area before then and may<br>
contact you if that's OK. Thanks to both Es and Y for your<br>
information. It's great to have contacts!<br>
