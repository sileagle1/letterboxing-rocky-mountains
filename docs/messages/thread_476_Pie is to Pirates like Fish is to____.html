Can it be true that y-nought is not familiar with those red gummy <br>
strawberry flavored vaguely fish-shaped delights we used to get at <br>
the movies as kids?!<br>
<br>
Of course, I always prefered the wax soda bottles filled with <br>
colored sugar water.  Then again there were those colored sugar dots <br>
that came on a piece of paper and you always got little bits of <br>
paper in your mouth...<br>
