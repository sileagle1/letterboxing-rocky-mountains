Thanks Autumn!  I'm a huge dork and didn't notice you had my name on <br>
there already!  Woulda helped if I had read the whole email or the <br>
list!  <br>
<br>
I don't see an edit or delete option.  Could you delete either <br>
the "Bali" or "BNL BaliGrl" listing?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
Bali<br>

night, but hadn't ever seen one on Yahoo before.<br>

I'm already a member of Bali's Dork/Venti Club (hence the out of order <br>
poll-thingy).  Do we get extra patches for dorks? Hi B!<br>
<br>
So between some actual #s and some idea of how many folks might be <br>
willing to cough up some cash in advance, sure seems like we need <br>
some "stinking patches." Ours will "stink" of pie (or cake for Es this <br>
week), of course ;-)<br>

Thanks Aljan for the lovely design and the time you've put in on it.  Yoque wonders if you should initially sell patches at $3 for any pre-orders and then charge $4 for the remainder to help cover carrying costs.  Just a thought....<br>
