                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think I have lots of photos to add... just need to find the cable <br>
that attaches my new camera to the 'puter.  It's been missing since I <br>
got home from Norway, sot it may be a few days.  I'm still pulling <br>
event boxes, returning the HHH, etc.  <br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who came - it was more fun than I ever imagined it <br>
would be.  Loved the pies, cookies, deviled eggs and salads that folks <br>
brought.  And thanks to Tai Chi and Chai Tea, we had plenty of sodas <br>
and waters to keep everyone boxing.<br>
<br>
As soon as I got home, it started thundering and raining heavily - we <br>
really were lucky with the weather!<br>
<br>
Let's do it again next year!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What FRH said!  Given that this was our first event, I was really <br>
pleased how it turned out:  That there was so much interest in a <br>
gathering, that everyone pitched in and stamped until their fingers <br>
practically fell off, that we had a nice mix of locals, and out-of-<br>
staters, a wide age range, plus those who've been boxing awhile, and <br>
those new to the addiction....I mean hobby!<br>
<br>
Just as I said goodnight to the Catamount Carvers in Golden, it really <br>
started to rain....whew!  Oh, and Silent Wings, good job on getting <br>
that "final blow" shot on the pinata! hehehe<br>
<br>
I'd especially like to thank FRH (who, months ago had the idea for a <br>
meet) and to allemeyn for helping to put this thing together.  Folks <br>
kept coming up to me all day saying what "hard" work we'd done.  Split <br>
between 3 people it wasn't hard at all.  I know I never could have (nor <br>
wanted to) pulled this off on my own!<br>
<br>
Hmmmm a possible annual event.....hmmmmm??  That could be fun!  I <br>
already have ideas for some more fun stuff :-)<br>

Thanks again EVERYONE - We're ALL part of the Community Chest!<br>
