A must-do on a visit to Durango!  Even the drive up is beautiful - I saw and photoed a pair of does on my trip.  Also work in that wonderful Tree box of y's at the beginning of the road up to the overlook.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I really love that Animas loop, too.  Skeetch and I finally got to do <br>
the whole thing last summer on a boxing road trip with a stop at the <br>
cool tree box of Y's on the way up.  What a view from up there!<br>
Thank YOU, Y, for making the whole thing possible!  I love that there <br>
are boxes by so many different boxers up there.  <br>
<br>
Es, looking forward to another visit next summer<br>
