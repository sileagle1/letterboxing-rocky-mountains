Hi All--<br/>
     With fresh snow on the mountains and around my feet I stamped <br/>
into Animas Coyote Letterbox today. It was my 50th find. I love that <br/>
box, really great stamp and fun clues.<br/>
<br/>
     Some time ago on this list I said I would trade all my finds if <br/>
I could stamp into Bard's Tale. I realized today that that just isn't <br/>
true. I have been to some great places, with my kids and alone, to <br/>
find these fifty boxes. And I have acquired some great stamp art in <br/>
my journal in that time (a little over a year).<br/>
<br/>
     I agree with Autumn that it has been an amazing year for this <br/>
list and for Letterboxing in the Rockies. And I would LOVE to go to a <br/>
gathering. But since I doubt that I could make it, I shouldn't have <br/>
any input as far as when and where it should be. But if there is one, <br/>
I will try like crazy to make it work. It would be neat to meet some <br/>
of the folks that have placed these boxes.<br/>
<br/>
     In the meantime, happy trails, and thanks for planting,<br/>
           y-nought<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I also brought a nice doggie back with me from the mountain <br/>
today, this time wearing a garland of flowers, (yawrrroooo), good dog.<br/>
<br/>

Woohoo!!! Congratulations on the F50, Y of the Mountains!   I don't <br/>
think I'm even close to that yet...I may need another road trip or <br/>
two.  Or twelve. <br/>
I'm with Y on the gathering...since I most likely can't make it I <br/>
won't make a suggestion for a spot.  But I'll do my best to get <br/>
there!  <br/>
<br/>
Es, doing a standing ovation for F50<br/>
