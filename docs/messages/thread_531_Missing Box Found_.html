So, in January I had a box disappear at the coast and judging by the <br>
water marks in the area, I figured it was washed out in the storms. <br>
So, I bit the bullit and completely remade the whole box and hid it <br>
farther down the path and higher up. Turns out, it didn't wash out <br>
to sea, but was pulled by a state park ranger, who passed it around <br>
the entire district, because none of them had ever seen  a <br>
letterbox, and they loved it. They loved it and kept passing it <br>
around. The ranger just pulled my second box and actually e-mailed <br>
me about it this time. So now I have two boxes with identical <br>
journals and stamps that I need to pick-up from their office. They <br>
had no idea how to deal with letterboxes in that area, so I filled <br>
them in on how the Colorado parks deal with it. She thought that was <br>
a great idea, and will bring it up to the superintendant. Well, at <br>
least I'll get the 'twins' back!<br>

Woohoo!!  That's great news!  Well, not that they took it and you had <br>
to make another and they took that, too, but that it was found!  And <br>
not even floating in the sea!<br>
Are they going to let you know about permitting or whatever down the <br>
road?<br>
I'm curious how they found them.. they must be really keen eyed when <br>
they're out patrolling or whatever they were doing. <br>

Well, the first box was uncovered when they found it, and they were <br>
concerned because one of the wooden steps it was hidden next too had <br>
been pulled up. Sounds like critters to me, but they thought it <br>
might be an overjealous person looking for the box. They said it was <br>
in the way of water draining right there (yeah, like they have those <br>
huge flooding storms everyday!). The second box they found because <br>
they went to the letterboxing site to check it all out. They sounded <br>
relieved that they could talk to rangers in Colorado and see how <br>
things are done over there, because they have no clue how to <br>
handle "these things". Anyway, the boxes are good ones, and I'll get <br>
them back and turn one into a HH!<br>
