<br>
My family and I are new to letterboxing.  It looks like a lot of fun and my kids are already trying to design stamps for themselves.  We are taking a trip to Durango Co to ride the train this weekend.  Anyone know a good starter box in that area?  Something not too difficult to get to - we may still have to sell dad on this and we don't want to mess up the planned excursions too much or that won't happen.  <br>
<br>
Any other pointers for someone just getting started?<br>
<br>
We would love to hear from anyone with advice or info.<br>
<br>
thanks,<br>
Angie Arbuckle<br>

You might want to try this:<br>
<br>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?<br>
boxnum=9624&boxname=Denver_Rio_Grande<br>
<br>
It's easy to find and is related to your trip.<br>
<br>
If you have a few more monutes the Silly Snake Joke Box is not far from this one.<br>
<br>
Have a great trip, and let us know if you found it.<br>
