I'm soooo bummed you missed it again! Probably not as bummed as you, <br>
who drove all that way, but I feel sooo bad. But, victory will be <br>
sweet when you finally do get that box and there might be a special <br>
private-pirates-only surprise waiting for you. (NO, IT'S NOT PIE!)<br>
<br>
I'm torn about what to do with the Left Hand stamp. It has a raven <br>
flying at the top, but the carving of his eye has broken out, so now <br>
he looks weird or evil or something. Does anyone know how to fix it, <br>
or maybe I should just recarve the whole stamp?<br>
<br>
I think there may be an ancient Anasazi curse on letterboxes in <br>
their ancient canyon, because Es can't find it and I can't keep it <br>
dry. Sooo, when you do go to this canyon, maybe we need to do a <br>
special dance or something to please the ancients. Maybe a pie dance!<br>

     I tried to fix a stamp once with rubber cement. It kind of <br>
worked, but the rubber cement is too flexible so the piece that I <br>
glued in moves around a bit. Maybe Barge Cement or Gorilla Glue would <br>
work better. Good luck, and let us know if you try something and it <br>
works.<br>
<br>
y-nought,....remembering that Chief Niwot put a curse on Boulder <br>
Valley,.....Niwot means Left Hand......ooooweeeeeeooooooooo....<br>

ooOOOooooooOOOoooOOooo!!<br>

I think the curse is on me!  An evil pirate curse trying to keep me <br>
from the dry lands and drive me back to the sea. arrrrrr.<br>
<br>
First time Art Trekker from Tahoe had moved it to share the afternoon <br>
with it.. found the spot but it was empty!  Little did I know it was <br>
a few hundred yards away tucked into a picnic basket. <br>
<br>
Second time it just got too dark to start the hike back into the <br>
canyon.  We decided to be safe grownups and turn around and come back <br>
later.<br>
<br>
Third time, walked right to it!  But, once again, only the lonely <br>
river rocks.  So I can find it.. it just can't find me!! Or something <br>
like that.  har har haaaar. <br>
<br>
Some day.  We didn't have pie but we did have ice cream.  So all was <br>
not lost. hehehe. <br>
<br>
Es, wishing she had some pie right now and she probably wouldn't even <br>
share it with all these pilots in the lounge<br>
