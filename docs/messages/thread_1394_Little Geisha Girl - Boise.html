<br/>
Since the box has seen very little action since being planted <br/>
December 4, 2004 I have pulled the box permanently from it's Boise <br/>
hiding spot and I have re-carved this stamp and I am moving it to New <br/>
York. <br/>
<br/>
Here is the history of the logbook pages that were left behind while <br/>
the box was planted in Boise:<br/>

Now that IS peculiar!  My mind is racing trying to figure out the reason<br/>
for that one - and it only comes up with something not particularly<br/>
good, i.e. someone (a 'boxer?) who needs a stamp and logbook, but not<br/>
the box.  Everyone watch out for a new letterbox with that stamp.<br/>
