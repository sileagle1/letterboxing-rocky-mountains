have to laugh when I think of my 11 year old climbing over the rocks <br/>
saying in his best Smeagle voice, "So much tupperware. So little time."<br/>
<br/>
The stamps and logs were absolutely amazing...astounding in their <br/>
creativity and beauty.  We had a great trip coming and going...found a <br/>
couple mystery boxes and are excited for more to come...<br/>

But then boxing would BE work.  I love my work, but it's still work <br/>
(and often lots of it!). ;-)<br/>
