My son, DSOTM, is getting his eye teeth taken out next month. I guess <br/>
I'll need to get him a mirror. (Although he doesn't really need to <br/>
watch what he eats).<br/>

&gt; Y~ You are too funny!! and you're not helping me with my diet <br/>
woas... <br/>
&gt; Ah well, its not like I was 'really' dieting, just trying to watch <br/>
&gt; what I eat. Did you know that, unless you look in a mirror while you <br/>
&gt; eat, that you can't see the food go into your mouth? ...guess that's <br/>
&gt; what eyeteeth are for.... <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Much love to all!<br/>
