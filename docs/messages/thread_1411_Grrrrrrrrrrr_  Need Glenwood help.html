mistake.  They could have just ignored it and you never would have <br>
known what happened to the stamp.  If they took the time to write, I'm <br>
sure they will mail the stamp back.<br>
<br>
I've had lots of great experiences with boxers and non-boxers this <br>
year.  Some non-boxers found one of my HHs while cleaning a wildlife <br>
preserve and mailed it back to me...  Lionsmane and his friend <br>
unburied a box I thought I would never see again...  Someone admitted <br>
to losing one of my HH stamps and returned the logbook to me so that I <br>
could send it out with a new stamp...  The Catamount Carvers even <br>
braved a rattlesnake den to rescue on of your boxes.  <br>
<br>
I hope someone can help and return the stamp to its box. Or maybe a <br>
fall road trip is in order to nab a few special boxes in the area? <br>
