Pirate King' today.  To say it needed attention is an understatement!!  <br/>
It was like being in the Haunted Mansion, only instead of cool fake <br/>
scary things created by highly paid imagineers, they were all real and <br/>
ooky.  But now the outer box has been replaced with a nice shiny new <br/>
one, the clues have been refilled, everything is polished and wrapped <br/>
and clean and ooky-less and ready for more boxers in search of an <br/>
adventure!<br/>
<br/>
So!  If you would care to take a gander at the clues just drop me a <br/>
note.  Even if you're a lurker. Arrrr.  Pirates will play with anyone <br/>
who has a yearin' forrrrr excitement!<br/>

box in the last couple of weeks and didn't make a peep of complaint!<br/>

That box was SO cool and fun - from the clue to the<br/>
stamp and props - that I doubt anyone cared!!  <br/>
