My husband and I will be in southern Utah from September 3-12 to tour<br>
as many of the parks down there as possible:) Does anyone have any<br>
recommendations on (cheap) places to stay, especially over on the SE<br>
side now (found a decent place for the first few nights over on the SW<br>
side)? I'm not having much luck finding places on-line, at least not<br>
places with rooms available. We plan to spend the first few days doing<br>
Zion and Bryce, and then will head over to the eastern side. Camping<br>
isn't an option since there is no way we can bring camping gear. <br>
<br>
And if anyone has recommendations of "must do" or "don't bother, not<br>
worth it" things, please let me know. In addition to Zion and Bryce,<br>
we hope to see Monument Valley, Canyonlands, and a couple other parks<br>
over in that area. And maybe a brief detour to Colorado to see Mesa Verde.<br>
<br>
And if there are any good boxes in those areas....  My husband hates<br>
to box, but he might have to suffer through a few.<br>

Last time we went over to Zion we stayed in a motel in Hurricane. That <br>
town is in between St. George and Zion and we liked it because there <br>
were restaurants and frozen yogurt places to enjoy in St. George, but <br>
we weren't too far away from Zion either. I think we stayed in a Motel <br>
6 or something cheap like that.<br>
<br>
The only letterbox we found over there was Tadpole Country outside of <br>
St. George. That was great fun.<br>
<br>
Around Moab you just take your pick.....TONS of great letterboxes.<br>
<br>
Have fun....it sounds like a GREAT trip!<br>

At least part three of the NAF festival series - Springdale (box one is<br>
missing)<br>
There are several in St. George - Kachina in particular is very nice. You<br>
could spend a day doing that area.<br>
Utah Shakespearean Festival - Cedar City is a must do.<br>
Parawan Gap has Petroglyphs (and a box)<br>
There are more, these are ones I found on my recent excursion.<br>
<br>
There are several very nice ones in Wyoming if you are going that one.<br>
One is several (ok many) miles from anywhere north of Green River.<br>

Yeah, Moab can get a little crowded. Monticello has some hotels but I <br>
am always surprised at the price. I have stayed at the Kopkopelli Inn <br>
in Bluff for pretty cheap. If you go there make sure and eat at Twin <br>
Rocks (Mmmm.... fry bread!)<br>

<br>
I agree with Y on staying in Hurricane. It's half way between nowhere and St. George, easy <br>
to get too, and less expensive than places right by the parks. Kanab also is a fun tiny town <br>
to visit or stay in, near Zion. It also has Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, my daughter's <br>
favorite place in the world. If you have to make  a choice, I would spend a lot more time in <br>
Zion than Bryce, but that's just me!<br>
<br>
When you come towards Moab, you probably won't have a lot of choices on where to stay, <br>
and might want to book something soooon, if anything is left! The Moab Music Festival <br>
runs from Aug. 28 thru Sept. 13 and everything gets booked solid during that time. It's <br>
nice to stay right in town, because you can walk around town in the evenings when it it <br>
cooler. Most of the less expensive motels in Moab are fairly comparable, so I would just go <br>
on one of the Moab lodging websites and check out prices and availability.<br>
<br>
There are tons of letterboxes around Moab, Arches, and Canyonlands, and a couple on the <br>
way to Mesa Verde, but not much towards Monument Valley.<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>
