changing the meeting place for the 10 am get-together to:<br/>
<br/>
The Smiling Moose Deli<br/>
727 Colorado Blvd (on the west side between E 7th Ave and E 8th Ave)<br/>
They have a small lot for parking.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to their web site http://www.smilingmoosedeli.com/<br/>
<br/>
Since we are meeting at a business, please plan on making a small <br/>
purchase.  I had breakfast there three weeks ago and it was delicious.<br/>
