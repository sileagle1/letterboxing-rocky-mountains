Do any of you guys ever sharpen the tips of your carving tools?  And <br/>
if so, how?<br/>

Coincidentally, a friend from CA just sent me a set of carving tools <br/>
and different nibs, and I was wondering that same question! I'm so <br/>
excited to try them out, I'm drawing out a design this afternoon. <br/>
Should be much easier than my exacto knife! But what do you do when <br/>
they get dull? <br/>

LOL.. I bought new ones, too!  But they aren't always really sharp, <br/>
even when they're new.  I used a new one on two stamps today and it <br/>
was better than the old one, but it sure wasn't like cutting butter. <br/>
More like cutting.. well... thick rubber. <g><br/>
<br/>
I'm going to experiment with the sharpening in a couple weeks when I <br/>
have some more time off.  I'll let you know how it goes. <br/>
<br/>
Es, thinking a laser cutting device would be nice<br/>

I sharpen mine sometimes using a very fine whetstone.  It doesn't <br/>
replace getting new ones every now and then, but it helps.  The <br/>
problem is that the sharness of the ones straight from the stores <br/>
isn't always consistent.  <br/>
<br/>
My real pet peave though is that I can't seem to find nibs that have <br/>
good cuts (coming from the store).  Does anyone know what I mean?  It <br/>
seems like the edge of all the ones in the store isn't straight, but <br/>
has either an uneven bend or part of the nib that sticks out <br/>
different than the rest.  I love my carving tools.  They are much <br/>
better than just the x-acto, but I wish there were some better <br/>
quality standards.  The other brands I find online are way to <br/>
expensive to make it worth switching.  <br/>
