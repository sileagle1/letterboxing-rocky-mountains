                    <div class="plaintext-content">JelyBean.. I'm so sorry about that box!  What a frustrating email <br/>
that must have been to get!  Is there any chance you can trace it <br/>
through a company email address? <br/>
<br/>
 My first thought was to wonder if the box had been poorly rehidden <br/>
by the last letterboxer.  In my own opinion, that's one of the <br/>
biggest problems with some of the new boxers who don't want to play <br/>
by the rules.  And, unfortunately, it only takes one.  One of <br/>
the 'newbies' left my Durango Rio Grande box uncovered (and it's <br/>
right in the middle of town!!) and also left Y-nought's Campus in <br/>
the Sky a mess.  I'm so lucky that Y checked my box for me and found <br/>
it before someone else did. All my clues say very clearly to rehide <br/>
the box carefully. I know that pretty much all of us put that in our <br/>
clues.  After replacing the Big Fish journal and rehiding it in a <br/>
different location I went to check on it recently only to find that <br/>
the latest finders had let their 6 year old have the thrill of <br/>
rehiding it.. and it was laying uncovered again. <br/>
<br/>
  And then to have someone just TAKE your box. What in the world are <br/>
they going to DO with it?!  Unbelievable.  This is someone seriously <br/>
in need of a life. <br/>
<br/>
  Y ... it must have been just shocking to find Three Keys <br/>
vandalized. Now that I've found it it just blows me away that they <br/>
even stumbled upon it!  I'm so glad that you remade it for us all to <br/>
enjoy.  <br/>
<br/>
  I've decided to leave my journals the way they are for now. But I <br/>
may pull some of the clues and make them word of mouth. And, at <br/>
least at this point, I will probably make all my future boxes much <br/>
more difficult to get to and/or find.  I'm not going to let a few <br/>
jerks ruin the pleasure I get from this hobby!  When my daughter and <br/>
I go to Disneyland we always make a pact.... no-one no-where, no-<br/>
how, no-way will have the power to ruin our trip. We always say it <br/>
out loud, shake hands then stick to it.  And it always works.  We're <br/>
able to have a fabulous time despite anything anyone might toss in <br/>
our way! HA!  So, I'm going to have to adopt that attitude for this <br/>
hobby that I'm so addicted to!  <br/>
