Colorado letterboxers, your stamps and boxes are wonderful!! Wish I <br/>
could go to your Grand Lake gathering but I'm teaching a letterbox <br/>
workshop that day here in Santa Fe! Anyway- we went to the following <br/>
boxes-<br/>
Strong Face<br/>
French Ingots<br/>
Pagosa Hot Spring<br/>
Lynx<br/>
Animas Overlook<br/>
Olga Little<br/>
Jack-in-the-Green<br/>
Fafnir<br/>
Animas River<br/>
Celtic Tree<br/>
Wings of Eagles<br/>
Box Canyon Park<br/>
Denver Rio Grande<br/>
Fall and Falls in Telluride<br/>
Feline Triskele<br/>
To Hell You Ride!<br/>
Only box that seemed missing was To Hell You Ride!<br/>
Only box that needed some TLC was Animas Overlook- scroll in <br/>
microbox was pretty full and film can had a little hole in the <br/>
bottom. However, someone had placed it in a baggie and this seemed <br/>
to keep it dry.<br/>
Hope to make it back to Durango for more boxing in the spring!<br/>

What a list! A lot of my favorite letterboxes are on that list. <br/>
<br/>
I hope you had a good time up here. And I also hope to get down into <br/>
New Mexico to find some of yours.<br/>
