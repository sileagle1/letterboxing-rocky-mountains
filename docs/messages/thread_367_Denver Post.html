I just had a first finder at my Master's Vision box say hello. She <br>
said that she heard about Letterboxing from a Denver Post article <br>
that was recently printed.<br>
<br>
Did anyone see the article?<br>

section about two or three weeks ago.  I actually tried to find it <br>
on the Denver Post website, but couldn't.  Maybe someone else will <br>
have better luck.<br>
It was timely, too, because we were taking my mother-in-law out to <br>
look for her first boxes that day and she was able to show my father-<br>
in-law the article rather than trying to explain what we were going <br>
to do.<br>
