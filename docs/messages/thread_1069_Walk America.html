<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know it has been forever since I have posted. or even been out to search<br/>
for an LB.  Life with 3 kids keeps me too busy!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, our family has decided to do Walk America (March of Dimes) in Denver<br/>
on April 29.  The walk this year is in downtown Denver and is 6.2 miles.<br/>
(we are even taking the 3 and 5 year old!!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am HOPING that while on this walk, I can find some places to hide boxes<br/>
that I have sitting at home that need to be planted.  So, since I will be<br/>
combining a charity event with LBing that day, I was hoping I might be able<br/>
to count on a few LBers to donate for our walking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
