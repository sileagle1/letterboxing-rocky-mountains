&gt; Skeetch and I are both really bummed out about it.  We both <br/>
remember <br/>
&gt; the fun we had that day when we found it several years ago.  It was <br/>
&gt; such a fun boxing trip with great memories.  It's always so hard to <br/>
&gt; know the log books are gone, isn't it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

Thanks for all the kind words. I have a lot of great memories from <br/>
that box, too, of when I would check and find your stamps in there.<br/>

&gt; &gt; My condolences to you on what was one of my FAVORITE finds. I'm <br/>
so <br/>
&gt; sad <br/>
&gt; &gt; this box is gone and other boxers won't have the excitement we <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; &gt; walking around campus looking for the next spot (we had unraveled <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; anagram wrong and were totally the wrong way mentally, LOL!). I <br/>
&gt; &gt; understand retiring it, however, since it was so exposed and hard <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; be <br/>
&gt; &gt; sneaky with all those students around. Way fun to find though! <br/>
Hats <br/>
&gt; off <br/>
&gt; &gt; to a great box with lots of pizazz!<br/>
