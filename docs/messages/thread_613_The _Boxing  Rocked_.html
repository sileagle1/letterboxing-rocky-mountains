I'm at work this morning after driving back from the gathering last <br>
night and people are asking me why I'm still doing my little happy <br>
dance. <br>
<br>
The Box on the Rocks was even more fun than I imagined. The weather <br>
wasn't a factor for the gathering itself, a little breezy but very <br>
nice. There were a few rain and wind storms that challenged the box <br>
hunters on the trails. But I think everyone found a few. Some of the <br>
more...uh.....passionate letterboxers found more than a few and I <br>
would be interested in hearing some F numbers from some of them. <br>
There are even rumors that tupperware got left behind and new clues <br>
might begin to appear. (Woot!)<br>
<br>
There was a lot of pie eating and saluting to Es and TDG and a lot of <br>
other folks on this list too. We need to do this more often. Really. <br>
And allow more opportunity for everyone to meet up. For myself, I <br>
have some GREAT stamps in my logbook, some GREAT memories of time <br>
spent with some really fun people, and a real boost to my excitement <br>
level about letterboxing. I saw some logbooks that were absolutely <br>
amazing. Both because of how many stamps were in them, and how they <br>
were filled in with notes and pictures and pockets (suhweet!). I'm <br>
feeling a little faint just thinking about them. <br>
<br>
I hope everybody makes it back home safely through the crazy weather <br>
and long drives. And I want to thank everybody for coming so far to <br>
be part of this.<br>
<br>
And a HUGE thanks to Kat for the Event Box, the other boxes in the <br>
Park, the delicious pies, and for her letterboxing energy which <br>
really makes Moab such an awesome place to meet and find letterboxes.<br>

Hello from a snowy Denver!<br>
<br>
Wow - we missed all the weather! Drove home monday to sunny skies and <br>
LOTS of snow on the ground!<br>
<br>
Thank you again to Kat and Y for setting everything up and enticing <br>
us to drive the distance! Your event stamps were spectacular! Moab <br>
was absolutely gorgeous (even with the challenging boxing weather!) <br>
and we will have to come back real soon to get the boxes that we <br>
missed.<br>
<br>
It was amazingly wonderful to meet everyone! The boxers from this <br>
region are so sweet and friendly. We are really looking forward to <br>
the next one!<br>
<br>
~RavenWolf~ and Co!<br>
