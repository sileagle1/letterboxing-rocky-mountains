Because of Mad Hatter Tea Party lunch preparations and other fun treats we do need an accurate count for the event.  <br/>
<br/>
Event Registration:  <br/>
<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=2561<br/>
<br/>
Event Update:  <br/>
<br/>
I'm late. I'm late. For a very important date. No time to say "Hello, Goodbye". I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.<br/>
<br/>
Be sure that you're not late for the Down the Hole registration check-in between 9:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. The White Rabbit would hate to hop off without you receiving your event registration packet including your clue sheet, mad hatter tea party lunch invitation, lunch location directions and an opportunity to warm up your letterboxing skills with the event stamp and a few of the mad hatters misplaced tea party items. There is no way to make it Down the Rabbit Hole safely without being on time. <br/>
<br/>
Down the Rabbit Hole Registration:<br/>
<br/>
Caf Crane<br/>
3130 E. State Street, Suite 105<br/>
Eagle, Idaho<br/>
9:30 a.m. -- 10:30 a.m.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to start your adventure with something warm and sweet Caf Crane offers wonderful coffee concoctions and a pastry chef that was formerly an owner of Mrs. Powell's. The White Rabbit can personally vouch for the deliciousness of both beverages and pastries at Caf Crane. Although any purchases will come out of your coin purse for morning treats the Mad Hatter will be busy preparing a wonderful and wacky tea party lunch for you at an undisclosed location Down the Rabbit Hole. You do not need to contribute any food and there is no cost for lunch or raffle drawing items. <br/>
<br/>
Don't be late for this very important date...once the clock strikes 10:30 a.m. the White Rabbit will disappear Down the Rabbit Hole.<br/>
<br/>
Special Note: The Down the Rabbit hole event will have you inside and outside during your adventures. Weather in October can be wildly unpredictable. Dressing in layers is recommended and it never hurts to have an umbrella handy too.<br/>
