                    <div class="plaintext-content">My journals are from a local bookshop here in Moab. They are like sketchbooks, blank <br>
inside but made of a nice textured paper, the perfect size so that I can paste photos and <br>
ff's along with the stamp, and they open up totally flat for easy stamping. On one side I <br>
stamp a couple of boxes, and the other side I make notes about the boxes or a cool photo <br>
of the spots. They come with different colored covers that have etchings of petroglyphs <br>
and I love them because they are all the same size. I am on my third journal. I bought <br>
several in case they stop carrying them at that shop. <br>
<br>
My first journal was a pain because it had a leather cover that wouldn't open all the way, <br>
so it was hard to stamp into. It has a lot of my favorite boxes in it however, and is small <br>
enough I just keep it tucked into my backpack with my other boxing stuff. My daughter <br>
loves to look at all those old stamps and look at the pictures while trying to remember the <br>
spots we went to when she was so little. I couldn't stand the thought of cutting apart that <br>
first journal because it just has a lot of really cool stuff in there. I cut and pasted little <br>
pockets for trinkets found with ff's and so it is a lot of fun to look in it. I say find a journal <br>
in a size you really like and get a couple of them, keep the first journal the way it is, kinda <br>
like an old friend to visit!<br>

from Ross, believe it or not.  It is hardcover, unlined with suede <br>

seen journals that I like at Michael's & Hobby Lobby with the <br>
sketchbooks.  I also think a search of Tuesday Morning could be <br>
fruitful.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents...<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If you go to either Meininger, or Guiry's, or other specialty art <br>
supply shops, they usually have a decent array of journals that have <br>
neat covers, good blank pages for stamping in, and are spiral bound <br>
so they lie flat for stamping.<br>
<br>
When we run out, we just go get another one, marking the dates on the <br>
inside cover.<br>
<br>
As for the journal you have now, is it that you don't like the cover <br>
and how the pages are kept in it and you want to have it redone? Or <br>
you want to try and move all the stamps that you have into one single <br>
journal? I hand-bind books, and can give you several ideas for <br>
creating your own if you are so inclined. =3 It's easier than it <br>
sounds, I swear!<br>
