We will be attending an all church camp for the weekend.  A priority of mine while in the area will be to check on the status of my existing boxes as it has been quite some time since I visited them.  If anyone might be in the area during the weekend and is up for en exchange please let me know and we can exchange cell numbers via e-mail.<br>
