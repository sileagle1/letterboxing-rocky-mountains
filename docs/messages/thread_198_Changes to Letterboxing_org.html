suggestions to "revamp" the letterboxing.org site, so<br/>
now is your chance to tell them all the things you<br/>
always wanted.  I already sent a note saying I first<br/>
wanted the current site fixed (e.g. Louisiana and<br/>
International boxes not showing up, counties in wrong<br/>
regions, etc.) before adding new things, so maybe somebody<br/>
from this group should send fixes to be made to your area <br/>
(even though you have probably already done this before).<br/>
Also, if you are not happy with the current way Regions<br/>
are set up, reach a consensus among yourselves and send<br/>
your new Regions.  We are discussing this now on the<br/>
Texas Talklist since our Regions could be laid out better.<br/>
Of course, no guarantee any of this will be done, but it<br/>
doesn't hurt to ask.<br/>
