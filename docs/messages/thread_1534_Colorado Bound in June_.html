                    <div class="plaintext-content">Lizman and I will be in Colorado June 18th through June 29th to <br>
attend a youth mission trip with our church.  It's a neat weeklong <br>
opportunity for the youth called Week of Hope and is based doing <br>
community service projects in Denver.  It will include assisting at <br>
food banks and soup kitchens, helping the elderly etc.  We are flying <br>
to Denver ahead of the youth group by a few days (my sister, a non-<br>
boxer, lives in Golden) and then hooking up with them on Sunday the <br>
22nd through the morning of the 27th in Denver.  Then we will head <br>
back to my sisters in Golden before leaving Sunday morning.<br>
<br>
We were wondering if any of the Colorado boxers might have time to <br>
get together for an exchange while we are in Golden some time between <br>
the 18th-22nd?  I was also hoping to hit a few local boxes that do <br>
not involve super long hikes (since our time is sort of limited).  <br>
The last time we were in the area we only found the Coors Beer Box.  <br>
<br>
Let us know if anyone might be able to hook up while we are in town.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd love to meet up with you for exchanges in Golden when you're in <br>
the Denver area!<br>
<br>
Does Saturday, June 21st work - maybe in the afternoon?   How about <br>
you local-area 'boxers (aka "the usual suspects"? Does that date <br>
work?  If so, I'm happy to take it from there to organize.<br>
<br>
What we've done in the past for summer meet ups is to gather at the <br>
park where the Coors box is and take it from there, weather <br>
permitting, do exchanges at a table there, or head out for a cafe or <br>
restaurant if it's not so nice.  Then perhaps do some boxing with all <br>
or part of the group.<br>
<br>
As for fairly easy boxes in the Golden/Morrison area:<br>
<br>
With limited time, you probably won't be able to do them all, but you <br>
could try some of the Lariat Loop series that FRH (Front Range Hiker) <br>
and I put together - especially if you proceed in a clockwise <br>
direction from the first box (for less hiking/driving.)<br>
<br>
Here are some other ideas for the area:<br>
<br>
Of course, you gotta get Bill Cody by Es<br>
<br>
Drivebys or indoor boxes:<br>
<br>
Got An Eye on You (altchar) This one offers an indoor alternative for <br>
a meeting spot if the group prefers.<br>
Gold Miner (The Carving Clan)<br>
Triceratops (FRH)<br>
Town of Morrison (Dixie Peach)<br>
The Fort (me)<br>
I'm quite fond of my own Dream House box..<br>
<br>
Those are just a few ideas off the top of my head.<br>
<br>
It wasn't clear whether you'll be doing any boxing in Denver itself.  <br>
If so, I'd be happy to recommend some.  Most (not all) are my boxes, <br>
but in any case - most Denver boxes are also pretty easy <br>
snags....though some have some clue solving first.  Let me know and <br>
I'd be happy to point ya in the right direction for some Mile High <br>
City exploring.<br>
<br>
Let me know what everyone thinks about my suggestion for a meet time <br>
and place(s) and I'll take it from there by putting something up on <br>
AQ.  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Saturday afternoon would be great.  I mentioned to my sister that I <br>
would be bringing my LB things along and that I was hoping to meet up <br>
with some LB friends. Little does she realize that I would probably <br>
spend my whole time there running all over trying to find boxes if I <br>
could.  I will have to pretend that it is just a casual hobby of mine <br>
vs. the true addiction that it is.  HA! HA!<br>
<br>
As long as the weather looks good I think the park, lunch and boxing <br>
is perfect.  We did attempt for another box while we were there last <br>
time and the weather up on the mountain shifted so quickly that we <br>
were forced to come down off the hill  it was intense.  Needless to <br>
say we didn't nab the box.  Thanks for the box ideas and <br>
suggestions.  A plan of attack really helps when your time is <br>
limited.  I will print out your suggestions and get my clues ready <br>
before we step foot on the plane.  I don't think I will be fortunate <br>
enough to actually box in Denver but you never know.  Once I figure <br>
out where we are staying with the youth group and if there is any <br>
free time at all you can be sure I would hit the trail in an instant.<br>
<br>
Thanks for rolling out the welcome mat.  I am really excited about <br>
coming and the change to squeeze in some boxing, exchanges and visits!<br>
