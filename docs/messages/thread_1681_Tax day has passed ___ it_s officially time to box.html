Mountain area over the next few weeks!<br/>
<br/>
The first is Rocky Mountain Plant-A-Box month, which only halfway through<br/>
April is already (in my not so humble opinion) a huge success!  Boxes are<br/>
popping up all over the place!  Whoop!  You can participate by simply<br/>
planting a box, releasing a hitchhiker, or just reactivating an old box.<br/>
Sign up and get your boxes counted in the final tally here:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=1129<br/>
<br/>
And if that weren't enough already ... I'm excited to say that three<br/>
gatherings will be happening in conjunction with RMPAB Month:<br/>
<br/>
The Rocky Mountain Smilin' Moose Mini-meet is THIS SATURDAY, 4/18 at 10am<br/>
for the Denver area Colorado folks (and some from further away!).  If you're<br/>
coming into Denver for the Doors Open Denver activities, please join us!<br/>
Front Range Hiker thought of the venue, and I'm rounding up the troops.<br/>
Event details are here:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=1208<br/>
<br/>
Local carving mistress Ravenwolf is conducting a logbook making workshop<br/>
(space very limited and may already be full) in Centennial on Saturday, 4/25<br/>
at 1pm, hosted by the lovely Tai Chi and Chai Tea.  Event details are here:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=1210<br/>
<br/>
And the folks on the other side of the hill are celebrating the conclusion<br/>
of RMPAB Month with the Rocky Mountain Gardner Villiage Mini-meet on<br/>
Saturday, May 2 at 11:30am in West Jordan, UT.  Thank you CW Sunseeker for<br/>
coordinating! Event details are here:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=1222<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for getting excited and involved with this little idea of<br/>
mine.  :)   I'll post a final tally of how many boxes were released by those<br/>
who signed up for RMPAB sometime in early May.<br/>
