Hi, All<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to both the hobby and the group, so I thought I'd do a little <br/>
intro. Name's Michelle and I live in Ft Collins. Surprise, <br/>
surprise...that article over the weekend lit a fire under my fanny ;)<br/>
<br/>
I'd read some about LBing but hadn't pursued it. Then along came the <br/>
article and my cousin was really fired up about it. So...off we went <br/>
and yesterday found all of wilderwomn's LB's and had a great time <br/>
doing it.<br/>
<br/>
We got so fired up in fact that we went and planted one just an hour <br/>
or so ago. Here's a chance for an "FF" in your siggy if you don't <br/>
have one already. I posted the clue on letterboxing.org and also on <br/>
atlasquest, and will include them here as well.<br/>
<br/>
Really looking forward to learning lots and chatting with y'all!<br/>
<br/>
Michelle<br/>
<br/>
Clue (assuming you start in Ft Collins, of course)<br/>
<br/>
Find and follow the street of equine dentition to its western <br/>
terminus. You'll need to park the car here. Proceed west on the <br/>
footpath. When it forks, stay to the left and cross the footbridge. <br/>
Make a left turn. Just past the sign of signs, you'll find a fallen <br/>
tree. One piece lies apart. Beneath it, you'll find your goal<br/>
<br/>
Should be pretty easy to find. I'd be really happy if anyone who does <br/>
drops me an email and lets me know what you think.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Welcome, Micheele!<br/>
<br/>
I've reposted my three Fort Collins boxes, so there are a few more <br/>
for you to find.<br/>
<br/>
Isn't it addicting?!<br/>

Hi, Jodie<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the welcome! The article was on the front page of Sunday's <br/>
Coloradoan...the Xplore section. It's stirred up some controversy, I <br/>
see...but ever the optimist, I'm hoping only good things come of it. <br/>
Sure was good for me!<br/>

It's just waaaay cool, Es! (she said grinning and waving right back)<br/>
<br/>
I just finished making new personal stamps for Cuz and myself...can't <br/>
wait to get out and use 'em. Also made a couple for new boxes we have <br/>
planned...should have them ready in a day or two. Hope you can come <br/>
on over this side before too long and check these out. Probably <br/>
pretty elementary, but what the heck...gotta start somewhere, <br/>
right? ;)<br/>
