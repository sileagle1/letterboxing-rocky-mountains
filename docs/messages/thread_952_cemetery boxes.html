<br>
Having recently placed a box in a Pioneer Cemetery TTDIDWYD:Riverside <br>
#1, (Denver) and found one Niwot, CO....most cemetaries actually rest <br>
on private property.<br>
<br>
..these are my comments, for what they may be worth.<br>
<br>
I also subscribe to the Ask Forgiveness, not Permission Skool of <br>
Lbing....<br>
<br>
However, in the case of final resing places: <br>
<br>
Try all you can to Place on non-private land )or just over the fence) <br>
if you possibly can!  Cemetaries are private land! they have <br>
landscapers who will, when weather is appropriate....notice you've <br>
been around<br>
<br>
Place with care, and place often!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been 'boxing all over the US and have found many cemetary <br>
letterboxes (and planted a few myself).  I have seen both those <br>
within the actual cemetary and those placed outside, nearby, or in <br>
the surrounding fence or wall.  My general observations:<br>
- most boxes are NOT placed within the cemetary, however, most also <br>
require you to ENTER the cemetary to look for a headstone or other <br>
landmark<br>
- the object within the cemetary is often used in the clues (eg, a <br>
date might be compass heading, or you may have to line up some <br>
statues to get a bearing, etc. - I had one where you had to look <br>
through a hole in the headstone to sight the box location)<br>
- boxes placed WITHIN the cemetary are more likely to go missing<br>
- whether within or without, cemetary boxes are cool<br>
(ok, that last one was an opinion, not an observation, but you get <br>
the idea)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have planted a cemetery box that I just loved.  It was outside of this<br>
wonderful old ghost town cemetery in my Land of the Yankee Fork series.  The<br>
whole series is one of my favorites.  I have heard a lot of debate about<br>
appropriateness, so I think sensitivity is good.  I hid mine just outside of<br>
the fence, even though it is not still an active cemetery (it also made it<br>
easier to find a non-public hiding spot.)<br>
<br>
I also found one box in Texas last summer.  It was in a more modern<br>
cemetery, but the box was hidden near a special memorial fountain and not by<br>
individuals' graves.  I thought this was still tasteful and okay.<br>
