                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!  I just joined this list today.  We (AndPlus2) are Texas boxers and are members of that yahoo list.  We are traveling to Colorado this summer (July) on vacation for about 12 or 13 days (including driving days).  We will be spending time in the Gunnison area, but we want to do a little traveling around.  We know we'd like to ride the train between Durango and Silverton, but there are so many other options and we want to choose wisely.  We have two children, so we need family friendly things.  We welcome any suggestions you have to offer to us regarding activities, must-see attractions, and boxing in Colorado.  We are looking forward to finding some Colorado boxes to add to our logbooks!<br>
