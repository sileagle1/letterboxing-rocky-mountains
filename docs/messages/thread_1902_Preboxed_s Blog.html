                    <html><body><p>Since we visited the Denver area last week, we’ve become intrigued with solving more of preboxed’s clues. What an incredible variety she had! We have discovered that she had a blog, called Pre in a Box, that appears to have clues embedded in it. It looks as though you need an invitation to get to the clues. </p><p>Is there anyone on this board who is the guardian of Pre’s blog? Or knows how to contact the right person?</p><p>Many thanks for your help,</p><p>Mira from girlguides</p></body></html>
