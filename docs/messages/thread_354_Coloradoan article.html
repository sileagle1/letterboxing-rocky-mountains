I understand not wanting people to take our boxes, but what if there is<br>
somebody out there just waiting for this?  What if there is another great<br>
LB'er (we all know who they are here.) just looking for an outlet for<br>
their creative energy?<br>
<br>
I live in Fort Collins and would be happy to speak to the writer. But<br>
maybe you wouldn't want me to. I would like some feed back on how to<br>
participate in letterboxing without being selfish.  Do we be more<br>
selective in who gets access to clues?  Do we have some boxes "open to the<br>
public" and others that are "private?"  I have only been letterboxing for<br>
a short while but I can't imagine a better hobby.  It is family friendly,<br>
low cost, gets you out and about to see things you never would have<br>
before,  you meet great people, it is creative/artistic.  WOW! Who<br>
wouldn't want to do this?<br>
<br>
I've also seen incredible boxes stolen for no reason what so ever.  There<br>
was one near my old home in Calif with ties to Star Wars.  All 4 (I think<br>
there were 4) were stolen.  You don't just happen to stumble upon 4 boxes<br>
planted seperately.  Somebody had to have gone online, found the clues and<br>
taken them.  Just plain mean.<br>
<br>
Yet, how many would be here if we hadn't have found out about it by<br>
reading an article?<br>

That would suck.  I have met so so so many nice, great, fun people through letterboxing so far and hope that it continues.  I think that word of mouth is a great way to pass the hobby on, I heard about it through a friend that thought I would think it was really cool (thanks Amy!) and I have passed it on to a very few people that I thought would like it too.  <br>
 <br>
I can't remember who said it (and it sounded much cooler when they said it) but I loved what someone said about planting boxes.  They were talking about how when they leave it they pretty much give up ownership of it and keep a hope that it will be there for a long time and get lots of visitors.  I try to feel that way when I leave mine.  Besides, people that steal or damage the boxes expose themselves to eternally bad karma and will always be searching for their lost left shoe.  They will get what's coming to them.   <br>

        I think it would be great for you to speak to the writer. <br>
This topic has been worked over pretty well on the big list. My <br>
feeling is that it is better for them to find out from you than third <br>
hand from the Time or CNN pieces. I also think there is some valid <br>
concern that with the first wave of activity after publicity, there <br>
will be some people participating that don't understand the finer <br>
points. When I came upon a box lying exposed next to it's hidey hole <br>
with nothing put back in the bags I realized that there is virtue in <br>
making clues a little harder or the hikes a little longer.<br>
<br>
       It really is personal choice. Some people can accept the fact <br>
that thier letterboxes may dissapear and others want to take measures <br>
to keep them around a little longer. Let everybody suit themselves as <br>
to how to protect their treasures, but by all means do what you can <br>
to get some of the finer points into that article. We can definitely <br>
still use a few energetic newbies.<br>
<br>
    just my dos centavos,<br>

rather than let the reporter flounder out there for info on his own. <br>
That way maybe the message of, "please put everything back exactly <br>
how you found it, and REHIDE the box better than you found it," will <br>
come through to new boxers.<br>
<br>
It is a bit of a conundrum. We want cool new people to join in, <br>
therby bringing new boxes to the state, but it leaves us open to <br>
jerks who may destroy a box just for the sake of destruction. We will <br>
have to trust what we have now dubbed "the Jodi Curse". =3<br>
<br>
Very cool on the JeffCo permit thingy - by the way on Litha and Rain <br>
Cloud. I am waiting for 3 permits to come back *keeping fingers <br>
crossed!*<br>
