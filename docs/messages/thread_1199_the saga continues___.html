new image.  If you have stamped in before, you may want to check out <br>
the clues and find it again.  If you are familiar with the series, <br>
this stamp should mean something to you.<br>
<br>
BUT<br>
<br>
We also learned this weekend that Give Me a Hand is now missing.  We <br>
went and confirmed this yesterday.  It will be a truly amazing day <br>
when all of the H-A's boxes can be listed as "active" at the same <br>
time.  You may want to go and collect all of our stamps while you <br>
still can.<br>
