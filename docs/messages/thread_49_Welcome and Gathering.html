like to remind the group that we have tentatively decided on a date <br>
and location for our Colorado RML gathering!  <br>
<br>
Saturday, August 23rd at Roxborough State Park!<br>
<br>
We need to determine an exact location within the park (Dixie can you <br>
help us with that?) and a time to meet!  We'll be having a:<br>
Potluck picnic<br>
Stamp Exchanges<br>
and there are two boxes (presently) located in the park's trails.<br>
<br>
I am hoping to have a personal traveler completed before then, as <br>
well.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions for times, picnic areas?<br>
