I am forwarding this email in case it entices any of you even more to make<br/>
it out to our gathering in Salt Lake City.  We have had a slight change in<br/>
schedule due to an airline scheduling conflict.  I will send the info in<br/>
case any are able to make it after all.  We would love to have any who can<br/>
make it.  This should be a lot of fun-a chance to meet other letterboxers,<br/>
and a chance to plant/find a slew of new letterboxes.  If you know of any<br/>
others who might be interested, please let us (and them) know.  I know there<br/>
are some letterboxers in Utah that go out boxing, but don't really plant<br/>
boxes or participate on the list.  We'd love to have any and all who can<br/>
make it.  <br/>
<br/>
It looks as if we will be meeting on January 3rd now.  This should be a good<br/>
day to get out and enjoy some letterboxing.  Butterfly and I haven't decided<br/>
on an exact time yet.  We are still feeling things out a bit with her<br/>
family.  If you have strong feelings about what time we should meet, let me<br/>
know.  <br/>
<br/>
As for locations, we were thinking about meeting in Memory Grove (in<br/>
downtown SLC) since there are two letterboxes hidden there already (A Walk<br/>
in the Park Series).  We can meet there and decide where we want to go from<br/>
there.  Some of that will depend on the weather and what we want to plant<br/>
after that.  I imagine that we might stop somewhere for some lunch along the<br/>
way.  That might be more warm than a picnic style thing.  If you don't know<br/>
how to find Memory Grove, I can give you more specific directions or you can<br/>
find them in the clue to the letterbox series.  If the weather gets bad, we<br/>
can skip over to the state capitol or a restauraunt to take shelter.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you can make it.  I will be emailing later as we know more<br/>
about what we are doing.<br/>

Hi U2<br/>
Things are moving along here in Ct and you can not begin to believe how<br/>
excited my letterboxing friends are that they have this opportunity to<br/>
share our joy with others.  I have a shopping bag full of boxes to<br/>
bring. They have nice greetings to you all also.  There are several that<br/>
will be easy to take out of Utah and plant , but most have the Utah<br/>
theme and so will really have to be planted somewhere there.  One is a<br/>
Rocky Mt. Stag , so he can go elsewhere. I have two Event Stamps,  one a<br/>
snowman carved by Leader of the Pack . She also carved a  Sea Gull<br/>
flying from Ct to Utah. ~ Chuck of Chuck and Molly Fame,  carved the<br/>
Rocky Mt Stag and  The Utah State Animal , Our fun loving Needeeps is<br/>
sending two also, one a  Connecticut or Bust , cute, and a Map  Forever<br/>
United  -really nice--  Lobsta lady [our Maine gal.] did a great history<br/>
lesson on Ephraim  and  nice stamp also a H.H. from her a Boomerang  ,<br/>
Ct.&gt;&gt; Ut.&gt;&gt; .  Bluebird designed  The Bridge  connecting Ct. and Ut.<br/>
then our Slo Camel  [a teacher] did a great job on a Bee Hive with a<br/>
lesson about that too.  Steve and Heidi and Maddras [a dog]   carved<br/>
CT. state map with a Butterfly in the middle !! and Music Woman send a<br/>
lovely carving of a Ct. Light House.   So,  those are the boxes and<br/>
there are also some H.H.  Do you think we will be busy ?? And I only<br/>
have one day.  Of course I am going to ask the children to drive me<br/>
around to sight see --with a few boxes in my backpack--just in case. :-D<br/>
Now,, I need to know how I will be able to get in touch with you .  Also<br/>
I will find out the address of the house where I will be staying in<br/>
American Fork.  <br/>
Can't wait.<br/>
Butterfly in CT.<br/>
