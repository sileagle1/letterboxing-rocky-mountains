No luck at all. I found myself looking in all the same places that I <br>
had looked before. As is often the case when the trail runs cold, I <br>
need to step back and see it with a fresh outlook instead of checking <br>
the same ideas over and over......<br>
<br>
It also gets dark and cold pretty fast nowadays...<br>
<br>
Oh well, this isn't the only letterbox clue that has me baffled, there <br>
is also the Russian Cowboy, the Bard's Tale, and of course the heinous <br>
(for me anyway) Stegasaurus.<br>
