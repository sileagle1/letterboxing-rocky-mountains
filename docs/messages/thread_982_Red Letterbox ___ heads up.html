                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was Cirrus' (aka Kapu) 10th birthday today and we thought it would be<br>
fun for him to pick up a "first finder" on a newly planted box not too<br>
far away.  However, when we finally found it, it had actually been placed<br>
on Dec. 21 (not Jan. 9) with the FF getting picked up on Christmas Day. <br>
It's an interesting box and we like the stamp, but Yoque will be<br>
contacting the owner to try and get him to clarify his clues a bit.  Of<br>
all the letterboxes that we've found, we think that this is the creepiest<br>
site and think that it's critical to have good clues for this particular<br>
area.  We personally came across the carcasses of two elk and a deer on<br>
our search for this box and were serenaded all along by gun fire.  If any<br>
of you were planning to head out there, we suggest you hold tight until<br>
the owner works on the clues a bit.  It's not too difficult to get to ...<br>
it's just the type of area that warrants very clear directions.  You<br>
don't want to travel ANY FARTHER than you have to on this road.  And yes,<br>
we read the warning at the bottom of the clues, but it all just wasn't<br>
very clear to us.<br>

planted by my son and his girlfriend and it's their first plant, <br>
first hand carved stamped, first everything!  They actually <br>
surprised me and Cappy wtih it for a Christmas gift knowing how much <br>
we love this hobby.  That is why it was planted on Dec 21st and we <br>
found it on Christmas Day!  He put the date he posted the box rather <br>
than the date he planted it, not realizing the difference.  I spoke <br>
to him about us being the "First Finder" with the obvious advantage <br>
we had!  We want to make it right to Cirrus, and I've emailed you <br>
offlist about it.  <br>
<br>
I don't know where exactly the clues led you astray, we found it <br>
right away, but we did warn him to warn everyone.  The serenade that <br>
Silent Wings refers to is a shooting range that we understand is <br>
down the road and over the hill, but you can hear it clearly. I <br>
haven't read the clues he's posted yet, I will do it today.  Since <br>
it is so close to the road we thought you could park, grab it and <br>
leave without a problem.  I will let him know to clarify the clues <br>
right away and let you all know when he's done that.  I hope it <br>
won't keep people from adding it to their Finds, he worked so hard <br>
on it.  <br>

We're personally looking forward to more boxes by this new planter!  We<br>
