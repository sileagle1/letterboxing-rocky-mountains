                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was Cirrus' (aka Kapu) 10th birthday today and we thought it would be<br/>
fun for him to pick up a "first finder" on a newly planted box not too<br/>
far away.  However, when we finally found it, it had actually been placed<br/>
on Dec. 21 (not Jan. 9) with the FF getting picked up on Christmas Day. <br/>
It's an interesting box and we like the stamp, but Yoque will be<br/>
contacting the owner to try and get him to clarify his clues a bit.  Of<br/>
all the letterboxes that we've found, we think that this is the creepiest<br/>
site and think that it's critical to have good clues for this particular<br/>
area.  We personally came across the carcasses of two elk and a deer on<br/>
our search for this box and were serenaded all along by gun fire.  If any<br/>
of you were planning to head out there, we suggest you hold tight until<br/>
the owner works on the clues a bit.  It's not too difficult to get to ...<br/>
it's just the type of area that warrants very clear directions.  You<br/>
don't want to travel ANY FARTHER than you have to on this road.  And yes,<br/>
we read the warning at the bottom of the clues, but it all just wasn't<br/>
very clear to us.<br/>

I don't know where exactly the clues led you astray, we found it <br/>

it is so close to the road we thought you could park, grab it and <br/>

won't keep people from adding it to their Finds, he worked so hard <br/>
on it.  <br/>
