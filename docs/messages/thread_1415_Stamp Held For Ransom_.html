To be honest, I've been drinking and can't think straight to tell you her user name at this time but I think she lives in the Glenwood/Carbondale area.  She moved there from Oklahoma within the past year.  She placed the large series around the elk loop.  <br>

I wish that I could join all of you for the gathering coming up but have been doing very well playing tennis this year and I am playing in a state championship tournament at the time of the gathering.  Have some pie for me, okay???  Thank you!<br>

Well, I'm pleased to report that I got my own stamp in the mail <br>
today for Hot Spring. Still some serious logistical issues getting <br>
it back in the box and without help, it could easily be next spring <br>
before I can fix this "thing" myself. <br>
<br>
Soooo, if anyone might be able/willing to help me out, until or <br>
unless I can get over the Divide myself, I SURE would love to hear <br>
from you. Feels a bit like holding my own stamp for ransom! Least <br>
I'm feeling a little less .....grrr today...been having "issues" <br>
with quite a few of my boxes lately...<br>
<br>
Ok, how many of you have or are seriously thinking about calling <br>
that Chicago # to say "wtf, dude?" Heck, maybe it's an elaborate <br>
clue thingy....if mean-spirited. I love that Layers series!<br>
<br>
Kat - thanks SO much for checking up on my BMAO box. You're a Rock <br>
Star of the highest caliber! If ever I can return a favor, please <br>
just let me know.<br>
<br>
Boxer Lover: Thanks for sharing that article with us :-)<br>
<br>
Oh, and Y...I'm cough, cough...hack, hack...feeling as giddy as a <br>
school "boy" (if a bit "ill" quite far in advance) - So the "word" <br>
will be when I call into work on Friday before jumping in the car <br>
with FRH to head to Santa Fe. "Mental health" counts for a sicky <br>
day, doesn't it? Yeah, yeah I know...hard to tell with me. But <br>
that's my story and I'm sticking to it 'cause I SO have wanted to <br>
get back to Santa Fe. You've been warned, trebuchets, nuts, and <br>
all....<br>
<br>

(wanders off humming the tune "Do you know the way to San Jose?", <br>
but changes lyric to "Santa Fe.")<br>
