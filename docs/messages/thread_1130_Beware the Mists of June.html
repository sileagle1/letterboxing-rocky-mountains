Hey all you scalawags!  It looks like the Noughts of the Mist will be <br/>
at the Ren Faire on the 21st.  And I heard from a dread pirate that <br/>
Peach and Cappy just may be there that day as well.  If I can get <br/>
someone to pick up my Friday shift, I, also, will be sailing into <br/>
port that fine Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
So.. anyone else?  Anyone?  Rennaipalooza 2006?  <br/>

&gt; Yes.. the 22nd!  I had just noticed that on the calendar and came <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; change it!  Woot!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I believe two people qualify as a gathering.  ::checks Pirate <br/>
&gt; handbook::  Yup.  It says two.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Marmot's Revenge!  LOL<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will indeed be putting that letterbox back... most likely in two <br/>
&gt; weeks when I visit my fine family.  Hopefully I can replace Little <br/>
&gt; Raven at the same time.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I may not be able to wear my fine pirate duds, Peach.  If I have <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; drive over that morning I'll be shoosting straight to the faire <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; no time for a transformation.  Maybe I can wear my hat!! ARRRR!!  <br/>
And <br/>
&gt; a sash!  And a little sparkly thingie with a two level effect....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Es, ready for a peachie hug<br/>

&gt; &gt; a "gathering"???  FRH, be sure to let us know if you find any <br/>
