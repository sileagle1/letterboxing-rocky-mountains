Hey all you scalawags!  It looks like the Noughts of the Mist will be <br>
at the Ren Faire on the 21st.  And I heard from a dread pirate that <br>
Peach and Cappy just may be there that day as well.  If I can get <br>
someone to pick up my Friday shift, I, also, will be sailing into <br>
port that fine Saturday.<br>
<br>
So.. anyone else?  Anyone?  Rennaipalooza 2006?  <br>
<br>
Es, buckling her swash<br>

Hey all you scalawags! It looks like the Noughts of the Mist will be <br>
at the Ren Faire on the 21st. And I heard from a dread pirate that <br>
Peach and Cappy just may be there that day as well. If I can get <br>
someone to pick up my Friday shift, I, also, will be sailing into <br>
port that fine Saturday.<br>
<br>
So.. anyone else? Anyone? Rennaipalooza 2006? <br>

Es, buckling her swash<br>
