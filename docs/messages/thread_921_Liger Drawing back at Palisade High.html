My friend Napolean Dynamite said that his Liger Letterbox is back in <br>

Hey Es, you should meet my niece ... she's got great skills with duct<br>
tape too.  She made a whole prom dress with matching shoes and purse (all<br>
out of duct tape) and wore it to her high school prom ... no kidding.  I<br>
can really appreciate someone with those kind of skills.  It was real<br>
sweet!<br>

Seen that movie? Of course I have! I'm in Idaho, remind you. I've spent some<br>
good time in the very town it was based in. It's about 1.75 hours from here.<br>
In fact, if you go to the chamber of commerce, they actually have a Napoleon<br>
Dynamite tour that you can get maps for. Come to think of it, that may make<br>
an interesting letterbox, hmmmmm . . .<br>

I just got home from a week at the coast and just got the news about <br>
the liger! Suhhweet! Next time I go bowhunting for wolverines, because <br>
guys like girls with skills, I will be dropping off my addition to the <br>
N. Dynamite series while hunting ligers and things.<br>
<br>
Napolean and Pedro were the spokepersons for the Utah State fair a <br>
couple of months ago, and had a whole series of hilarious commercials <br>
advertising the fair.<br>
