I sent a post to the Scotland boxer (Laura) thru another list I am on <br>
telling her that everyone here was thrilled to have a stamp from <br>
Scotland in their boxes.  Im not sure which particular dual box she <br>
is talking about so hopefully the placer is on this list. I am <br>
forwarding her response below.....<br>

Well Lisa, you made my day!!  How fun it was to look through the <br>
journals at all the entries.  We particularly liked the sort of duel <br>
boxes--a micro box followed by a proper box (with journal, etc).  A <br>
theme connected the two, on both occasions, and the cleverness <br>
factor made it all the more enjoyable (not to mention superb <br>
carving).  So if you know who that was, please pass it along (and <br>
keep the day-making going!).  If you are so inclined, could you also <br>
let all of them know that they have helped inspire and keep the <br>
candle burning toward getting a letterboxing scene/site and <br>
hopefully eventually community going here in Scotland.<br>
<br>
We had intended on e-mailing placers, but were so caught up in <br>
catching up with folks and doing the holiday thing, we just didn't <br>
get 'round to it.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for letting me know.  It's so nice to feel a part of <br>
something so positive.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had forwarded the below message to Jodie.  She sent a reply back saying<br>
that the Scotland letterboxer(s) had found her Windy Gap boxes.  They are<br>
over by Granby and are a great set of boxes with excellent carving.  It<br>
could be that they also did the Monarch boxes ... another great set of<br>
boxes, which also gets you out on a beautiful hike.  Jody was unaware of<br>
this list, but that is no longer the case.<br>
