<br/>
In the spring of last year, I came across a little curiosity on eBay.<br/>
It was a little booklet with a red leather cover and the KGB shield on<br/>
it. It looked to be a kind of declassified mission booklet for KGB<br/>
spies or something. I showed it to a few friends last year who thought<br/>
it was interesting. Since I know how much letterboxers like secrets<br/>
and maps and such, I thought it would be fun to share it with a wider<br/>
audience. So I slapped in on the scanner and put the pictures up<br/>
online here: http://home.comcast.net/~the.jefe/letterboxing/mink  I<br/>
hope you get a kick out of it.<br/>
