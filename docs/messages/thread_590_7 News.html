He is looking to go on a hike, talk about what letterboxing is all about, and also touch on the environment and keeping it clean.  We'll see how it goes.  He does understand that we are not going to give too much away and put letterboxing or our plants in jeopardy.<br>

My idea is to take him on a really high, hard hike and then nobody <br>
would want to find that box.  Maybe go to the top of Guanella Pass <br>
while it is snowing.  I have not had much luck convincing rangers we <br>
are environmentally friendly.  Puppypaws (being skeptical)<br>
