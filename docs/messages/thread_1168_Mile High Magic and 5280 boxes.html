I have been so upset about the poor performance that the Rams have had this year that I couldn't think about gloating about the CU victory.  It's kind of like a Division 3 team glaoting over a win versus a Community College flag football team.  The Rams really need a new look in the off-season.  If Sonny wants to keep his reputation, he needs to clean house of some of the coaches.  I hate to say it but Hammerschmidt should be the first to go.  He has gone through a lot in the last year with his wife passing but his performance over the last few years has dropped off considerably.  CSU has the players to be an excellent team but the coaching is holding them back at the moment.  Defensive coordinator Standard is next in line if they can't put something together in these last two games.  We need to take steps forward, not backwards......we leave that t<br>
o CU...HAHAHA!!!<br>

ARRRR....you scurvy Ram!  Welcome back to the CU/CSU smackdown!  It's <br>
good to hear your voice, Ramdelt!  I've missed the rivalry!  Okay, <br>
we'll leave it that BOTH teams need some improvement and leave it <br>
at....We'll get you NEXT year!  At least we can both agree on cheering <br>
on the Broncos!  GADS!  Are they the heartattack team or what???<br>
<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Cappy and I finally got to replacing the box that went missing for a <br>
second time!  We actually decided to put both stamps in one box...the <br>
box that seems to stay put!  Check out the clues!<br>
<br>
So, if you visited these boxes but was unfortunate to find the one <br>
missing, you can now revisit it and find a second stamp waiting for <br>
you!  Hopefully, it will hang around for a while.  <br>

ahead!!!  GO ORANGE AND BLUE!!!<br>
