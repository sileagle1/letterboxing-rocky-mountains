Hi all,<br>
<br>
My clan and I finally got our long lost letterbox retrieved and <br>
posted.  I'd love to upload the clues to the LBNA site but I can't <br>
log in.  So... in lieu of that, I'll post the cluses here.  The <br>
history of this box is kinda funny.  About a year and a half ago I <br>
carve the stamp and intended to plant it somewhere.  The time came <br>
for Mother's day and the clan did indeed plant it.  And promptly <br>
forgot to post any clues.  Now about 1 year later, the box has been <br>
found (it really never was lost), replanted, and the clues written <br>
up.  RavenWolf and the Samuri has been threatening me to get the <br>
clues up.  So, with no further adieu...<br>
<br>
Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me<br>
<br>
Location: Castlewood Canyon State Park, CO  ($5 Day Use Fee)<br>
<br>
Directions To Park: To reach Castlewood Canyon State Park, take I-25<br>
to Castle Rock, turn east on<br>
Highway 86, go six miles to Franktown, turn south on Highway 83 (S. <br>
Parker Rd.)<br>
and go five miles south to the park entrance.<br>
<br>
Short Clues: Main Park Entry. Canyon View Nature Trail.  Paw Prints<br>
Marker.  40 degrees.  25 paces.  Backside of cairn.<br>
<br>
Child and dog friendly with leash.  That's the dog not the kid :)<br>
<br>
Introduction:<br>
<br>
Castlewood Canyon State Park is one of the State's most beautiful <br>
parks.<br>
<br>
Situated in the Black Forest of central Colorado, it is an absolute<br>
geological wonder.<br>
You can see spectacular metamorphic and sedimentary rock formations <br>
in<br>
the canyon, carved by Cherry Creek.<br>
<br>
This is an excellent spot for a picnic, as there are both small <br>
tables<br>
scattered throughout the park, as well as a very large group <br>
facility.<br>
<br>
There is a small playground, and lots of wide concrete trail to walk <br>
on.<br>
<br>
Castlewood is particularly beautiful in the spring, as you get to see<br>
lots and lots of moss, lichen, frogs, lizards, etc.<br>
<br>
In the summer, bring your sunscreen.  The sun reflecting off the <br>
rocks<br>
will cook you!  This is also rattlesnake country.  Don't reach into <br>
any cracks or crevices without proper caution.<br>
<br>
The Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me box was put together by <br>
PhoenixAscending,<br>
and the stamp hand carved by her.  Thanks to her honey & son Connor<br>
for help with planting.<br>
<br>
You can find out more about the park here:<br>
http://parks.state.co.us/default.asp?<br>
action=article&contentID=612&parkID=76<br>
<br>
Pictorial Clues here:<br>
<br>
http://www.phoenixascending.net/cpg/thumbnails.php?album=2<br>
<br>
Please note that there are two separate sides to the park.  You need<br>
to go in the Main Park entry, which is off of Highway 83 (aka Parker<br>
Road).<br>
<br>
Verbose Clues:<br>
<br>
1. Park in the Juniper Rock parking lot.<br>
<br>
2. Go to the entrance of the "Canyon View Nature Trail".<br>
<br>
3. Head along the trail for about 5 minutes.  You will see a number <br>
of<br>
animal-themed trail markers along the way.  You should pass the<br>
pronghorn and lizard markers.  When you get to a marker with a pair <br>
of<br>
small paw prints on it, stop.<br>
<br>
4. To your North should be an open expanse of rock.  Head at 40<br>
degrees (NNE), for 25 paces.  You should be at a natrual cairn of<br>
rock.  Look on the backside of this, in a crevice.  Hopefully, there<br>
will be rocks concealing the box.  Please replace them!<br>
<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

Phoenix: HA! I don't know if we've been threatening exactly. We just <br>
had our own name for it. It was the "Kidnap Phoenix to Get the Clues <br>
Box" That's all. =3 You're not the only one having problems logging in <br>
to the main site apparently.<br>
<br>
HA's: Total bummer about your boxes! Don't give up - we really enjoy <br>
your boxes! We tried to get the Lemony LB when it was missing, and <br>
Little Wolf is DIEING to go back and pick it up. And we were pondering <br>
the clues to the Super Uno Guy. I know general area that it is in, but <br>
we have to wander down there to get specifics. We all feel your pain! <br>
It's really cruddy when a box goes missing, or someone vandalizes it. <br>
But know that us finders really appreciate all the work that you do, <br>
and our hearts go out to you when something like this happens! <br>
(Remember Aljan's curse!)<br>
<br>
Rainy here in Denver too... *sigh* No Lemony LB for us until the <br>
weather gets a little dryer.<br>
