I had an idea for the patch graphic and Elros used his Microsoft Paint <br>
skills to represent it. I uploaded it to the Files section of this <br>
board if you want to have a look.<br>
<br>
This can go with the other ideas to be voted on as folks submit them, <br>
OR, and this would make me really happy,<br>
someone with more artistic skills could use this idea and tweak it into <br>
something better.<br>

 <br>
      ROCKY<br>
   MOUNTAIN<br>
LETTERBOXING<br>
 <br>
And blended Rocky and mountain together making them look like mountains. maybe the ROCKY could be the snow caps. <br>
 <br>
Just a thought. <br>
