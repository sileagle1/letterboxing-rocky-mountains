Many, many moons ago a little pirate Esmerelda and her family moved <br>
into a brand new house in a brand new sub-division called <br>
Northglenn. We lived there for quite a while as the neighborhood <br>
grew up around us.  Great memories.<br>
<br>
Es, just oversharing<br>

That is so kewl! We actually live in the house that I grew up in. I <br>
lived there (here?) untill I was about 8 and then moved. We moved in <br>
4 years ago This Labor day. We are planning to "plant" a box soon. <br>
(Now, we all know the story about the best laid plans of mice and <br>
Men... HA!) <br>
