                    <div class="plaintext-content">As many of you know, back in October, I started a donation PLB to raise<br>
funds for my friend's son to get hippotherapy lessons.  This box has<br>
been VERY successful and has raised $470! (lessons are $115/hr)<br>
 <br>
I am almost at the end of the list for those who have asked to be put on<br>
the list to get this box.  So, now I would like to reopen it for anyone<br>
who would like to sign up.<br>
 <br>
If you want to learn about Thomas and why he needs these lessons, please<br>
visit my website: http://www.geocities.com/dscott5377/thomas.html<br>
 <br>
the requirements for this box are as follows:<br>
 <br>
- I am asking that you donate $5.00.  However, if you are unable to meet<br>
that amount, I understand.  And, of course, if you want to donate more,<br>
that would be very appreciated.  Each 1 hour session at Pegasus costs<br>
$115.00 <br>
- You must be willing to mail this Priority Mail w/ Delivery<br>
Confirmation<br>
- You must email me with the deliver confirmation number when you mail<br>
the box out.<br>
- You will need to email me for the next name on the list - I will not<br>
include a mailing list in the box<br>
- I will be emailing each of you individually as the box gets close to<br>
your name.  If you do not respond, you will NOT get the box.  In this<br>
email, I will also ask you to confirm your mailing address.<br>
- This box MUST be mailed out within 3 days of its arrival at your<br>
house. (I can always change the line up if the box will be coming to you<br>
when you will be on vacation, etc) <br>
 <br>
Thank you so much for signing up for this box.  I am so happy that with<br>
your help I will be able to give Donna and her family this gift for<br>
Thomas.  <br>
