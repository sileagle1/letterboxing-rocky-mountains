Durango in Da Nile, so everthing is ancient Egyptian...if you go to the<br>
snowdaown website the poster has heiroglyphs on it, hmmmm).<br>
<br>
Okay - so I took a stab at the heiroglyphs, and I think I need to dig out<br>
some of my old books on this one.<br>
The whole first column is not particularly helpful.  It shows people doing a<br>
variety of things.<br>
Could be representative of the various activities and events at the<br>
festival.<br>
The second column gets a bit more interesting.  More people/activities,<br>
followed by (at the lower right) some glyphs that could possibly be<br>
translated, if I get my head around it.<br>
There are a series of fronds - with variations.  My first instinct was<br>
bushes, shrubbery, foliage (a garden?).<br>
The next glyph - the one that rather looks like a pacman on a stick - is<br>
Kha, which can also represent 1000.<br>
Below that, we have the sky, the sun, (do those two simply mean outdoors?)<br>
something that could be either a scroll or a deadbolt (hmmm?)<br>
and a duck.<br>
<br>
I'll pull out my books later and see what I can decipher from the poster.  I<br>
am guessing the hieroglyphics are just decoration, but hey - never having<br>
been to Durango - perhaps there IS a garden with a thousand bushes and a<br>
deadbolted duck entombed somewhere.<br>
<br>
I'm just sayin.<br>
