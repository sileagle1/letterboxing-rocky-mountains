Sorry about that!  Ya'll have been keeping us so entertained with <br>
stories of new boxes and tales of ... Pie???<br>
<br>
I had the opportunity to go letterboxing over my birthday.  Was <br>
visiting the Central California coast - Monterey Peninsula - and <br>
found two boxes.  Can I just say that it is so beautiful there?<br>
<br>
Anyway - bitten by the boxing bug again, and am looking forward to a <br>
free weekend to go out and get some of the great local boxes I've <br>
been meaning to find, perhaps a trek to Ft. Collins for a boxing day.<br>
<br>
I've been logging my finds at Atlas Quest - if ya'll haven't been <br>
there yet, it's wicked cool.  There's a link in the links section.  <br>
Anyway - I've missed you all, and hope we can coordinate some sort of <br>
gathering in the late spring/early summer.<br>
<br>
Best,<br>
Autumn<br>

How coincidental!! My boxes that were taken by the ranger were <br>
located in Pacific Grove, on the Monterey Peninsula. I grew up in <br>
Pebble Beach and Carmel, but now happily live in my redrock paradise <br>
away from the ocean and the crowds!!! So, if I get my boxes back, <br>
you'll have to go back and find them in their new locations. There <br>
are some nice boxes out there, which two did you find?<br>

*grins*  I found the "Monterey Letterbox" just across the way from <br>
the pier, and the "Point Pinos Lighthouse" which took forever to find <br>
since we weren't in the right turnout.  Finding that one was a treat, <br>
as many folks noted in the logbook that they'd made two or three <br>
attempts to find it.  It converted my friend to letterboxing forever, <br>
and now he's carving his own stamp!  Whoop!<br>
<br>
We were going to look for a few in PG, but ran out of time.  Sorry <br>
yours were picked up.  That would have been awesome to find some of <br>
your boxes out there.<br>
<br>
You have to admit, Carmel is breathtaking --- spent some time on <br>
Pebble Beach - groves of cypress to die for -- while I love CO, I <br>
could easily move there (if it wasn't so damned spendy).<br>

Those two were fun boxes. I admit, I was one of the people who <br>
couldn't find it the first time. I came back with a garden trowel <br>
and found it buried about a foot deep in hard-packed sand, and oh <br>
the happy satisfaction of finding it finally! LOL!<br>
