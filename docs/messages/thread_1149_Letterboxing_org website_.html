in a long time... but yesterday the letterboxing.org website was not <br>
working right, and today it says the domain has been suspended.  Does <br>
anyone know what's going on with it?<br>
<br>
Also, are there any other sites that list boxes for our area, other <br>
than Atlasquest? thanks!<br>

"The Letterboxing North America site will be offline until we can <br>
move to a new hosting service. Unfortunately, the low cost web <br>
hosting that we've been using can't accept the increasing load that <br>
we're putting on the shared server as letterboxing has grown over the <br>
years. More details on where we'll go next soon."<br>

<br>
Since it looks like it might be awhile, here's some info sources in <br>
the interim:<br>
<br>
Link to LbNA Yahoo talk list for anyone who wants updates and news on <br>
this issue. (I just also added this to the links section on the RM <br>
talk list)<br>

Other than Atlasquest, I'm not aware of any other comprehensive clue <br>
lists.  However, you can view cached clues on Atlasquest for boxes <br>
which have links to LbNA (in addition to clues actually posted on <br>
AQ).  See this discussion for more info:<br>

Hope this helps.  Too bad about the timing...right before the weekend.<br>

It'll take you to the same place, but the full hotlinked URL should <br>
work now: (fingers crossed)<br>
