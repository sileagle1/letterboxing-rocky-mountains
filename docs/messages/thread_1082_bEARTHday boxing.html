                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are just back from a long day of bEARTHday boxing and a few of you <br/>
should have notes from us indicating that we stamped into your boxes.  <br/>
Sadly, we discovered Box#2 of the Big Dry Creek boxes scattered about <br/>
near its hiding place - just the box and the ink pad, no sign of the <br/>
stamp or journal.  Aljan, we'll need more voodoo.  The good news on <br/>
that hike was all the wildlife:  turtles, a snake, a heron, a muskrat, <br/>
a rabbit and many, many prairie dogs.<br/>
<br/>
The funny story of the day:  we found the Bunny hitchhiker in A Road-<br/>
side Incident in Boulder.  Exactly one year ago today, we dropped <br/>
Bunny off in Castle Rock at The Rock.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, a question:  have any of you sought Puzzling Bugs or Fly, Be <br/>
Free! in Boulder?  We had some difficulty, though the clues were <br/>
really straightforward.  Not really looking for hints, but just want <br/>
to make sure they weren't missing or one of the landmarks missing.  <br/>
Contact me off-list if you don't mind me running some questions by you <br/>
to see if we were in the ballpark.  Thanks!<br/>

Heck, at this point I think I need to get a voodo doll to go with <br/>
Aljan's.  I'm gonna take the left foot off mine in advance..'cause <br/>
there won't be any need for a shoe for it for all the box-disappearing-<br/>
muggles-types.  Talk about hopping mad - grrrrr! <br/>
