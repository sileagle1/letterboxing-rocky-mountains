The two boxes at Chatfield (take your bug spray, though).  <br/>
The Peninsula box in Frisco (just did that one myself today).  <br/>
The Grand Lake box<br/>
The WoTY- Yule box<br/>
The Garden of the Gods (Little Feet) box - Colo. Springs<br/>
All three boxes at the Plains Conservation Center in Aurora - though <br/>
Coyote Canter is over a mile (guess it depends on the stamina of your <br/>
kids)<br/>
The boxes in the Bailey area would be easy enough for kids - <br/>
definitely the Dragon's Lair, though the Abert's Squirrel might be <br/>
tricky with a toddler - even with a pack.  Bring another adult with <br/>
you.  <br/>
<br/>
I try to put in my clues if the hike and terrain are kid friendly.  <br/>
When in doubt about a specific box you plan to get, just ask the <br/>
group!<br/>

And welcome to the list, Debbi!<br/>

thank you so much for your input!  I can't wait to get started! =]  Of<br/>
course, now we just have to find the time.  It seems every weekend is<br/>
full with something.  This weekend we have to finish cleaning out the<br/>
basement - remodeling starts on Wednesday.  Not to mention that it is<br/>
soccer season for my 12 year old.<br/>
<br/>
Can you (or anyone) tell me about the 2 boxes in Laramie?  My brother is<br/>
in school up there... so we plan to make a trip in the near future...<br/>
so, if the boxes are in kid-freindly spots, I would like to try and get<br/>
to those while we are up there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
