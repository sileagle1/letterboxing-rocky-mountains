<br>
So in scanning the archives, I see there isn't much of a tradition <br>
of posting trip reports to any extent - for Major Road Trips with a <br>
Boxing Purpose.  I'm a life-long world traveler, and some of the <br>
sites I subscribe to do have this tradition...in exchange, I <br>
suppose, for help/assistance/encouragement given PREvious to a <br>
trip....<br>
<br>
As a newbie here/and a frustrated writer on this talk list, may I be <br>
permitted to try it?<br>
<br>
....when I can't box, I amuse myself.......sewing/thinking about <br>
boxes for next year/etc.<br>
<br>
If it's too much - please say so or just ignore this post.. and I'll <br>
stop!<br>
<br>
In the meantime, for anyone who cares to read on....<br>
<br>
and yep, there IS Pie.....eventually....<br>

Haven't Got a Clue and Frozen Crap.<br>
<br>
My Thanksgiving Road Trip 2005 from Denver to Portland and back in <br>
13 days and 3232 (.9!)miles..and doubling my letterboxing count, by <br>
the way, a first and last time I'll get to say this.. newbie that I <br>
am, but fact's is facts!<br>
<br>
Sorry parental ones..the "Cr*p" word, was the best I could come up <br>
with..just nowand it's quite intentional and indicative. Ya'll <br>
will see why, very soon ..if anyone cares to read on....<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Everyone who really knows me wouldn't believe that I was literally <br>
pulling away from the curb at 6 a.m. that Friday  the first day of <br>
my first "real" vacation in 3 years..   But, those same folks would <br>
know just how much traveling (and significant time off to do so) <br>
means to me and that I CAN do stuff when I want totravel!  <br>
Heck, "only 2 weeks", pre???<br>
<br>
I don't usually get out my passport/driver's license for less that 4 <br>
months.<br>
<br>
The story that must now be told is that I should have known what the <br>
theme would have been for the trip that very first morning.  I <br>
didn't of course, but I sure do now.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Car loaded the night before and having gloated about the trip for <br>
weeks before hand, the morning of trip jitters (oh and the cats) <br>
made sure I was awake, without alarm clock at 5 a.m. and raring to <br>
go!  Shower, coffee for the road, and last minute items (mostly <br>
food) to be packed.  <br>
<br>
Then to the car  arms loaded down. <br>
<br>
Every single door of the little green Subaru was frozen shut, even <br>
the back tailgate which has no glass to rubber seal.  Not just a <br>
little stuck  haha, snort grrr!   Tried kicking the metal part of <br>
the door with a boot to try and break the seal between the glass and <br>
the ice.  Prying the window/rubber seal with car keys?  Nope!  It <br>
hardly ever gets this cold in Denver and there was no snow on the <br>
ground.  But then again, I'm hardly ever up at 6 a.m. so what do I <br>
know?  I do know that several years ago I did finally break down and <br>
buy a hair drier.  I didn't bother to use it that morning, like most <br>
mornings.  Extra time and mornings are not two things usually <br>
associated together in my life.<br>
<br>
It took about 10 minutes of prying to finally get a door, any door <br>
open to get into my car.  My wet hair now frozen solid to my head, I <br>
wondered how many of my neighbors woke up with the sound of <br>
profanity that morning?<br>
<br>
Then on to southern Wyoming.  And a headwind.  All day!  Grrrr.  All <br>
10 hours of it to make it to the Ogden/Brigham city area.  Tried for <br>
several letterboxes to make nice stops along the way.  Struck out <br>
several times  including one I really wanted, but since I'm still <br>
new to boxing, I think my patience for actually finding some when <br>
I'm in the right area still needs some work. My comments re: <br>
attempts at finds reflect ONLY my own frustration/nebieness-dom, and <br>
are NOT in any way directed at the placers of those boxes!<br>
<br>
Der Mad Stamper's Lil Bug's Bungalow at Expedition Island where John <br>
Wesley Powel set off for his Colorado River journey  That location <br>
has been on my list to visit for years and the weather was chilly, <br>
but clear so all was not lost.  A big huge rock was there, placed <br>
since the place date of where this box sure seemed to be,  sat where <br>
the bearings lead me.<br>
<br>
Encounter on the Oregon Trail, Don and Gwen  a 40+ mile round trip <br>
detour for nothing.  I'm kicking myself for not stopping and really <br>
registering the mileage in the clues when I didn't find the concrete <br>
markers.I saw some brown metal road signs up ahead so went for <br>
them.by then, I'd lost the .erm trail..sigh.In this case, so <br>
much sage brush, so little time -  which I didn't have.  "The Oregon <br>
trail, California Trail, Mormon Trail, and the route for the Pony <br>
Express" all meet in one place (like SO many on my trip) and I <br>
missed this box which really wanted.  I never did find out where to <br>
get more info on the "audio tour" mentioned all those signsit <br>
probably would have broken up the bad spots on the radio dialI <br>
asked at several National Parks, etc, en route on what the Audio <br>
Tour was "all about."  Many rangers tried, but could never <br>
satisfactorily answer my Q....<br>
<br>
Home on the Range, Heather  YAY my first actual find for the 1st <br>
day. Yipee!  A nice little local park just off the highway.  Wacky <br>
geese and ducks with funky Mohawk hairdos greeted me when I got out <br>
of the car.  My first inclination that although in our normal <br>
everyday boxing worlds "just off the interstate" boxes aren't of <br>
interest.......on Road Trips.....Not True!<br>
<br>
Imaginary Roadside Attractions: Improbable Parks/lisascenic.  The <br>
description in the clues about how this box came to be was reason <br>
number #1 to seek it out.  giggles!  Been in touch with the placer  <br>
we talked bout significant detours "off route" to find nada, and <br>
how  folks should visit this box more often.come on  you KNOW <br>
you're bored to the point of suicidal at this point in the road!<br>
<br>
The camping spot I'd planned on was right by the interstate.  Ick!  <br>
They did have nice holiday lights set up at the park right by the <br>
Great Salt lake.<br>
<br>
The next morning I realized that I'd been feet away from The Rings <br>
box by A and J Bears.  And I even Had The Clue printed up for this <br>
one on me already to goThis would also become a theme <br>
Grrr. But it Sure Beats Working!<br>
<br>
And that was only Day One<br>
<br>
pre...<br>
<br>
more soon-ish...<br>

I'm enjoying the report.  Keep letting us know where you went and what has<br>

I looked up Golden Spike LB on LBNA and it looks like HER/preboxed DID<br>
find it on 11-19-2005. Yah!<br>
<br>
After CW Sun Seeker and I failed to find it last fall, I contacted Der<br>
Mad Stamper. He related as much as he could remember about seeing the<br>
Big Fill Trail only once 5 years ago and where he thought the box<br>
should be. (To his credit, his memory was right on the money.) A-Bear<br>
provided the map from when she had found the box (she must keep<br>
EVERYTHING!) and guess what? The NPS has re-written the trail's tour<br>
booklet and RE-NUMBERED THE INFO MARKERS!!! The marker referred to in<br>
the clues is now in a completely different place. Indeed, there is NO<br>
marker now within sight of the box location. Now armed with the old<br>
map, CWSS returned to the trail and found the box. She emailed its<br>
location to me and then I found it, too.  I emailed new clues to DMS,<br>
but he has been busy with stuff and hasn't yet updated the clues on<br>
LBNA. He gave me permission to send the new clues to HER since we knew<br>
Golden Spike was on her itinerary. So a group effort and many emails<br>
later, it looks like it was a success! Way to go, HER!<br>

<br>
Found my first box placed by someone else in Central Denver today <br>
(12/22/05) on the way home from work today.(Rocky Mountain Choo <br>
Choo/Treasure Finders  check it out and YAY!)<br>
<br>
Today we were sent home early..to 11 whole paid days off!  Wahoo, <br>
don't mind if I do..<br>
<br>
As promised, here's the next update, particularly at the urging of <br>
Cadenza ;-) Whose stamp I got to see for the first time on this <br>
tripbut that's much later<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Day Two belongs, boxing-wise, completely and utterly to Boxer <br>
Lover..! and my own style of dumb freaking LUCK!  Oh, and Pengy.  <br>
<br>
I attempted to honor Boxer Lover when I did, in fact, log into <br>
Golden Spike.  Without BL's postings on this list, and a few private <br>
emails before my trip I never, ever would have found this box.  I <br>
really, really, wanted this one.    Boxer Lover is My Hero!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Some of you may remember that I posted PREtrip that this box in <br>
Promontory was on my list of "must haves" and definite stopovers.  <br>
This National Park has been on my "to do" list ever since I moved to <br>
Colorado..in 1999, and having recently become addicted to boxing, <br>
well, ya'll know the rest.<br>
<br>
So, I'm also into penguins.  Since this trip was a solo trip, at the <br>
very last minute on that very cold morning when I set off, I decided <br>
to bring Pengy with me.He's an approximately 9" tall stuffed <br>
penguin on the trip, with a homemade stylish fleece neck gatorof <br>
course!.Which is what I've been sewing "to beat the band"in larger <br>
sizes, of course.  Trip now officially paid off.<br>
<br>
The truckers on my tripped noticed him on the dashboard many times. <br>
One of my many philosophies of life..If no one else can/will amuse <br>
you, do it yer own danged self.snort <br>
<br>
Musta been the weather that cold morning.  Penguins can't fly, don't <br>
ya know so Pengy makes me drive him everywhere.  He navigates (and <br>
is crap at ithe wants to go everywhere and doesn't understand the <br>
concept of Time Mangement!)  I also think Pengy might also be <br>
stealing my PREquent flier miles for vacations to warm places like <br>
Hawaii, cause I sure haven't been redeeming them lately<br>
<br>
So on the road from Ogden to Promontory there is a Bird <br>
Sanctuary..I never knew that.Pengy got excited!  We both wished we <br>
could have stopped to explore.  If anyone is interested in placing a <br>
punny penguin to honor a bird from Antarctica.stamp in a bird <br>
sanctuary located in desertlemme knowI'll carve the stamp!<br>
<br>
<br>
I spent the 2nd morning of my trip talking to the Rangers at the <br>
Golden Spike NP, doing some hikes and auto tours.  Tried to find out <br>
information on some of the Audio Tours noted with brown signs I'd <br>
passed many times on the interstate.  The ranger, bless them, bored <br>
in off season, even got on the internet, printed me off a bunch of <br>
stuff for other NPs and Welcome Centers, but could never hook me up <br>
with info on what I wanted.  If anyone on this list knows more, love <br>
to hear from ya.<br>
<br>
I'd highly recommend stopping by the visitor center before going for <br>
the Golden Spike box .   Of course you need to find the NEW TRAIL <br>
marker for this box  the numbers aren't even close to what's up on <br>
Der Mad Stamper's clue sheet, but the interpretation in the guide, <br>
imho, really makes the hike relevant from a historical perspective <br>
even if (gasp!) there weren't even a box in the area.  For those of <br>
you also "bag" NPS Passport Stamps in addition to your boxes, this <br>
is a good one. <br>
<br>
For this next bit, I'm trying hard to walk the fine line between my <br>
story but,  also not giving too much away for boxers, which of <br>
course is very bad form.  <br>
<br>
Found the starting point for the new clues just fine.  I have a <br>
geography degree, so I know my way around a compass, but I tell you <br>
whatthis bearing grrr.So many rocks!  I kept rechecking my <br>
bearing, and looked for at least half an hour for the box.  I <br>
really, really, didn't want to give up on this one.but I'd burned <br>
up a LOT of time this morning, and still had some major driving to <br>
do for the day.  (Boxes in the Boise area had to be baled on as a <br>
result, unfortunately.)<br>
<br>
Ok, "one more time" for this box.  Feeling stupid, blonde and <br>
frustrated, I almost gave up.  Wait!  What's that sound?  That sure <br>
didn't sound "right" where my foot just landed..  OMG!  I stepped <br>
right on TOP of the box!  <br>
<br>
You should have seen me!  I'm not ashamed to admit I did the Disco <br>
Version of Happy Dances on that trail!  There was screaming and <br>
shouting with joy involved, as well &#61514;<br>
<br>
Boxer Lover, I Owe Ya  Big Time for this most rewarding find!  Just <br>
let me know when it's Pay Back Time!  <br>
<br>
I emailed DMS when I returned home with a status update.  I sort of <br>
hoped the clues would be updated by the time I posted this part of <br>
my trip report (a few days over a month since I left on the trip), <br>
but see they haven't been updated yet.  All can say, boxers, is as <br>
of 11/19/2005 the box IS THERE and in a place very unlikely to go <br>
anywhere anytime soon.  If you want to contact me off list, I'll do <br>
what I can to helpSince I haven't asked for permission as of this <br>
writing, perhaps I should shoot DMS another email and ask if it's OK <br>
if I, like My Hero, I can give out updated clues.<br>
<br>
I spent 4-5 hours in the Park and didn't leave for boring interstate <br>
driving until about 2 pm.  Major Driving to do toward BoiseThat <br>
didn't stop me from boxing.<br>
<br>
Next: A string of frustrating attempts in Southern Idaho  one in an <br>
amazing place, even if I struck out <br>
<br>
AND My first (successful) Boxing At Night!  And a nice little place <br>
to stay in Boise in cold weatherfor cheap, all before Day Two was <br>
over..<br>
<br>
Stay tuned for more.<br>

YOU'RE WELCOME for the Golden Spike info. I'm SO glad you were<br>
triumphant! I briefly considered asking you to carve that Pengy stamp<br>
for the Willard Bay Bird Refuge and I would hide it. Then I remembered<br>
what a mosquito hell that place is most of the year and decided I<br>
could not, in good conscience, lure unsuspecting boxers into certain<br>
anemia. So - no payback required. Just keep the entertaining<br>
commentary coming!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm enjoying this.  It's fun to hear about boxes I've found for a change on<br>
this list.<br>
<br>
When I found Golden Spike three years ago it was one of my earliest boxes.<br>
It still followed the trail markings.  If it is any consolation, I wandered<br>
around looking at a bunch or rocks for a while too.  I also almost stepped<br>
on a rattler--not too fun there!<br>
<br>
If GS was where you saw my stamp, it was actually my old stamp.  That was<br>
the first one I ever carved in my newfound letterboxing enthusiasm.  We will<br>
have to find some way to gather together and I can give you the image I've<br>
been using for a couple years.<br>
<br>
Happy hunting!<br>
Cadenza<br>
<br>
ps. Keep the trip report up.  I'm enjoying it!<br>
