So in scanning the archives, I see there isn't much of a tradition <br/>
of posting trip reports to any extent - for Major Road Trips with a <br/>
Boxing Purpose.  I'm a life-long world traveler, and some of the <br/>
sites I subscribe to do have this tradition...in exchange, I <br/>
suppose, for help/assistance/encouragement given PREvious to a <br/>
trip....<br/>
<br/>
As a newbie here/and a frustrated writer on this talk list, may I be <br/>
permitted to try it?<br/>
<br/>
....when I can't box, I amuse myself.......sewing/thinking about <br/>
boxes for next year/etc.<br/>
<br/>
If it's too much - please say so or just ignore this post.. and I'll <br/>
stop!<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, for anyone who cares to read on....<br/>
<br/>
and yep, there IS Pie.....eventually....<br/>

Haven't Got a Clue and Frozen Crap.<br/>
<br/>
My Thanksgiving Road Trip 2005 from Denver to Portland and back in <br/>
13 days and 3232 (.9!)miles..and doubling my letterboxing count, by <br/>
the way, a first and last time I'll get to say this.. newbie that I <br/>
am, but fact's is facts!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry parental ones..the "Cr*p" word, was the best I could come up <br/>
with..just nowand it's quite intentional and indicative. Ya'll <br/>
will see why, very soon ..if anyone cares to read on....<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
Everyone who really knows me wouldn't believe that I was literally <br/>
pulling away from the curb at 6 a.m. that Friday  the first day of <br/>
my first "real" vacation in 3 years..   But, those same folks would <br/>
know just how much traveling (and significant time off to do so) <br/>
means to me and that I CAN do stuff when I want totravel!  <br/>
Heck, "only 2 weeks", pre???<br/>
<br/>
I don't usually get out my passport/driver's license for less that 4 <br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
The story that must now be told is that I should have known what the <br/>
theme would have been for the trip that very first morning.  I <br/>
didn't of course, but I sure do now.<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
Car loaded the night before and having gloated about the trip for <br/>
weeks before hand, the morning of trip jitters (oh and the cats) <br/>
made sure I was awake, without alarm clock at 5 a.m. and raring to <br/>
go!  Shower, coffee for the road, and last minute items (mostly <br/>
food) to be packed.  <br/>
<br/>
Then to the car  arms loaded down. <br/>
<br/>
Every single door of the little green Subaru was frozen shut, even <br/>
the back tailgate which has no glass to rubber seal.  Not just a <br/>
little stuck  haha, snort grrr!   Tried kicking the metal part of <br/>
the door with a boot to try and break the seal between the glass and <br/>
the ice.  Prying the window/rubber seal with car keys?  Nope!  It <br/>
hardly ever gets this cold in Denver and there was no snow on the <br/>
ground.  But then again, I'm hardly ever up at 6 a.m. so what do I <br/>
know?  I do know that several years ago I did finally break down and <br/>
buy a hair drier.  I didn't bother to use it that morning, like most <br/>
mornings.  Extra time and mornings are not two things usually <br/>
associated together in my life.<br/>
<br/>
It took about 10 minutes of prying to finally get a door, any door <br/>
open to get into my car.  My wet hair now frozen solid to my head, I <br/>
wondered how many of my neighbors woke up with the sound of <br/>
profanity that morning?<br/>
<br/>
Then on to southern Wyoming.  And a headwind.  All day!  Grrrr.  All <br/>
10 hours of it to make it to the Ogden/Brigham city area.  Tried for <br/>
several letterboxes to make nice stops along the way.  Struck out <br/>
several times  including one I really wanted, but since I'm still <br/>
new to boxing, I think my patience for actually finding some when <br/>
I'm in the right area still needs some work. My comments re: <br/>
attempts at finds reflect ONLY my own frustration/nebieness-dom, and <br/>
are NOT in any way directed at the placers of those boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Der Mad Stamper's Lil Bug's Bungalow at Expedition Island where John <br/>
Wesley Powel set off for his Colorado River journey  That location <br/>
has been on my list to visit for years and the weather was chilly, <br/>
but clear so all was not lost.  A big huge rock was there, placed <br/>
since the place date of where this box sure seemed to be,  sat where <br/>
the bearings lead me.<br/>
<br/>
Encounter on the Oregon Trail, Don and Gwen  a 40+ mile round trip <br/>
detour for nothing.  I'm kicking myself for not stopping and really <br/>
registering the mileage in the clues when I didn't find the concrete <br/>
markers.I saw some brown metal road signs up ahead so went for <br/>
them.by then, I'd lost the .erm trail..sigh.In this case, so <br/>
much sage brush, so little time -  which I didn't have.  "The Oregon <br/>
trail, California Trail, Mormon Trail, and the route for the Pony <br/>
Express" all meet in one place (like SO many on my trip) and I <br/>
missed this box which really wanted.  I never did find out where to <br/>
get more info on the "audio tour" mentioned all those signsit <br/>
probably would have broken up the bad spots on the radio dialI <br/>
asked at several National Parks, etc, en route on what the Audio <br/>
Tour was "all about."  Many rangers tried, but could never <br/>
satisfactorily answer my Q....<br/>
<br/>
Home on the Range, Heather  YAY my first actual find for the 1st <br/>
day. Yipee!  A nice little local park just off the highway.  Wacky <br/>
geese and ducks with funky Mohawk hairdos greeted me when I got out <br/>
of the car.  My first inclination that although in our normal <br/>
everyday boxing worlds "just off the interstate" boxes aren't of <br/>
interest.......on Road Trips.....Not True!<br/>
<br/>
Imaginary Roadside Attractions: Improbable Parks/lisascenic.  The <br/>
description in the clues about how this box came to be was reason <br/>
number #1 to seek it out.  giggles!  Been in touch with the placer  <br/>
we talked bout significant detours "off route" to find nada, and <br/>
how  folks should visit this box more often.come on  you KNOW <br/>
you're bored to the point of suicidal at this point in the road!<br/>
<br/>
The camping spot I'd planned on was right by the interstate.  Ick!  <br/>
They did have nice holiday lights set up at the park right by the <br/>
Great Salt lake.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning I realized that I'd been feet away from The Rings <br/>
box by A and J Bears.  And I even Had The Clue printed up for this <br/>
one on me already to goThis would also become a theme <br/>
Grrr. But it Sure Beats Working!<br/>
<br/>
And that was only Day One<br/>

happened.  I'm dying to know if you found Golden Spike.  Some have had<br/>

&gt; with..just nowand it's quite intentional and indicative. Ya'll<br/>
&gt; will see why, very soon ..if anyone cares to read on....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Everyone who really knows me wouldn't believe that I was literally<br/>
&gt; pulling away from the curb at 6 a.m. that Friday  the first day of<br/>
&gt; my first "real" vacation in 3 years..   But, those same folks would<br/>
&gt; know just how much traveling (and significant time off to do so)<br/>
&gt; means to me and that I CAN do stuff when I want totravel!<br/>
&gt; Heck, "only 2 weeks", pre???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don't usually get out my passport/driver's license for less that 4<br/>
&gt; months.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The story that must now be told is that I should have known what the<br/>
&gt; theme would have been for the trip that very first morning.  I<br/>
&gt; didn't of course, but I sure do now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Car loaded the night before and having gloated about the trip for<br/>
&gt; weeks before hand, the morning of trip jitters (oh and the cats)<br/>
&gt; made sure I was awake, without alarm clock at 5 a.m. and raring to<br/>
&gt; go!  Shower, coffee for the road, and last minute items (mostly<br/>
&gt; food) to be packed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then to the car  arms loaded down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Every single door of the little green Subaru was frozen shut, even<br/>
&gt; the back tailgate which has no glass to rubber seal.  Not just a<br/>
&gt; little stuck  haha, snort grrr!   Tried kicking the metal part of<br/>
&gt; the door with a boot to try and break the seal between the glass and<br/>
&gt; the ice.  Prying the window/rubber seal with car keys?  Nope!  It<br/>
&gt; hardly ever gets this cold in Denver and there was no snow on the<br/>
&gt; ground.  But then again, I'm hardly ever up at 6 a.m. so what do I<br/>
&gt; know?  I do know that several years ago I did finally break down and<br/>
&gt; buy a hair drier.  I didn't bother to use it that morning, like most<br/>
&gt; mornings.  Extra time and mornings are not two things usually<br/>
&gt; associated together in my life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It took about 10 minutes of prying to finally get a door, any door<br/>
&gt; open to get into my car.  My wet hair now frozen solid to my head, I<br/>
&gt; wondered how many of my neighbors woke up with the sound of<br/>
&gt; profanity that morning?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then on to southern Wyoming.  And a headwind.  All day!  Grrrr.  All<br/>
&gt; 10 hours of it to make it to the Ogden/Brigham city area.  Tried for<br/>
&gt; several letterboxes to make nice stops along the way.  Struck out<br/>
&gt; several times  including one I really wanted, but since I'm still<br/>
&gt; new to boxing, I think my patience for actually finding some when<br/>
&gt; I'm in the right area still needs some work. My comments re:<br/>
&gt; attempts at finds reflect ONLY my own frustration/nebieness-dom, and<br/>
&gt; are NOT in any way directed at the placers of those boxes!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Der Mad Stamper's Lil Bug's Bungalow at Expedition Island where John<br/>
&gt; Wesley Powel set off for his Colorado River journey  That location<br/>
&gt; has been on my list to visit for years and the weather was chilly,<br/>
&gt; but clear so all was not lost.  A big huge rock was there, placed<br/>
&gt; since the place date of where this box sure seemed to be,  sat where<br/>
&gt; the bearings lead me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Encounter on the Oregon Trail, Don and Gwen  a 40+ mile round trip<br/>
&gt; detour for nothing.  I'm kicking myself for not stopping and really<br/>
&gt; registering the mileage in the clues when I didn't find the concrete<br/>
&gt; markers.I saw some brown metal road signs up ahead so went for<br/>
&gt; them.by then, I'd lost the .erm trail..sigh.In this case, so<br/>
&gt; much sage brush, so little time -  which I didn't have.  "The Oregon<br/>
&gt; trail, California Trail, Mormon Trail, and the route for the Pony<br/>
&gt; Express" all meet in one place (like SO many on my trip) and I<br/>
&gt; missed this box which really wanted.  I never did find out where to<br/>
&gt; get more info on the "audio tour" mentioned all those signsit<br/>
&gt; probably would have broken up the bad spots on the radio dialI<br/>
&gt; asked at several National Parks, etc, en route on what the Audio<br/>
&gt; Tour was "all about."  Many rangers tried, but could never<br/>
&gt; satisfactorily answer my Q....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Home on the Range, Heather  YAY my first actual find for the 1st<br/>
&gt; day. Yipee!  A nice little local park just off the highway.  Wacky<br/>
&gt; geese and ducks with funky Mohawk hairdos greeted me when I got out<br/>
&gt; of the car.  My first inclination that although in our normal<br/>
&gt; everyday boxing worlds "just off the interstate" boxes aren't of<br/>
&gt; interest.......on Road Trips.....Not True!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Imaginary Roadside Attractions: Improbable Parks/lisascenic.  The<br/>
&gt; description in the clues about how this box came to be was reason<br/>
&gt; number #1 to seek it out.  giggles!  Been in touch with the placer <br/>
&gt; we talked bout significant detours "off route" to find nada, and<br/>
&gt; how  folks should visit this box more often.come on  you KNOW<br/>
&gt; you're bored to the point of suicidal at this point in the road!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The camping spot I'd planned on was right by the interstate.  Ick!<br/>
&gt; They did have nice holiday lights set up at the park right by the<br/>
&gt; Great Salt lake.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The next morning I realized that I'd been feet away from The Rings<br/>
&gt; box by A and J Bears.  And I even Had The Clue printed up for this<br/>
&gt; one on me already to goThis would also become a theme<br/>
&gt; Grrr. But it Sure Beats Working!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And that was only Day One<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; pre...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; more soon-ish...<br/>

I looked up Golden Spike LB on LBNA and it looks like HER/preboxed DID<br/>

After CW Sun Seeker and I failed to find it last fall, I contacted Der<br/>
Mad Stamper. He related as much as he could remember about seeing the<br/>
Big Fill Trail only once 5 years ago and where he thought the box<br/>
should be. (To his credit, his memory was right on the money.) A-Bear<br/>
provided the map from when she had found the box (she must keep<br/>
EVERYTHING!) and guess what? The NPS has re-written the trail's tour<br/>
booklet and RE-NUMBERED THE INFO MARKERS!!! The marker referred to in<br/>
the clues is now in a completely different place. Indeed, there is NO<br/>
marker now within sight of the box location. Now armed with the old<br/>
map, CWSS returned to the trail and found the box. She emailed its<br/>
location to me and then I found it, too.  I emailed new clues to DMS,<br/>
but he has been busy with stuff and hasn't yet updated the clues on<br/>
LBNA. He gave me permission to send the new clues to HER since we knew<br/>
Golden Spike was on her itinerary. So a group effort and many emails<br/>
later, it looks like it was a success! Way to go, HER!<br/>

<br/>
Found my first box placed by someone else in Central Denver today <br/>
(12/22/05) on the way home from work today.(Rocky Mountain Choo <br/>
Choo/Treasure Finders  check it out and YAY!)<br/>
<br/>
Today we were sent home early..to 11 whole paid days off!  Wahoo, <br/>
don't mind if I do..<br/>
<br/>
As promised, here's the next update, particularly at the urging of <br/>
Cadenza ;-) Whose stamp I got to see for the first time on this <br/>
tripbut that's much later<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
Day Two belongs, boxing-wise, completely and utterly to Boxer <br/>
Lover..! and my own style of dumb freaking LUCK!  Oh, and Pengy.  <br/>
<br/>
I attempted to honor Boxer Lover when I did, in fact, log into <br/>
Golden Spike.  Without BL's postings on this list, and a few private <br/>
emails before my trip I never, ever would have found this box.  I <br/>
really, really, wanted this one.    Boxer Lover is My Hero!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Some of you may remember that I posted PREtrip that this box in <br/>
Promontory was on my list of "must haves" and definite stopovers.  <br/>
This National Park has been on my "to do" list ever since I moved to <br/>
Colorado..in 1999, and having recently become addicted to boxing, <br/>
well, ya'll know the rest.<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm also into penguins.  Since this trip was a solo trip, at the <br/>
very last minute on that very cold morning when I set off, I decided <br/>
to bring Pengy with me.He's an approximately 9" tall stuffed <br/>
penguin on the trip, with a homemade stylish fleece neck gatorof <br/>
course!.Which is what I've been sewing "to beat the band"in larger <br/>
sizes, of course.  Trip now officially paid off.<br/>
<br/>
The truckers on my tripped noticed him on the dashboard many times. <br/>
One of my many philosophies of life..If no one else can/will amuse <br/>
you, do it yer own danged self.snort <br/>
<br/>
Musta been the weather that cold morning.  Penguins can't fly, don't <br/>
ya know so Pengy makes me drive him everywhere.  He navigates (and <br/>
is crap at ithe wants to go everywhere and doesn't understand the <br/>
concept of Time Mangement!)  I also think Pengy might also be <br/>
stealing my PREquent flier miles for vacations to warm places like <br/>
Hawaii, cause I sure haven't been redeeming them lately<br/>
<br/>
So on the road from Ogden to Promontory there is a Bird <br/>
Sanctuary..I never knew that.Pengy got excited!  We both wished we <br/>
could have stopped to explore.  If anyone is interested in placing a <br/>
punny penguin to honor a bird from Antarctica.stamp in a bird <br/>
sanctuary located in desertlemme knowI'll carve the stamp!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I spent the 2nd morning of my trip talking to the Rangers at the <br/>
Golden Spike NP, doing some hikes and auto tours.  Tried to find out <br/>
information on some of the Audio Tours noted with brown signs I'd <br/>
passed many times on the interstate.  The ranger, bless them, bored <br/>
in off season, even got on the internet, printed me off a bunch of <br/>
stuff for other NPs and Welcome Centers, but could never hook me up <br/>
with info on what I wanted.  If anyone on this list knows more, love <br/>
to hear from ya.<br/>
<br/>
I'd highly recommend stopping by the visitor center before going for <br/>
the Golden Spike box .   Of course you need to find the NEW TRAIL <br/>
marker for this box  the numbers aren't even close to what's up on <br/>
Der Mad Stamper's clue sheet, but the interpretation in the guide, <br/>
imho, really makes the hike relevant from a historical perspective <br/>
even if (gasp!) there weren't even a box in the area.  For those of <br/>
you also "bag" NPS Passport Stamps in addition to your boxes, this <br/>
is a good one. <br/>
<br/>
For this next bit, I'm trying hard to walk the fine line between my <br/>
story but,  also not giving too much away for boxers, which of <br/>
course is very bad form.  <br/>
<br/>
Found the starting point for the new clues just fine.  I have a <br/>
geography degree, so I know my way around a compass, but I tell you <br/>
whatthis bearing grrr.So many rocks!  I kept rechecking my <br/>
bearing, and looked for at least half an hour for the box.  I <br/>
really, really, didn't want to give up on this one.but I'd burned <br/>
up a LOT of time this morning, and still had some major driving to <br/>
do for the day.  (Boxes in the Boise area had to be baled on as a <br/>
result, unfortunately.)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, "one more time" for this box.  Feeling stupid, blonde and <br/>
frustrated, I almost gave up.  Wait!  What's that sound?  That sure <br/>
didn't sound "right" where my foot just landed..  OMG!  I stepped <br/>
right on TOP of the box!  <br/>
<br/>
You should have seen me!  I'm not ashamed to admit I did the Disco <br/>
Version of Happy Dances on that trail!  There was screaming and <br/>
shouting with joy involved, as well <br/>
<br/>
Boxer Lover, I Owe Ya  Big Time for this most rewarding find!  Just <br/>
let me know when it's Pay Back Time!  <br/>
<br/>
I emailed DMS when I returned home with a status update.  I sort of <br/>
hoped the clues would be updated by the time I posted this part of <br/>
my trip report (a few days over a month since I left on the trip), <br/>
but see they haven't been updated yet.  All can say, boxers, is as <br/>
of 11/19/2005 the box IS THERE and in a place very unlikely to go <br/>
anywhere anytime soon.  If you want to contact me off list, I'll do <br/>
what I can to helpSince I haven't asked for permission as of this <br/>
writing, perhaps I should shoot DMS another email and ask if it's OK <br/>
if I, like My Hero, I can give out updated clues.<br/>
<br/>
I spent 4-5 hours in the Park and didn't leave for boring interstate <br/>
driving until about 2 pm.  Major Driving to do toward BoiseThat <br/>
didn't stop me from boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Next: A string of frustrating attempts in Southern Idaho  one in an <br/>
amazing place, even if I struck out <br/>
<br/>
AND My first (successful) Boxing At Night!  And a nice little place <br/>
to stay in Boise in cold weatherfor cheap, all before Day Two was <br/>
over..<br/>
<br/>

YOU'RE WELCOME for the Golden Spike info. I'm SO glad you were<br/>
triumphant! I briefly considered asking you to carve that Pengy stamp<br/>
for the Willard Bay Bird Refuge and I would hide it. Then I remembered<br/>
what a mosquito hell that place is most of the year and decided I<br/>
could not, in good conscience, lure unsuspecting boxers into certain<br/>
anemia. So - no payback required. Just keep the entertaining<br/>
commentary coming!<br/>

&gt; So on the road from Ogden to Promontory there is a Bird <br/>
&gt; Sanctuary..I never knew that.Pengy got excited!  We both wished we <br/>
&gt; could have stopped to explore.  If anyone is interested in placing a <br/>
&gt; punny penguin to honor a bird from Antarctica.stamp in a bird <br/>
&gt; sanctuary located in desertlemme knowI'll carve the stamp!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I spent the 2nd morning of my trip talking to the Rangers at the <br/>
&gt; Golden Spike NP, doing some hikes and auto tours.  Tried to find out <br/>
&gt; information on some of the Audio Tours noted with brown signs I'd <br/>
&gt; passed many times on the interstate.  The ranger, bless them, bored <br/>
&gt; in off season, even got on the internet, printed me off a bunch of <br/>
&gt; stuff for other NPs and Welcome Centers, but could never hook me up <br/>
&gt; with info on what I wanted.  If anyone on this list knows more, love <br/>
&gt; to hear from ya.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd highly recommend stopping by the visitor center before going for <br/>
&gt; the Golden Spike box .   Of course you need to find the NEW TRAIL <br/>
&gt; marker for this box  the numbers aren't even close to what's up on <br/>
&gt; Der Mad Stamper's clue sheet, but the interpretation in the guide, <br/>
&gt; imho, really makes the hike relevant from a historical perspective <br/>
&gt; even if (gasp!) there weren't even a box in the area.  For those of <br/>
&gt; you also "bag" NPS Passport Stamps in addition to your boxes, this <br/>
&gt; is a good one. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For this next bit, I'm trying hard to walk the fine line between my <br/>
&gt; story but,  also not giving too much away for boxers, which of <br/>
&gt; course is very bad form.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Found the starting point for the new clues just fine.  I have a <br/>
&gt; geography degree, so I know my way around a compass, but I tell you <br/>
&gt; whatthis bearing grrr.So many rocks!  I kept rechecking my <br/>
&gt; bearing, and looked for at least half an hour for the box.  I <br/>
&gt; really, really, didn't want to give up on this one.but I'd burned <br/>
&gt; up a LOT of time this morning, and still had some major driving to <br/>
&gt; do for the day.  (Boxes in the Boise area had to be baled on as a <br/>
&gt; result, unfortunately.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, "one more time" for this box.  Feeling stupid, blonde and <br/>
&gt; frustrated, I almost gave up.  Wait!  What's that sound?  That sure <br/>
&gt; didn't sound "right" where my foot just landed..  OMG!  I stepped <br/>
&gt; right on TOP of the box!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You should have seen me!  I'm not ashamed to admit I did the Disco <br/>
&gt; Version of Happy Dances on that trail!  There was screaming and <br/>
&gt; shouting with joy involved, as well <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Boxer Lover, I Owe Ya  Big Time for this most rewarding find!  Just <br/>
&gt; let me know when it's Pay Back Time!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I emailed DMS when I returned home with a status update.  I sort of <br/>
&gt; hoped the clues would be updated by the time I posted this part of <br/>
&gt; my trip report (a few days over a month since I left on the trip), <br/>
&gt; but see they haven't been updated yet.  All can say, boxers, is as <br/>
&gt; of 11/19/2005 the box IS THERE and in a place very unlikely to go <br/>
&gt; anywhere anytime soon.  If you want to contact me off list, I'll do <br/>
&gt; what I can to helpSince I haven't asked for permission as of this <br/>
&gt; writing, perhaps I should shoot DMS another email and ask if it's OK <br/>
&gt; if I, like My Hero, I can give out updated clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I spent 4-5 hours in the Park and didn't leave for boring interstate <br/>
&gt; driving until about 2 pm.  Major Driving to do toward BoiseThat <br/>
&gt; didn't stop me from boxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Next: A string of frustrating attempts in Southern Idaho  one in an <br/>
&gt; amazing place, even if I struck out <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; AND My first (successful) Boxing At Night!  And a nice little place <br/>
&gt; to stay in Boise in cold weatherfor cheap, all before Day Two was <br/>
&gt; over..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Stay tuned for more.<br/>
