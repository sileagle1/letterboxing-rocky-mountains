This might be a good time to talk to everyone about a spring get-<br>
together exchange in Moab in April. Sounds like Boxlover is heading <br>
this way in March. But can you come again in April? Are you there, <br>
Puppypaws? What dates are you coming to Moab in April? Kennamtn, <br>
Rivergeek, and I live here, and Y-nought could make it on April 10, <br>
11, 12, or 13th dodging around his work schedule. Esmerelda doesn't <br>
know her schedule that far in advance yet, but we can cross out <br>

everyone think? BBQ in Moab? Anyone else out there interested in <br>
joining the fun?<br>

I can postpone my trip until April when it looks like some of you can<br>
be there.  My best window is April 10, 11, 12.  I can do my Bullfrog<br>
scouting first, before swinging over to Moab.  I need to leave Moab on<br>
the 13th (or possibly very early on the 14th) to be home for<br>
out-of-town company.<br>

to this one.... Mmmmmm...pie!<br>

How many hours' drive is Moab from SLC again? It would be a long drive for <br>
sure. But, could be fun! Cadenza, any chance you might go?<br>

Wow! This is starting to look like an honest to goodness Gathering!<br>
<br>
The question was asked about distance from SLC. I think it is about <br>
four hours' drive.<br>
<br>
Boxerlover- How awesome that you can change your schedule.<br>
<br>
mt. walker from MT- Wait a minute, there's MOUNTAIN BIKING around <br>
Moab? <G> (Someone actually asked me that once).<br>
<br>
It sounds to me like Sunday the 10th might make it possible for the <br>
most folks. But if anyone is thinking of coming and can only make it <br>
the 11th or 12th make sure to speak up. Once we know roughly how many <br>
people there will be, we can decide on a location and a more firm <br>
time.<br>
<br>
This is truly amazing because the first real letterbox to be placed <br>
in Moab was  placed just last August. Now there are twenty-something <br>
great boxes. It's such a fun place for letterboxing.<br>

Wow! How cool will this be? If we can get a rough idea of how many <br>
people, I could reserve a spot at Rotary Park, which is downtown, <br>
easy to find, and has lots of room for the kids to run around. The <br>
weather should be warm enough for a bbq by then. (There are also 2 <br>
boxes already planted nearby.)<br>
<br>
It is about 4 hours from the Salt Lake City airport, and 4 hours <br>
from Park City. I have driven it often in 3 1/2 hours, depending on <br>
how many trucks and campers are on Hwy. 6 through Price.<br>

in if it's any day in that April 9 - 13 time frame.<br>

Ah yes, Arches. Now that you mention it, I remember seeing those <br>
clues briefly before they updated letterboxing.org. Those clues got <br>
sent to the basement of that site literally a couple of weeks after I <br>
started 'boxing. I couldn't believe my luck at that time, when I <br>
found out that Ryan and Amanda had come through the Four Corners <br>
Area. Without them it would have been pretty sparse around here.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know what you mean.  They left a few up in my neck of the woods too.<br>
 I still had to travel 2.5-5 hours to find the various boxes, but for<br>
me that was still in my neighborhood.  I didn't know about them<br>
initially b/c they were on their site and not LBNA.  I was so excited<br>
to find out that there were actually a few boxes out here.  It's funny<br>
isn't it, how different our perspectives are out here than from, oh,<br>
say Connecticut.<br>
<br>
I think the 11th should work for me.  I am getting so excited about<br>
this, I can't believe it.  I will have to pull some things together,<br>
b/c I will still need to take a day off work to get home.  I think I<br>
can leave after my morning committments on Saturday.  It will be about<br>
a 8 hour drive for me.  Mt.  Walker, are you feeling up to heading<br>
down?<br>

drive! LOL! It is funny how far we'll go out here in the west. I <br>

For those of you that are thinking about coming to Moab and dabble a <br>
little in postal letterboxing, I plan to bring a Stanley Manor Murder <br>
Mystery HH with me.  For those of you that don't know what this is, <br>
it is a murder mystery series that I created for only postal LB's <br>
that include 11 clue HH's and stamps.  There is a sleuth stamp for <br>
those that solve the crime.  This is a great opportunity for those of <br>
you that participate in PLB's to get a clue.  See you in Moab.<br>

Hi Puppypaws!<br>
<br>
I've seen the jet boats around town getting ready for the season. I'm <br>
pretty sure they are running it now, but I'll find out and let you <br>
know. I'll see the owners tomorrow at preschool and find out what kind <br>
of schedule they are running right now and get back to you on that <br>
tomorrow!!<br>
<br>
So, Kennamtn and Rivergeek are back in town, and sooooooo excited <br>
about meeting everyone. They are coming over tonight with New Zealand <br>
stamps and pictures! Too much fun!!<br>
<br>

Hello all,<br>
More and more folks are joining the gathering! It's quite entertaining<br>
reading all the posts. Trying to learn the history of this group has<br>
my brain spinning. I give up! Will just have to wing it, I guess. I<br>
will be the clueless one.<br>
<br>
I head out from Ogden tomorrow morning. Have a little side trip and<br>
then will be in the fair city of Moab Saturday afternoon. I am staying<br>
at the Rustic Inn under the name of Judy Wagnon. If anyone is up for<br>
some boxing late Saturday afternoon or into the evening (day light<br>
savings time!) or Sunday morning, leave a message. Or my cell phone is<br>
(801)721-3041.<br>
<br>
Any updates on the weather forcast for the weekend?<br>
<br>
I'm so looking forward to meeting you all!<br>

Thanks guys for all the directions - I like one about looking for the <br>
folks with ink on their fingers.  I am looking forward to meeting all <br>
of you......I just took a test to see what kind of "dog" I was and I <br>
came out looking like an border collie - energetic, intelligent and <br>
when left alone too long, gets neurotic.   So, there you go,  Puppypaws<br>

planted half of them!  If you need help, company, pie, smiles, good <br>
times. . .you just let us know!  We're always up for a good <br>
adventure.  <br>
There's a box listed on Atlas Quest that is in Arches  (Arches <br>
Amphitheater, I think), and Kat and I went to look for it <br>
yesterday.  We weren't too hopeful, considering it's a national <br>
park.  It wasn't there, but the area is absolutely beautiful!  We <br>
were just excited for a new box!  When exactly are you going to be <br>
here?  I have a stack (really. . .a STACK) of boxes that I need to <br>
plant still, and if I can get them out there before you come, you <br>
can hoard all the FF's!  <br>
Sounds like it's going to be a great trip.  Lots of boxing and <br>
beauty!  It sure is a nice little piece of the country we live in!<br>

<br>
Oh, and for everyone else who's wondering about Moab being busy. . . <br>
after the marathon this past weekend, it has all thinned out again.  <br>
Not too many people.  Until next month, that is!  So if you're still <br>
wanting good times with fewer people, come before April 7th or 8th!  <br>
After that. . .it's buses, bikes, crowds, climbers, rafters, hikers, <br>
jeepers, sightseers. . .and don't forget letterboxers!  Enjoy!<br>
