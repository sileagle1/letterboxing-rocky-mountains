Oh and ...this coming Friday on my way home from work I'll be <br/>
replacing my season Play Ball! box....I've decided that since it's a <br/>
seasonal box, that'll I'll be providing a NEW STAMP each year....so if <br/>
this one is on your "found" list and therefore Poof! gone off <br/>
your 'boxes to find list...well I'm just saying...track it down..count <br/>
it as a find, or not.  Same clues, no FF this time, but a new stamp <br/>
for 2007.  (Rockies Opening Day April 2nd)<br/>
