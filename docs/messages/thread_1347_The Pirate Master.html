Well, you know, the one thing really lacking on the show is pie.  I <br/>
mean.  Come on.  Pie.  They're eating gruel for Pete's sake.  If I <br/>
were captain it'd be pie city.  And there would be WAY more singing.  <br/>
It's so much easier to swab the deck to the sound of a hornpipe and a <br/>
bawdy pirate ditty.  <br/>
<br/>
I sooo want to scamper up that rigging and watch those sails catch <br/>
the wind.  <br/>
<br/>
And the running around in the jungle with maps and compass?  Dang!<br/>
<br/>
Let's all audition for the next round.  Come on.  It'll be fun!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Es, who would never cut any of you adrift.  Probably. <br/>
