Hello Gathering attendees-<br>
<br>
Front Range Hiker sent this out on Atlas Quest, but I thought I might <br>
repeat it here for those of you who are not quite as compulsive about <br>
checking AQ as we hostesses might be!  We are expecting nearly 60 <br>
people next week and we have lots of fun things planned in addition to <br>
the great boxes in the area.<br>
<br>
If anyone can bring any potluck goodies to share (pies in particular!) <br>
it would be really great.  If you can bring something, please let me <br>
know by e-mail or AQ mail so we know what to expect and what we will <br>
need to get.<br>
<br>
Thanks, everyone, and I look forward to meeting you or seeing you again <br>
next weekend!<br>
<br>
allemeyn<br>

yesterday's gathering together.  They went all out and did a fabulous<br>
job!   We greeted old and new friends, found boxes, exchanged stamps, did<br>
a poker run (we collected cards from select letterboxes), had a treasure<br>
box pinata for young and old alike that when finally broken spewed out<br>
lots of cool stuff ... little handmade logbooks and stamp pads and gold<br>
chocolate coins, etc.  Oh, and we ate pie.  By the way, Tai Chi makes a<br>

There was an absolutely insane epidemic of cooties.  They were turning up<br>
all over the place.  For a while, I was feeling like I'd contracted<br>
measles, shingles, and chicken pox all at the same time.<br>
 <br>
I will hopefully post a few photos later today.  I'll admit now that I<br>
didn't take too many photographs, because I was pretty much immersed in<br>
ink most of the day with cooties, exchanges, personal travelers, regular<br>
boxes, surprise boxes, event stamps, hitchhikers from the visiting Big<br>
Bison Hitchhiker Hostel.  Whew!<br>
 <br>
Thanks again to the organizers for all their hard work and for providing<br>
such a fun and memorable time for us!<br>

It was a total HOOT!  Our first event.  It was so much fun to be able <br>
to put faces to names/stamps.  A, FRH, Pre...thanks so much for all <br>
your hard work.  Count on us to help organize the next one.<br>

their hard work on this gathering. Even though we arrived late in the <br>
day, we were impressed with the planned activites, and everything was <br>
so well-organized!<br>
<br>
It was great to put more faces to names/stamps...some people being <br>
like celebrities in our home! The kids especially loved finally <br>
meeting Tai Chi and Chai Tea. We had followed them to so many boxes <br>
around the Front Range. They are the sweetest people! <br>
<br>
A special thank you to Preboxed for helping our oldest daughter with <br>
her first stamp-carving. She will soon venture out with her own <br>
letterboxing identity/trail name; this is destined to be a lifelong <br>
addiction (I mean, hobby).<br>
<br>
While the eldest son and I hit the road to find the day-only boxes, <br>
the 3 little kids (with big sister's help) enjoyed making their own <br>
logbooks with the supplies donated by the organizers. These logbooks <br>
are already being used and are officially finding a home in my LB <br>
backpack. Thanks again for encouraging this activity!<br>
<br>
Looking forward to the next event :-) We plan to enjoy our CO <br>
letterboxing days to the fullest until the Air Force decides to move <br>
us on. <br>

When we stumbled across Letterboxing on the Internet a few months ago,<br>
we were excited to find a hobby we both could enjoy. It was really<br>
cool to meet some of the people we had been seeing stamps for in the<br>
LB logs we had found. <br>
<br>
What a fun group! It's always fun to meet people from diverse<br>
backgrounds and lifestyles and Letterboxers seem to be just that!<br>

We'll look forward to the next event, meanwhile hope to see you on the<br>
