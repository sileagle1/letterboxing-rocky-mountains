So I was sitting at the bench in Larkspurshire. Trying to keep my legs crossed (wearing a kilt) and chomping a raspberry Italian Ice.......when POOF!<br>
<br>
...... Ravenwolf, Sparkle Fairy, Samurai Stamper and Brother Raven appear from nowhere. It was a totally chance meeting and the Renaissance Faire is big enough that we could easily have missed each other entirely.<br>
<br>
But it sure was good to chat with some dear (crazy,letterboxing) friends again.<br>

There WE were, enjoying food on a stake, watching some entertainment, when I looked over and what did my wolfy eyes spot? A Y! In a kilt! A Y I knew even! What chance! What luck! <br>
<br>
We rushed over and much merriment ensued! We even got to meet his lovely bride and chat for a bit. Even Elros wandered over with his lady friend in tow (although, he was rolling his eyes, and had that look that said 'oh man - it's those crazy letterboxers. We can't go anywhere without them showing up'. =3 )<br>
<br>
Kidding, kidding. Many smiles and hugs were exchanged.<br>
<br>
Next time we will have to put a shout out that we are going to be there. Sorry we missed you, BoxTops! We are actually planning another foray later in the year. If it pans out, we will be sure to say something.<br>
<br>
Merry meet, Sir Y and Lady Paloma!<br>

Elros and a lady friend?  Wasn't it just yesterday he was like 12?  I'm sure Y-nought isn't any older - I know I'm not!<br>
