get back up there! I've been to dozens of other places down there <br>
within sight of that hoodoo, but always with nonboxing friends who <br>
would never appreciate what we do! It was worth it as we found some <br>
fun ruins and artifacts within spitting distance of that box! Reece <br>
is going to go back down there this weekend and see what else he can <br>
see. I thought he was going to piece together a complete pot when we <br>
were up there last! We had a lot of fun looking around and taking <br>
pictures of the stuff.<br>

Es, if  we have that gather in this area where I don't have to have a cream<br>
pie sitting in a warm car for the 8-12 hours it takes me to get to other<br>
gatherings I will bring one for you.  There is a favorite bakery of mine in<br>
this area that makes a killer raspberry cream pie.  It's yummy vanilla cream<br>
with a layer of raspberry on top--mm, mm, to die for yummy!<br>
