The CO folks are depending on you to bring nightboxing to CO!!<br/>
Could it be that you are making this project too big?<br/>
<br/>
I planted the first night box in NC in 2005 with pieces of reflector <br/>
tape in an old slave cemetery that you could get through the gates at <br/>
night.  It's practically a driveby.<br/>
<br/>
Not much to that one but everyone LOVED it and it sparked the GA <br/>
folks to start nightboxing and take it to a whole new level.<br/>
<br/>
People still enjoy that old, simple 2005 box for the setting.   So I <br/>
say JUST DO IT!  Just put out one so people get the idea and then it <br/>
may just take off.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be taking Front Range Hiker to do some nightboxing here-- simple <br/>
ones --only one of which has reflector stuff (the others are just <br/>
accessible day or night).<br/>
<br/>
Set a deadline, no excuses, someone plant ONE nightbox by Halloween.<br/>

Yo! With LOTS of help from my buddies in the South East I PREsent:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.atlasque st.com/showinfo. html?gBoxId= 95997<br/>
<br/>
I almost gave up on this one again this year..but NO. It's planted! <br/>
If/when anyone is interested in making a night box, please get in <br/>
touch. I'm happy to share the bunches of info I learned in the <br/>
process. #1 seems to be - the paint that everyone else talks about <br/>
simply does NOT work here. Maybe it's an altitude thing?<br/>
<br/>
Oh and AF, a LOT of what pre types IS cryptic clues and/or references <br/>
about boxes (sometimes teasing about those in the works.) Wolfie calls <br/>
it Planet Pre....Boxer Lover and A - thankies! <br/>
<br/>
Just trying to keep things interesting (yeah, yeah I know "interesting" <br/>
sometimes equates to "weird") around here! I can live with that....<br/>
<br/>
pre<br/>
*seriously guys and gals - I'm in the Game for the long haul. Never <br/>
forget that when something seems "off" Might take a while to "get it" <br/>
(even in bits) but a few have or are starting to. I just wanna <br/>
Play! :-)*<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and Happy Halloween!<br/>
<br/>
BOO! :-)<br/>
<br/>
So I say JUST DO IT! Just put out one so people get the idea and then <br/>
it may just take off.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll be taking Front Range Hiker to do some nightboxing here-- simple <br/>
ones --only one of which has reflector stuff (the others are just <br/>
accessible day or night).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Set a deadline, no excuses, someone plant ONE nightbox by Halloween.<br/>
