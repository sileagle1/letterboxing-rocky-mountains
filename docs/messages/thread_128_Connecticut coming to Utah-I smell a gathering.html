Lake City to meet up with her kids from Hawaii.  She was shocked at the<br>
dearth of letterboxes in these parts, to which I explained that there is a<br>
dearth of letterboxers in these parts.  I think she is still a bit blown<br>
away by the fact that letterboxing is still pretty new to the Rocky Mountain<br>
Area.<br>
<br>
Anyway, she is planning on bringing a bunch of carvings out from other Conn.<br>
boxers so they can leave a collection for us to work with.  She and I have<br>
been talking about the possibilities of meeting on January 4 and 5.   I<br>
think she has at least a dozen offers to send new letterboxes at this point.<br>
<br>
I have been excited to meet her and then the thought occurred to us that<br>
maybe this would be a good chance to let others know about her coming and we<br>
could arrange a gathering for any letterboxers who might like to come from<br>
other areas.  I know there are only a handful of boxers in Northern UT so I<br>
decided to post the invite here and see if we are able to get any kind of<br>
response.<br>
<br>
Let me know if any of you are interested in meeting.  I would love to meet<br>
any and all boxers that I can.  This should be a lot of fun!  I hope some of<br>
you might be able to make it!<br>
