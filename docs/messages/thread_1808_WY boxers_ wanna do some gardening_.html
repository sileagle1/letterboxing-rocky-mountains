                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey gang. We're coming through this weekend on a whirlwind Teton/YS visit.<br/>
It was my best intention to have one box ready to plant, but there just<br/>
isn't going to be time! If I carve up my box, maybe another or two if I get<br/>
inspired, would someone be willing to plant for me? The one I'm sure of<br/>
would be for Grassy Lake Rd between Teton and YS. The second, up north if we<br/>
hear/see wolves - please, please!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! Aljan... who is pretty sure she heard the highway calling and is<br/>
sooo not in the office today, at least in spirit - in body only.<br/>
