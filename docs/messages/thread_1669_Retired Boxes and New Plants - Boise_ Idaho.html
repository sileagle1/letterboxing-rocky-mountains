Tonight I retraced my planting steps to their original hiding places and only found two boxes remaining and one stamp between the two.  This series is now retired until further notice.  In their place I have planted a new series of two boxes called Joe's Crab Shack: <br/>

Blackvelvetrav Plants 100 in Garden City is also temporarily retired.  I have the box in my possession and the stamp and logbook are fine but the lid on the container was not staying on tightly enough.  I will replace the container and re-plant the box in a new location soon.<br/>

More spring cleaning to come!  Happy Hunting Blackvelvetrav<br/>
