<div>I'm going to sneak in a friendly little reminder to please, please, please, make sure that you seal up baggies and boxes well. I just had the brand new log for Fodor (His Daytime Resting Place) get completely water logged and ruined becausethe baggies weren't closed and the box was left open. I am just sick about it. :(</div>
