I think I mentioned this was a possibility when this box was placed.  <br/>
One of those risks with urban boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
I bike to/from work several times a week (in fact I did so today), so <br/>
if you think it would help, I'd be happy to swing by here and check on <br/>
it.  Heck I may just be PREsumptuous and stop by there on my way home <br/>
tonight.<br/>
<br/>
(Fingers crossed for no deluges at commute hours this week!)<br/>

I remember, you did try to warn us, but, we just were having such a <br/>
hard time finding a spot for it!  We would be grateful if you have a <br/>
chance to check on it on your way home....ONLY if it's not <br/>
stormin'...Lightening and bikes just don't mix!  Be PREtty Careful!<br/>

there to try and give it a visual block ARE still there, <br/>
however....grrr.  Had a good peek around under the bridge (which <br/>
doesn't look at all freshly painted to me) to see if someone who'd <br/>
found it might have tossed it somewhere.  Just found the signs of <br/>
some recent beer drinking...probably using the bridge to hide out <br/>
from all our recent rain??<br/>
<br/>
While I was in the area I had a peek for 5280 and must say I was <br/>
appalled at how it was just sitting on top of the rocks.  I didn't <br/>
look in the logbook, just took my second and pushed it back down in <br/>
the cracks and threw some rocks on it....busy night for bikers and <br/>
joggers...but it's all tucked away and safe now.<br/>
<br/>
I'll email you offline with add'l comments, including a possible <br/>
idea for a new hiding spot, if you're thinking of replacing this box.<br/>
