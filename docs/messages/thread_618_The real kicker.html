I recall asking Sunday night if we could move back the Monday morning meeting time to 7:30 to get more sleep.  You all mentioned that you had a long drive ahead of you and wanted to get going early so we needed to be there by 7:00 and if we were not there by 7:15 you would leave without us.  Now, who was the one that lived up to their promisses to be on time?  Hmmmmm.  HA!  By the way, did you see the special "wave" that Stubby left for you in the last 2 boxes?  It was a pleasure boxing with each of you and hope to see you all again very soon.<br>

-------------- Original message -------------- <br>
Will Stubby the Toothslayer keep going? We were a pretty nutty bunch to <br>
begin with, but when you get us sleep deprived from a combination of <br>
driving, staying up carving on top of that, running around on trails all <br>
day, and just plain full of letterboxing excitement, we must just look like <br>
a psychotic bunch! We'll have to try it again with more sleep . . . Oh, who <br>
am I kidding?<br>
We did get back to both Searching and Ticaboo, well it was my 1st time at <br>
Searching. I loved the spot and absolutely loved the clue. I will admit to <br>
frustration initially as we passed many of what I considered to be boulder <br>
fields and house size rocks (Blackvelvetrav asked "what value home? 1 Mill? <br>
70K? :) But when we got to the one the clue referred to, I thought "this has <br>
GOT to be it! Big and hard to get around." I'm a LOTR fan too, so the clue <br>
was just fun. I wrote the poem down in my logbook to remember. It was nice <br>
to see that it was from someone who did the books, not just the movie. Not <br>
everyone knows about things like entwives. I also emptied my film at Tikaboo <br>
with some fun scenery. I love that country!<br>
Ramdelt, I think we just missed you at searching. We got there with <br>
Boxerlover too and kidnapped her to go find more boxes together. CW <br>
Sunseeker and I spent a lovely afternoon hitting more boxes on 128 with her.<br>
I'm still just tickled with finally being able to put names with faces and <br>
sharing the time with all of you. I've never met another boxer on the trail <br>
in my life and this weekend I bumped into five or six on the trail and about <br>
the same number in restaurants. It was a kick! I've always been so jealous <br>
of those eastern types talking about seeing others out hunting on the same <br>
trail! I can't tell you how fun it was for me to pull up to Moab Man for a <br>
quick find before the gathering after 8-9 hours of driving, and to spot <br>
A-Bear and find out CW Sunseeker, Blackvelvetrav and Lizman were in the car <br>
along with Ramdelt and Stubby, who they had bumped into earlier. It was such <br>
a surreal experience for me! Now I need more of those.<br>
till later,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">(Cadenza nodding sheepishly) It was actually primarily my fault. We got up <br>
in plenty of time, but unfortunately my tube of toothpaste exploded in my <br>
bag and I spent much of the morning trying in vain to get toothpaste out of <br>
everything. Then my shower had plumbing problems. It was just a crazy <br>
morning. I think we were right behind you on both of the boxes though. I <br>
then stayed for a while after the Boise boxers left. I'm embarrased to say <br>
how late I left! Suffice it to say, I was up into the middle of the night <br>
and then some! It was worth it though for more boxes. I particularly enjoyed <br>
the Westerns. It hurt to leave some longer hike ones behind. I'm glad I <br>
still got an early start, even if it was about 20 minutes later than what we <br>
said we "had to" do. <br>
