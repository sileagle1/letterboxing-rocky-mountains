                    <div class="plaintext-content">Y...do you have any more clues for us?  Need more clues!  I was <br>
thinking about NUMBER when you mentioned you saw those horse statues <br>
and of course the train.  Could the number be the TRAIN number or Track <br>
number.  Is the track between the train and the horse statues.  24/7 <br>
questions may be asked...maybe you have to ask the Depot the track <br>
number???<br>
<br>
Just thinkin'...need more clues!<br>
<br>
Hugs, Dreadly...who got married on a train...awwwww!<br>
