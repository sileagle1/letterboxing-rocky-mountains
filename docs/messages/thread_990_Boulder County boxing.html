                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wantedto let everyone know how great the boxing in Boulder County was yesterday.  We found every silngle box that we attempted.  The Daytime Resting Place of Fodor Glava, A Road-Side Incident, Scott Carpenter, A Flower for John and Eva, WOM box, Niwot Cemetary, Butterfly Trail, and Pelle Crossing are all alive and well.  The only one that may have a questionable future would be the Butterfly Trail.  When we got there the box was open with snow sitting on it in plain sight.  This would have been very easy for someone to find and destroy!  We placed the cover over the box and put it as far under the bridge as possible, but this box may be in danger.  Thanks to all creators!  I left hitchhikers in 2 of the boxes incase anyone wants to head out soon.  One we had brought back from Arizona.<br/>
