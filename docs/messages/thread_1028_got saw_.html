use some quick help from someone who has some woodworking tools, <br>
basically a saw.<br>
<br>
Need a backing for a 3x4" stamp and I have found nothing PRE made <br>
that will work.  Up to 1" thick.  Have asked someone at work a month <br>
ago, and so far not been coughed up.  Hack! <br>
<br>
I have an extra idea for the backing, which would require more time <br>
to really get what I want, but if you can "hook me up" with at least <br>
the right dimensions I would be ever so grateful.  Can be wood, <br>
plexi, or any other material in the the right dimensions.<br>
<br>
Would willingly trade sewing project or poking around Denver for <br>
something you can't get "there."<br>

Anyone who replies, off list, to this message (whether or not you <br>
can help with this PREquest), just might find themselves the <br>
recipient of a foolish WOM in aprox a month's time :-)<br>
