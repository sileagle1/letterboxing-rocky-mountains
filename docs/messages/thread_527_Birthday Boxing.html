So, last Thursday was my birthday, and I just have to tell you what <br>
kind of friends I have. They are the best. Kennamtn carved four <br>
stamps of different kinds of places and things that I love in life <br>
and cut them out in puzzle pieces that fit together. With each stamp <br>
she wrote one of her awesome poems that had clues to the next stamp. <br>
So it started at work with one that I had to figure out to find the <br>
next and so forth, until the last one told me to go to another <br>
friend's house, where everyone planned a surprise party for me. She <br>
hid them all around Moab and I had to drive up to a half hour to <br>
find one up a canyon north of town. Wow, I was just blown away by <br>
the time that was spent planning everything! So much fun!!!<br>

What an awesome idea! That sounds like such a great time, and a <br>
pretty sneaky way to set up a surprise party.<br>
<br>
Happy birthday, Kat.<br>
