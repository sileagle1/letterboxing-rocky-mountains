 Incident Date November 16, 2007 Time 8:42:00 AM Division Gold Hill <br>
Shift I <br>
Title Other Location 4065 N. Cheyenne Canyon <br>
Summary Officers were dispatched to Cheyenne Canyon on a suspicious <br>
package that was left in a picnic ground. Officers responded and found <br>
a box looking object that was dark in color and had tape around it. The <br>
object was sitting on the ground next to a picnic table approximately <br>
25 feet from the road. Officers thought the object was suspicious and <br>
called for the bomb squad. Bomb Techs, Sgt Fraiser and Sgt. Clayton <br>
responded and x-rayed the package. It was determined that the package <br>
was not an explosive device.  <br>
