Silver Eagle, if you will be heading up I-25 on Saturday afternoon <br/>
it might work quite easily to meet up for an exchange. <br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in finding Huzzah, Huzzah we could wait for <br/>
you at the fair parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Or if you were coming through later we could meet you in (or at) <br/>
Castle Rock. <br/>
<br/>
I think there is a rest area around there somewhere too if you <br/>
wanted the quickest possible exchange.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought I would throw that out there in case it would be <br/>
possible. And if Kris or others are interested we could have a pre-<br/>
gathering mini-meet just for quick exchanges.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if this is possible because I would love to meet up and <br/>
get a copy of your stamp into my logbook.<br/>

We will be coming from Amarillo to Denver, so not sure<br/>
what time I will be in Larkspur/Castle Rock area.  Maybe<br/>
around 4 or 5.  Is the box in Castle Rock in a nice park?<br/>
If so, my family could enjoy that for a little bit while<br/>
we Exchange.  Or if there is a better place nearby that<br/>
works for you and others, I could try to be there.  The<br/>
problem is I won't know for sure what time, so you might<br/>
have to wait a while and I don't want to hold you up.<br/>
If it was just me I would make it work, but with a <br/>
non-letterboxing family it makes it tough.  Let me know.<br/>

How far out of the way do you think you might be able to go without the <br/>
supportive family? I can't break away during the week b/c of work and I have <br/>
important committments for the 30th. I hate to miss you yet again (I think I <br/>
was out of town last time you guys came). I may be able to sneak away to <br/>
Jackson on Sunday evening. There is a new box there that hasn't been able to <br/>
be posted yet. I would love to go find it. If you may be coming out that <br/>
way, since it is closer to the Tetons, I may be able to swing over.<br/>

That would be great if we could meet somewhere along I25.<br/>
We will be coming from Amarillo to Denver, so not sure<br/>
what time I will be in Larkspur/Castle Rock area.  Maybe<br/>
around 4 or 5.  Is the box in Castle Rock in a nice park?<br/>
If so, my family could enjoy that for a little bit while<br/>
we Exchange.  Or if there is a better place nearby that<br/>
works for you and others, I could try to be there.  The<br/>
problem is I won't know for sure what time, so you might<br/>
have to wait a while and I don't want to hold you up.<br/>
If it was just me I would make it work, but with a <br/>
non-letterboxing family it makes it tough.  Let me know.<br/>

&gt; It so happens that Y and the wee noughts (actually nought so wee <br/>
&gt; anymore) will be at the renaissance fair in Larkspur on Saturday <br/>
&gt; also. We will probably be watching the jousting in the afternoon <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; will leave the fair at about 3:30 pm. After that we were thinking <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; heading up to Castle Rock to look for a rather new letterbox.<br/>

&gt; Silver Eagle, if you will be heading up I-25 on Saturday afternoon <br/>
&gt; it might work quite easily to meet up for an exchange. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are interested in finding Huzzah, Huzzah we could wait for <br/>
&gt; you at the fair parking lot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Or if you were coming through later we could meet you in (or at) <br/>
&gt; Castle Rock. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think there is a rest area around there somewhere too if you <br/>
&gt; wanted the quickest possible exchange.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just thought I would throw that out there in case it would be <br/>
&gt; possible. And if Kris or others are interested we could have a pre-<br/>
&gt; gathering mini-meet just for quick exchanges.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let me know if this is possible because I would love to meet up and <br/>
&gt; get a copy of your stamp into my logbook.<br/>
