                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks JelyBean for the information on the Roxborough Letterboxes and <br/>
your input with the rangers.  I love Roxborough Park. It was  my <br/>
intention to draw in more money and good folks (ie. Letterboxers). I <br/>
also made both boxes where the person finding them would NOT have to <br/>
get off the trails and damage the environment. I do not have <br/>
permission for either box (Puma Prints, or Hiker's Boot).  Should I <br/>
contact them and get permits?  I believe both boxes would be approved. <br/>
I am planning on going up on Carpenter's Peak and checking on Puma <br/>
Prints this Thursday - anybody want to meet me there??  It's the <br/>
perfect time of year for this hike.    Puppypaws<br/>

boxes are being left there graciously by the Rangers, but I think it <br/>
would help Letterboxing's image if we showed we were willing to work <br/>
within and respect the parks people's policy (holy alliteration, <br/>
Batman!).  It'd be nice to say PuppyPaws' Puma Prints is permitted by <br/>
Park policy.  (OK, I'm just being silly now.)<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I emailed Drew Clan about the missing Fountain Valley box, <br/>
sent him the policy and offered assistance in replacing that box if <br/>
they choose to do so.  Maybe you're a better choice though, since I <br/>
live in the Springs and you seem to be in Roxborough more frequently <br/>
than I.<br/>
