I was told that they were setting up for a film there about a couple of baseball players during World War 2.  I think that they said it was called something like "American Pastime".  They had the track covered with a stage and baseball setup and didn't want some crazy letterboxer trouncing around the set.  Can you believe those Hollywood producers???!!!<br>
