The Denver Broncos Turn 50 LB is reported missing! ::sigh:: Apparently, the tree that was supposed to be protecting it was cut down! At the top of my suspect list would be the guys who cut down the tree. We are totally bummed out because this is the 4th Bronco box to go missing. We thought we had the perfect spot, and it was getting alot of activity, as recently as April 24th it was okay.

So sorry your box is missing!  :(<br>
