without her in SLC lately and have to admit it's a lot easier.  I know,<br>
I'm a bad mom!  Are you bringing Liberty?<br>
<br>
Don't know if CWSS will be back by then or not.  West TX has had a new<br>
letterboxing blitz since she's been there!<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing you and Pet Lover and our new friends from<br>
last spring's gathering and hopefully new faces, too!<br>
