Hmmmmm, I can see a cleared street from my 3rd floor apartment, but <br/>
city dweller that I am I don't have a shovel and 10 bucks says any <br/>
store I can walk to, that is open, won't have any left.<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking about taking a nap....<br/>
<br/>
Safely tucked away with food, craft projects, power and the <br/>
kitties...just no idea when I'm going anywhere and, fortunately, no <br/>
hollyday plans that were in the works necessitating battling the <br/>
weather.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, and Santa, any chance of getting a shovel with a bow on it <br/>
this year?  Extra points if a cute guy with a strong back to use it <br/>
accompanies this wittle gift....to accompany only my 3rd white xmas <br/>
ever.<br/>

I phoned the homeowners association and they stated that since the property lines extend into the alley, it is the homeowners job to remove the snow.  He was also not sure if the city would plow the road or not.  Therefore we many be stuck for days since we cannot get any cars out.  This stinks!<br/>

Are you guys over there all okay and hunkered down with plenty of <br/>

safe and sound! Take care of yourselves and be safe!<br/>
