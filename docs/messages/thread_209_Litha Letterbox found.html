box was reported missing TWICE, but it turns out that it was simply stolen,<br>
and moved.<br>
Thankfully some WONDERFUL geocachers replaced the box, and provided the<br>
clues you'll see below.  If anyone goes up after this box, or the Flying<br>
Cloud (on the same trail) - please let me know if you find the box alive and<br>
well.<br>

> We went out GeoCaching today and on our way down from a find we stumbled<br>
across your letterbox. We thought it was another GoeCache, so we went to<br>
take a look. After signing the book and moving on, we came home to look it<br>
up. We discovered that we found it in another location then the one you have<br>
listed. It notes on there that it was stolen. We hid it better then when we<br>
found it and we also took GPS readings as to where it was. Park at the<br>
Stagosaurus lot off of State Road 26 south of I-70. Take the trail from the<br>
south end of the lots going up. At the top of the ridge you will see<br>
shooting range warnings on the left side. There is a gate on the left side<br>
when the trail levels out. The east side of the trail is a low rock wall,<br>
the letterbox is hidden at the southend of the first bush under some rocks.<br>

geocachers that rescued her!<br>
