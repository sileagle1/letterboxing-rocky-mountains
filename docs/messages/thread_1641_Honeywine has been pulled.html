We checked on Honeywine today and the box was wet, so we took it along.  Thankfully, the journal was spared of damage despite the Ziplock not being sealed!  We have used quality Rubbermaid containers, but this is now the second one that seems to have failed.  Is it Lock-n-Locks we need to switch too?  I'll let you know when it gets back out.<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
We checked on Honeywine today and the box was wet, so we took it along. Thankfully, the journal was spared of damage despite the Ziplock not being sealed! We have used quality Rubbermaid containers, but this is now the second one that seems to have failed. Is it Lock-n-Locks we need to switch too? I'll let you know when it gets back out.<br/>
