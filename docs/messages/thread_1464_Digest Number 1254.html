Okay, fine, fine.  I'm Eliza B, formerly of Seattle, now out on the<br/>
plains, lurker on this list for a few weeks now.  (The<br/>
husband-type-person does a lot of business in Denver and kind of wants<br/>
to relocate that direction.  We're there a *lot* when the snow isn't<br/>
flying.)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I have pie.  Made it this morning, in fact.  It's just<br/>
garden-variety apple, but I can make a *mean* cherry-peach, when I'm<br/>
in the mood. :)<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked how we found letterboxing:  Back in 2001, I was on a<br/>
Carving Consortium mailing list, and one of the members had a link on<br/>
her website (there weren't a lot of "blogs", per se, back then.) to<br/>
LBNA and it was *all* downhill from there.  I'd been carving my own<br/>
stamps for a long time at that point, so I made a signature stamp and<br/>
found Amanda of Seattle's  Schmidt Park boxes and was hooked.  One<br/>
might possibly say obsessed.  (One would be right.)<br/>
<br/>
There's been a three year lapse in boxing for me, since there aren't<br/>
many of 'em out where I live, but theyr'e starting to pick up out<br/>
here, and I've evangelized so much that I've got a couple friends into<br/>
it now, too.  So it's looking up. :)  We're headed out to the Denver<br/>
area over Father's Day weekend and plan to 'box for all we're worth<br/>
when we're not oogling sheep.<br/>
