Her name is Kelly.  She's nine weeks old with those infamously sharp milk<br/>
teeth!  We got her on the Western Slope in Crawford where a pack of junk<br/>
yard Border Collies were rescued out of neglect.  Although we weren't<br/>
planning to train another search and rescue dog, Kelly is definitely<br/>
looking like she has the potential.<br/>
<br/>
Boxer Lover has a new puppy too.  Guess what it is?<br/>
<br/>
~Silent Wings, who had said she was on a dog break for at least a year<br/>
... let's see ... we made it 5 months<br/>

new infomation about Boxer Lover and her new pup.<br/>
<br/>
I added a photo of our pup with the boys to the Catamount Pumpkin Carvers album, which I <br/>
now see should have just been titled Catamount Carvers.  Anyway to change that ... Y-nought?<br/>
