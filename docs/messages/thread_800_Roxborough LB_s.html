Park are now gone!!! They have a new manager at the park and he will <br/>
be looking into letterboxing at Roxborough.  I did get back the <br/>
logbook on Hiker's Boot, at least,  and they gave me the other box <br/>
that had been there so long --  Fountain Valley.  I will mail this <br/>
logbook to the owner if he wants it or if anyone wants to adopt this <br/>
one, let me know...the stamp needs repair or recarving.   They tell me <br/>
that letterboxing probably will be allowed at Roxborough later and <br/>
that I may be able to put one inside the Visitor's Center.  I am <br/>
trying my best to be patient with these people  -- I have asked them <br/>
repeatedly to let me know if they don't allow them and I would remove <br/>
them - but apparently they forgot. I actually gave  them the <br/>
instructions on where they were located - and they found them!!!  I <br/>
will now just remove these two from the LB website.  I absolutely love <br/>
this park and I hope it's future is secure.  If you have not been <br/>
there, you are missing a real treat - even without letterboxes. <br/>

and goodwill you put into keeping those letterboxes in the park. It <br/>
sounds like they may change their minds in the future but that doesn't <br/>
help much now. I really wanted to find all of those, but I guess I <br/>
missed my chance. Dang!<br/>
<br/>
On a happier note. We sure enjoyed finding the Rock last week. Great <br/>
clues and a really neat spot to hide a box.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>
