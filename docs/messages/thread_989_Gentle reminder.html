I've been reading the posts, and (admittedly) laughing a lot.  <br/>
However, I wanted to remind everyone that some of our group members <br/>
are Geocachers as well as Letterboxers.  <br/>
<br/>
Jely, that article was hilarious - but folks, let's just remember <br/>
that we're all in this together, and I dont want posts that may <br/>
insult some of our other members.  This isn't a geocaching message <br/>
board, but I wouldn't want anyone who participated in both hobbies to <br/>
feel unwelcome.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the posts asking for cache trinkets to be removed from boxes <br/>
were appropriate, and I will add my two cents that if anyone finds <br/>
trinkets in my boxes, please take them out, and do whatever you need <br/>
to to ensure that cachers dont mistake my box for one of theirs.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>

direction of the posts starts to go anti-caching.  We all have our <br/>
opinions of geocaching (good or bad) I just want to make sure that <br/>
some of our newer board members knew we had cachers among us, and <br/>
didn't want them to feel jilted.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I agree - let's hope that those among us who enjoy both activites can <br/>
help spread the word in the geo community about how boxing works and <br/>
to please not take our beautiful hand-carved stamps!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
