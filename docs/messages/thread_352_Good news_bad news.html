           I just noticed a new letterbox in southwest Colorado! <br>
(yay!) It is called Kokopelli of the Ruins and is near Cortez. <br>
(woohoo!) But the map is still messed up so it is listed as being on <br>
the Front Range. (doh!) I'll send Wes a note to put it on his list of <br>
fixes next time he is working on the site. Maybe I should have had a <br>
look at that spreadsheet like Silver Eagle did for Texas.<br>
