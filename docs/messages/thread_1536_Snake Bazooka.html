What you need is the patented JeLyWorks Snake Flinger 9000.  You've <br/>
seen those tennis ball flinger thingies that people use for their dogs, <br/>
right?  Well this pretty much works the same way, except that it folds <br/>
up into a compact size for carrying in a backpack.  If you encounter a <br/>
snake, you slowly back away, then push a button and the flinging arm <br/>
telescopes out about 20 feet and latches onto the snake.  Then you <br/>
turn, place the arm over your should for leverage, and whang that <br/>
sucker about three miles.  It's the latest thing.  I understand there <br/>
will be an exhibition of snake flinging as a new potential sport at the <br/>
Beijing Olympics.<br/>

I've got a rat bazooka, too.  So.  You just whang that snake up nice <br/>
and high where I can get a good shot at it...<br/>

Es, loading the snake bazooka and taking aim<br/>

That gold medal will look good with my pirate duds.<br/>
