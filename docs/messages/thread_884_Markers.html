                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry, SW, to be so slow posting a reply. I actually DID type up a<br>
reply yesterday, but then my computer decided to blitz my work before<br>
I could send it. (Whimpers) I don't have a lot of patience with that,<br>
so I had to walk away before I threw it across the room.<br>
<br>
The fatter markers I use by Uchida are called Marvy Brush Markers. I<br>
find they don't take as long to ink up the stamps and so I usually<br>
don't have to huff on them because they don't dry out as fast. The<br>
down-side to them is that it's hard to color very small sections with<br>
the wider tip. The colors you mentioned wanting to buy extra are #5<br>
yellow (bright) and #16 pale orange (flesh). I'm looking to get<br>
another "flesh" that has a bit more pink to it.<br>
<br>
I got 2 sets at Michael's (primary set and victorian set) which gave<br>
me pretty good variety. My Michael's has a very limited selection of<br>
markers you can buy individually, so I went online to buy a few<br>
singles. I can't remember the company now, but will do another search<br>
to see if I find one that rings a bell. Whoever it was, they had a<br>
pretty good selection (but not ALL the colors Marvy makes) and they<br>
were fast filling the order. I think the price was less than the $1.99<br>
at Michael's, but then there's the shipping charges. One problem with<br>
ordering online is that the color swatches are not always true to the<br>
marker, so I didn't guess right on all the colors I ordered.<br>
