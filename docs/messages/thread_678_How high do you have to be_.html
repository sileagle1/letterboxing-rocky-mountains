Vail when someone says "Colorado High Country". But, only as an <br>
invitation, I'd like to point out that the San Juan Range in <br>
southwest Colorado has 13 peaks above 14,000' and another 21 peaks <br>
above 13,800. That's 34 of the 100 highest peaks on Colorado, far <br>
more than any other Colorado Range.<br>
<br>
I even had to stop typing for a minute, just to catch my breath!<br>
<br>
There is a lot of high country in Colorado.<br>
