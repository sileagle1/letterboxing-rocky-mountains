The Onion is no more. In a comedy (tragedy) of errors during the last <br/>
couple of weeks my 87 year-old father lost messages, which lead to <br/>
the Nice Open Space Ranger leaving for the weekend and the Evil Space <br/>
Ranger throwing away the logbook and stamp. This really stinks. I was <br/>
SO very happy at the prospect of keeping a copy of your stamps in <br/>
that journal, and I understand it was nearly full. <br/>
<br/>
The only thing I can do to make it feel better is to plant another <br/>
Onion. This crop will be near the old onion patch. I hope to get up <br/>
in that area in the next couple of weeks. When it is in the ground I <br/>
will post revised clues.<br/>

Too funny, JelyBean. I happen to know that you solve that kind of <br/>
puzzle as a way to rest between harder puzzles. I am cooking up a new <br/>
one, though, that you might enjoy. I just need to get out and box!!<br/>

Pretty amazing the Nazi-ranger threw everything away, you would <br/>
think that a good look at the journal and stamp would tell him that <br/>
this was something special. Something that took time and skill on <br/>
y's part and all the people who stamped in with their little <br/>
beauties. My condolences to the onion and co.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad that little old dog found a cozy fireplace to sit near <br/>
during this storm. I'm surprised the electricity wasn't crackling in <br/>
the air today over Grand Junction as Pirates and Kats were boxing at <br/>
apparently the same time. We slid and slipped through the grey-green <br/>
mud, through a homeless person's camp and emerged victoriously at <br/>
the Zeb Sixteen Ton box to claim our miner!<br/>

something special.  What good is a permit?  I don't think I will hide <br/>
anything in Jeffco.   This really stretched my brain to solve this puzzle, <br/>
so I hope the next one is very similar.  hee hee - wouldn't want tooo many <br/>

Ooh, Ooh, yes, come and hide away in Negro Bill Canyon. That is such <br/>
an awesome canyon. I only go there in the winter because my dogs <br/>
bark at all the other dogs and it's soooo embarrassing. Yes, Yes, <br/>

&gt; well wouldn't you know - I just solved the Onion puzzle(with a <br/>
little help <br/>

and Chi <br/>
&gt; Tea were the ones up there looking for it when the ranger told <br/>
them the <br/>
&gt; problem with Onion.  I am also angry the ranger could not tell <br/>
this was <br/>
&gt; something special.  What good is a permit?  I don't think I will <br/>
hide <br/>
&gt; anything in Jeffco.   This really stretched my brain to solve this <br/>
puzzle, <br/>
&gt; so I hope the next one is very similar.  hee hee - wouldn't want <br/>
tooo many <br/>
&gt; stretch marks.    (I have enjoyed the banter about the Moab area - <br/>
one of my <br/>
&gt; favorite places.  I may have to hide a box in Negro Bill's Canyon <br/>
next <br/>
&gt; April.)  Is there one there?<br/>
