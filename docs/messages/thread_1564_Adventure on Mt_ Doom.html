                    <div class="plaintext-content">Early this morning with my two trusty helpers Sasha and Elwing, I <br>
packed up the Pearl with three large bags full of most excellent <br>
letterboxes and headed up to Mt. Doom.  <br>
<br>
Bring mosquito spray.<br>
<br>
Carefully we worked our way across and up the great mountain, <br>
planting and writing clues, leaving beacons and discussing routes.  <br>
Higher, nearly to the bleeding troll we climbed.  When, without <br>
warning, the skies opened up and a deluge poured forth!!  Scrambling <br>
into a nearby hobbit hole we hunkered down, telling stories and <br>
hooting when lightening split the sky!  Sasha made a raincoat out of <br>
one of the plastic bags.  But I'm never supposed to tell anyone <br>
that.  <br>
<br>
Eventually the skies cleared and the sun broke through and we headed <br>
up to finish our task.  Nearly to the top we discovered that King <br>
Theoden had escaped from the bag and was nowhere to be found!  Oh, <br>
no!  Elwing said, 'uh.. who's going to bring him back up here if we <br>
find him?'  She's a trouper.  <br>
<br>
The view from the Nazgul and Witch King took our breath away.  I wish <br>
I had my camera with me.  <br>
<br>
After much rock scrambling and careful climbing all of the new boxes <br>
were resting safely in their homes, waiting for their much <br>
anticipated visitors.  We crept down the mountain, searching for the <br>
elusive Theoden all along the way.  He was hiding in the trunk, the <br>
rascal.  He'll go back up when the last few boxes arrive.<br>
<br>
We drove home with the top down, the sun drying our clothes.<br>
<br>
Bring mosquito spray.<br>
<br>
Es, who has to take Sasha and Elwing to the movies tomorrow to pay <br>
them back<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds like quite an adventure, Es! And thanks for the tip about the mosquito spray - I'll check my stash.<br>
<br>
I'm SO excited about the Mt. Doom adventures.  I think I will hit 250 finds on Mt. Doom.  I like to have special boxes for my "milestone" finds, and it sounds like any of the Mt. Doom boxes would do the trick nicely.<br>
