                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today we headed downtown to The Chocolate Bar to drop off a new logbook for Chocolate Covered Lover:  http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=6141  I received an e-mail from the shop owner that the logbook was almost full.  I have to admit that this is one of my favorite older plants.  The box was originally planted in May of 2005.  How can you go wrong with Chocolate and Letterboxing in one stop?  I am not sure who will visit this box next but I did leave behind a treat or two during my visit.  They did let me know that the shop will be moving around the corner in July and will hopefully send me an e-mail to update the clues when it happens.  It will be in the same block so finding the shop should not be too difficult even if they do not update me immediately.<br>

Happy Chocolate Hunting!  Blackvelvetrav<br>
