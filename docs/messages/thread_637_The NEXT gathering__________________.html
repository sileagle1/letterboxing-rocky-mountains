I love the idea of the Ren Faire....however....I think something in <br/>
Denver or Fort Collins would be better.  The further distance for <br/>
those in Idaho may make it too far to travel.  There also isn't the <br/>
same number of "nearby" boxes to hunt down.  If we hit Denver or Fort <br/>
Collins, people could spend a full weekend boxing like we did in Moab <br/>
within a close distance to the gathering.  Any thoughts?<br/>

&gt; I would LOVE to try and be there.  Haven't been to the ren fest in <br/>
forever!  Kinda tough for me to get time off in July...  A Sunday, <br/>
late, or Monday would be good for me. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Oooooh, missy, I'm not ready to concede oldest boxer status to <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Y and I have been kind of chatting about a possible gathering <br/>
near <br/>
&gt; &gt; the Ren Faire on the east slope at the end of July.   Because, <br/>
&gt; come <br/>
&gt; &gt; on... Pirates! Kilts! Letterboxes! Pie! Woot!  Anyone interested?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Es, who thinks the old letterboxers should get the most pie<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I just got home last night and have been reading all the posts <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; enjoying all the photos. Can you stand one more message about <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gathering?  Of, course, you can!! I had such a fabulous time <br/>
&gt; this <br/>
&gt; &gt; past<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; weekend +! So much fun to match names and faces and see all of <br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wonderful stamps. The exchange frenzy was a finely <br/>
choreographed <br/>
&gt; &gt; hoot!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I added 17 Fs to my puny pre-event total and 23 Xs, which is way<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; amazing since, where I live, I never thought I would get ANY of <br/>
&gt; &gt; those.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; [Puppypaws and Kittylady, I seem to have missed your stamps!:-<br/>
&gt; ( ] <br/>
&gt; &gt; The<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Moab/Y/Es crew have hidden such a plethora of Lbs for the rest <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; &gt; us<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to seek. And now there are even more thanks to the forsight of <br/>
&gt; &gt; recent<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; visitors. Thanks to those who played along with my attempt at <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; personal traveler game; I cherish your participation. I got one <br/>
&gt; &gt; first<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; find, Y's To the End of the World with its most incredible view <br/>
&gt; &gt; (and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; climb). Woo hoo! <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; While it is true that the hunts and rewards were splendid, the <br/>
&gt; real<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; treasures were the nutty people whom I count as new friends. It <br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; such fun running into you on the trails: Ramdelt and Stubby at <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; beginning of Searching (fortuitous because I didn't get their <br/>
&gt; &gt; stamps<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; at the exchange); A-Bear, CW Sun Seeker, Cadenza and Alex at <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; top<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of Searching and Blackvelvetrav after her dash for coffee; <br/>
Aljan <br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; company when I went to re-stamp at CO River on Monday. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I certainly am relieved to learn that all the ID and CO people <br/>
&gt; &gt; made it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; safely home. CWSS, please check in soon. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now having met a bunch of you, I believe I can claim the title <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; OLDEST in the age war, which is ironic because I am also <br/>
&gt; probably <br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; NEWEST in this group to succomb to the Lbing fever. Surrounding <br/>
&gt; &gt; myself<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with younger folks (younger either in years or spirit) has long <br/>
&gt; &gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my stategy in the war against the clock. Thanks for sharing your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing ideas and techniques with a newbie.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Many, many thanks and praise go to Kat, Y-nought, Kennamtn and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Rivergeek for your efforts and hospitality. Aspen, I loved the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; flowers! I still have many more magnificent canyons to hike and <br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to find around Moab. There will be return trips, for certain.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And now, who/what/when/where will the gathering on the eastern <br/>
&gt; &gt; side of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the mountains be?<br/>
