I love the idea of the Ren Faire....however....I think something in <br>
Denver or Fort Collins would be better.  The further distance for <br>
those in Idaho may make it too far to travel.  There also isn't the <br>
same number of "nearby" boxes to hunt down.  If we hit Denver or Fort <br>
Collins, people could spend a full weekend boxing like we did in Moab <br>
within a close distance to the gathering.  Any thoughts?<br>
