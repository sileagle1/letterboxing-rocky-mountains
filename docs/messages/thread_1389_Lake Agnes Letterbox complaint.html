park is off limits now. Sorry, Jay in CT<br>
<br>
<<<Message: <br>
There is an unauthorized letterbox within the Colorado State Forest <br>
State Park called the Lake Agnes Letterbox. We do not allow <br>
unauthorized letterboxes or geocaches. We will try to find and remove <br>
it however if you could notify the placer perhaps they could remove it. <br>
We do place our own geocaches. We currently have 8 in the park. We are <br>
very selective with the placement of these caches. Geocaching.com does <br>
not allow the posting of a cache within our park without our <br>
permission. Please stop the posting of unauthorized letterboxes. Please <br>
acknowledge receipt of this e-mail. Thank-you>>><br>
