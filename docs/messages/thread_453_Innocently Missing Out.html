Sooo, there I was yesterday, innocently making Christmas candy and <br>
mailing packages (ok, so they don't make it in time, I know, I know, <br>
just waiting until the last minute), when I felt the cosmic airwaves <br>
whirring around. Little did I know that it was just my boxing <br>
buddies online having a great day of chatting and now here I am, <br>
starting the morning out with a great round of laughter at <br>
yesterday's posts. Thank you everyone for such fun, even when we <br>
aren't actually out there doing "our thing"!<br>
Sooo, yesterday I gave a hiking buddy her Christmas present, which <br>
was a journal, exacto pen, compass, and some ink dots, and you <br>
should have seen her face. Such fun. I have dragged her out on many <br>
a hike, now she is dragging me out to find boxes, starting last <br>
night, we made her stamp, and she dragged me out to find one of my <br>
boxes in the dark, (night hikes, always and adventure). And thus.... <br>
a new addict is born. She has been wanting to be involved for <br>
months, but didn't really know where to begin. While fooing around <br>
practicing with the knife, she ended up making a really fun stamp, <br>
which will appear on a trail near us soon!!<br>
