I was just in Denver boarding our last flight of the day where it was <br/>
a balmy 12 degrees at the airport.. as my toes approached snapping off <br/>
coldness the captain said, 'who would ever go to the game when it's <br/>
this cold?' I told the captain, 'I know two people who are gonna be at <br/>
the game come heck or high water!' <br/>
<br/>
How the heck do you stay warm?!<br/>
<br/>
Es, who knows Skeetch is watching for a camera shot of the dreadlies <br/>
in the other room<br/>

on the way home from our Christmas party when the light rail wasn't <br/>
running on any kind of obvious schedule.  I ride the thing to work <br/>
every day, so I know how to read the schedule and something was <br/>
clearly way, way off on Saturday night.<br/>

I looked for ya, though, seeing as I know exactly where you sit now.  <br/>
Didn't see ya, though...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">ES!  You need those handy, and oh so warm, hand/foot warmers that <br/>
they sell to the 75,000 crazed fans willing to brave the cold just <br/>
to watch some even crazier football players take to the field and <br/>
throw around what must be like a frozen ice block called a football <br/>
down the field!  WOOT!  We had a blast!  And, those warmer jobbies <br/>
do the trick! Oh, and did I mention layers...layers and layers of <br/>
clothing!  Actually, we've been to colder games when the wind adds a <br/>
nice "Jack" frosty touch!  But, last night wasn't windy which helped <br/>
a great deal!  There was a beautiful full moon out...trying to warm <br/>
us...and the stadium lights seemed to be trying too.  The camera man <br/>
to the left of us attached a big 24" square room fan under his <br/>
camera to keep his lense clear!  It was so funny to see!  I was so <br/>
tempted to just run over and breath a bit of pirate air on it!  <br/>
AAaaarrrr!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Alas, it wasn't a pretty game to watch, but, the warm welcome the <br/>
fans gave to Cutler was awesome, AND, his first touchdown pass was <br/>
right in front of us!  COOL!  When Al Wilson went down, it seemed <br/>
surreal with the whole stadium shouting, "WILSON, WILSON, WILSON"!  <br/>
He scared the heck out of us, but sounds like he'll be okay.  We <br/>
love that guy!<br/>
<br/>
Jrsyboy....I'm so sorry that you had a light rail fiasco Sat. <br/>
night!  Dang, why does that happen when you need them the most!  <br/>
Maybe you did see me...did you see an orange popsicle jumping up and <br/>
down with a Santa Hat on???  Ha!<br/>
<br/>
Hugs, Peach...Dreaded the outcome of the game, but who enjoyed the <br/>
warm ambiance of 75,000 fans sitting under a frosty full moon!  It <br/>
was a blast!<br/>
