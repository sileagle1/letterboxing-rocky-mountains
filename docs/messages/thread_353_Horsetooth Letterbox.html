<br>
I just got word from Larimer County that my Horsetooth Letterbox has <br>
been pulled because "nothing can be placed in the park without prior <br>
approval".  Jeez - I feel like a criminal or something!<br>
<br>
Anyway, I just moved to San Diego (got here this afternoon as a <br>
matter of fact), so will not be able to pick up my letterbox from <br>
the parks office.  I wrote a nice email politely asking if there's <br>
some sort of permitting process I could go through to get the box <br>
replaced, but we'll see what happens.  I have a feeling that the box <br>
will not see any more action - at least for a while! <br>
<br>
I'll update the clues on the main page to reflect the current status <br>
of the box, but I thought I'd let you guys know too, just in case <br>
anyone had printed out the clues.  I'll keep you posted on what I <br>
hear.<br>
