It looks like there are a few people interested in meeting up over <br>
the last week of December.  Does anyone have any suggestions of <br>
places that may be somewhat central to the local boxers, or easily <br>
accessed anyway?  What time is best for everyone?  Lunch, dinner, <br>
after dinner?  I'm really pretty open, so anything will work for me.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to meeting everyone!<br>
Bali<br>
