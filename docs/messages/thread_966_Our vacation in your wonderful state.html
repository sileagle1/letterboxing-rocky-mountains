                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all - I'm back home now and wanted to tell you what a wonderful<br/>
time I had in Colorado.  I was able to leave you a box but haven't had<br/>
time to post the clues yet - it will be called "A Gift From Oregon"<br/>
and lies outside of Coaldale a ways on the Rainbow Trail.  We weren't<br/>
able to find any boxes actually placed by you Colorado boxers,<br/>
although we looked for JelyBean's Turret Ghost Town box - ran out of<br/>
daylight and thought it would be too dangerous to "go for it" even<br/>
though we did find the location before we had to leave the area.  We<br/>
also found a box called Rainbow Trail placed by Edna, who lives in<br/>
Missouri, and it sure could use some attention.  I e-mailed her and<br/>
encouraged her to try to get some help from local boxers - its lid is<br/>
broken, log book is damp, and stamp is missing, although there is one<br/>
in the box left by a letterboxer.  It's such a huge box that I<br/>
couldn't hide it any better than it was when I came across it - really<br/>
out in plain sight, and it has morphed into a kind of hiker log book -<br/>
tons of entries by hikers passing by and checking it out.  Since it is<br/>
damp and broken, I didn't hide it any better than I found it so people<br/>
will continue to empty water out if it gets in.  Anyway, we thoroughly<br/>
enjoyed our time together and loved the Cabin on Shelf and Red Canyon<br/>
Park boxes, also all the gorgeous places we were able to see.  You<br/>
truly have a wonderful state that rivals my own, and I don't say that<br/>
lightly, because Oregon is known for its scenic attractions.  I am<br/>
especially impressed with your parks and roadside recreation areas,<br/>
nice bathrooms, no fees, so well maintained.  Can't wait to come back.<br/>
 Hope you all enjoy the little present I left for you, although if<br/>
your unseasonably warm weather changes no one will see it until<br/>
spring/summer most likely.  Your boxing friend, Calli-K aka Kathy Gilbert<br/>
<br/>
