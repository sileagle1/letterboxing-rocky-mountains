                    <div class="plaintext-content">A couple of weeks ago I hid a new letterbox in the Red Canyon area of <br/>
Daggett County UT, high up above Flaming Gorge.  I stewed about the <br/>
location because it was possibly doomed to disappearing by muggles <br/>
camping/hiking/sight-seeing nearby.  So I returned a couple of days ago <br/>
to move it to a more secure location.  I see that the clue has gotten a <br/>
few hits in the interim and I wanted to send out a notice to anyone on <br/>
this list who may have taken a look that the clues have changed, so <br/>
please re-print them if you are going that way.  <br/>
