again next year, or plant it at another faire in another state. I <br>
may even just take it to the faire with me and make it a one or two <br>

for awhile. :)<br>

Hi, I thought I should join in the conversation finally. I've been <br>
reading this site but not joining in until now. So howdy from Moab, <br>
Utah to everyone. Today was an another awesome day. Took little one <br>
up in the La Sal mountains above Moab to hike and play in the first <br>
snow of the year.<br>
We thought we should take a box up there to hide, and so we did!<br>

Woohooo...another Moab box!  Keep 'em coming!  One of these days <br>
when you least expect it our pirate ship will sail into town. <g><br>

Had hopes to find a box and plant one but the kids had so much fun tearing around while I planted a new box (put clues up last night!) that we ran out of time to hunt.  *harumph*  Another day.  Couldn't believe there was SNOW in the shady spots on the trail.  Wrong I tell you, sick and WRONG!<br>
