                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today I replaced box # 1  Silver Screen that has been MIA since last <br>
summer.  The clues are very similar although the container is now <br>
magnetic.  We walked the loop to check on # 2  Pieces of Silver & # 3 -<br>
 Silver Spoon and box #3  Silver Spoon seems to be MIA now.  The dogs <br>
love to visit the dog park and walk the trails off leash.  It was <br>
incredibly beautiful and sunny for our walk although a bit muddy on the <br>
last  mile (after the location of box # 3).  I will try to get them <br>
down there again as soon as I re-carve # 3.  So many boxes - never <br>
enough time!<br>
