RE: A Bard's Tale: Count me in as well. I've actually gone to the <br>
trouble of looking up old maps in colorado looking for some of the <br>
references in the elusive Bard's Tale. If nothing else, it's quite <br>
the challenge.<br>
<br>
RE: HH's: I can't BELIEVE we forgot to stamp in The Meaning of Life <br>
stamp into the HH!! (hides nose under paw TOTALLY chagrined!) We <br>
stamped the HH into our logbook, and the Meaning of Life logbook, our <br>
stamp into all of the above - but we forgot that last one! If you <br>
want to email me offlist, I can tell you where that the Pony Express <br>
HH started out. I didn't even notice that the original placer hadn't <br>
put it in there. *sigh* nice catch tho!<br>

RE: Yellowstone: Cadenza - we will be in Yellowstone the 30th-Aug 3. <br>
I'm not sure where we are going from there. I can attempt to email <br>
you and let you know. We are going with my parents (non-LB's) and <br>
plans are not set as to whether we are going to head south, or west <br>
from there. If there is any chance of seeing you, we would love to!<br>
<br>
Thanks much! <br>
