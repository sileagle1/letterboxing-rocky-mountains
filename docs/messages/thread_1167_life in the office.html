                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know the feeling, Pre.  Somehow knowing that I am leaving my job has made<br/>
things that were just mildly difficult feel intolerable.  I'm lucky that I<br/>
do have a light at the end of the tunnel, but when I think about that I get<br/>
overwhelmed too.  There is so much I need to do between now and October!!<br/>
The wedding thing is tough enough, but then you add in another reception in<br/>
another country, immigration and visa hassles, getting licensure transferred<br/>
to another country, and packing up everything and trying to move into a<br/>
one-bedroom flat, which means I need to sell or donate nearly everything I<br/>
own, well, I'm feeling the stress!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to go on an off-topic rant, but I'm feeling a bit frazzled too.  I'd<br/>
like to say that I'm doing some letterboxing to get away from it all, but I<br/>
haven't had a moment.  I haven't even looked for a box this year.  I want<br/>
to, but haven't found the time.  I'm hoping that things will calm down a bit<br/>
so I can.  I know I need to at least get a few done because I want to do the<br/>
Dr. Who ones for Andrew when he comes out here.  I know he won't respond to<br/>
Dartmoor boxing.  I think it's more fun to box in the US to tell you the<br/>
truth, and he doesn't really like the moors.  He definitely doesn't like the<br/>
rain that hits the UK at any given time, and storms blow up unexpectedly at<br/>
Darmoor on a regular basis.  I figure if I can hook him here on a beautiful<br/>
mountain trail with a clever clue, he might not fight as hard when I want to<br/>
head down to England.<br/>
<br/>
I also need to clean up a few boxes.  I have boxes that have done well over<br/>
the years, but suddenly I'm getting emails from all over the place that my<br/>
boxes are missing.  I have one in Wyoming that is only the second box I ever<br/>
planted.  It had done well in it's little spot for three years, a geocache<br/>
got planted near it recently and suddenly the box has been moved three times<br/>
and the stamp went missing.  Luckily Daelphinus (sp?) of dvn2r ckr was nice<br/>
enough to do a quick recarve and move it back to where it was supposed to<br/>
be. Now, I just know someone will lambast me for blaming geocaching, but it<br/>
seems rather funny that it didn't move for three years, but the moment a<br/>
geocache came along, it has gone all over the place!  Anyway, I want to redo<br/>
a few key letterboxes in the area.  Some will just have to be retired, but<br/>
there is only one active letterboxer in this area besides me who plants<br/>
boxes, and she isn't super active.  I have a few that are key ones for<br/>
helping connect people to the process (decent carvings, easy finds, in nice<br/>
family friendly locations) that I want to replant.  We'll see if I can<br/>
manage to find the time, but I'm not holding my breath.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, the joy!  Okay, I've avoided work long enough.  I better get back on<br/>
task.  Y'all have a great day, okay!  Until later.<br/>
