I don't think there is a size guide.  That box is really, really <br/>
small.  Most boxes have booklets in them that are about the size of <br/>
3x5 cards.  So - it should fit on a page with room to write.  Eric <br/>
and I both use erasers that we carved.  So, typically, we can both <br/>
stamp on one page together and sign the book, too!<br/>

&gt; Ok, stamp size guidelines would have been helpful. We did our first <br/>
find yesterday, and couldn't stamp! It was the micro one at Garden of <br/>
the Gods - what a cool hiding concept. My husband is all excited to <br/>
start placing.<br/>

My stamps are too big! I'll need to order in some material, so it <br/>
might be a while again.<br/>
