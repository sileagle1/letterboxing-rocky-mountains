signed into my email and almost fell out of me chair when the 'your <br>
box has been found' reports flooded the screen!  ARRRR!!!  It whar <br>
like Christmas mornin' on the poop deck!!<br>
<br>
Between the birthday boxer PRE and the visitin' Art trekker the local <br>
boxes have seen the sun more times than they have since y'all were <br>
here! <br>
<br>
They both report box number one of 'there were two guys' missing, so <br>
I'll be sailin' down thar today to check it out and get started on a <br>
new stamp if it's walked the plank.  But that means that neither of <br>
them know the first part of the joke!  I'll be tellin' them the first <br>
part.. for a DOLLAR!!  BWAR HAR HAR!!<br>
<br>
It was sure fun to see all the notes this morning.  Can't wait to <br>
hear trip reports!  I hear that PRE has a most excellent story to <br>
share on one of the Zebediah Gump boxes.  WOOT!<br>
<br>
Es, who wonders if the east coast boxers do a zippy jig when two <br>
boxers in one week visit their boxes<br>

and there are a bajillion e-mail 'status changes' on my computer, <br>
happy footed dance this morning. (say that 5 times fast!) AND that <br>
swift footed birthday boxer left a box nearby, whoowoo!<br>
<br>
Pre, you must be exhausted and your head must be spinning after all <br>
those new stamps! I got the Happy Birthday Box stamp recarved and <br>
replaced with a bonus stamp before you came, but couldn't get the <br>
box back online in time before you left, darn! You'll have to come <br>
back.<br>
<br>
Es, Easterners couldn't be as excited as we get, there is just no <br>
way they could appreciate it the way we do!!!!<br>

without Kenna or in 10 days when she gets home, doh)<br>
