That's the spirit!<br>
<br>
Now- my yearly plea for help:<br>
<br>
For those of you that joined this past year, Snowdown is a Cabin-<br>
Fever-Reliever in Durango, Colorado. There are LOTS of events <br>
including a parade and, my favorite, The Search For The Silver <br>
Bullet! And this year the theme is Jolly Roger Snowdown!!!<br>
<br>
http://www.snowdown.org/poster07.htm<br>
 (Yarrrr!) <br>
<br>
The search is a week-long treasure hunt where they announce five <br>
clues on the radio each day, starting Monday, and usually ending on <br>
Saturday when someone finds the prize. The clues are really <br>
hard...until the very end where they basically tell you where it is. <br>
So...if nobody minds, I'll post the clues each day when I get the <br>
time, and you folks can use your noggins to help me find the loot. It <br>
means $250 for me, and pride and prestige for the letterboxers who <br>
help me win this year! Plus, I'll post a picture of myself in my <br>
ridiculous pirate hat!<br>
<br>
Last year I was looking around on the disc golf course a half hour <br>
before the silver bullet was found under a fake rock that I must have <br>
walked right by. And the year before I was maybe two feet from the <br>
out house that the bullet was hidden in. All because of the help I <br>
got from RMLetterboxers. So, like JeLy says, this could be THE YEAR!<br>
<br>
If this is a little bit too much off topic for some of you, please e-<br>
mail me privately and I will find another venue to beg for help. <br>
Really, I don't want to bug anybody.<br>
<br>
Shiver me timbers!<br>

go) Arrr!  Since we've navigated ye to the near vicinity these past two <br>
years, this year ye must turn over every rock, empty every garbage can, <br>
stick ye hand down every commode in the vicinity until ye finds the <br>
treasure!<br>

year we'll organize a cheer section!<br>

Yarrr. I have my kevlar dumpster-diving gloves, my rock-turning <br>
spatula, and my out-house snorkel with me and ready to go. SO without <br>
further adieu.....the first batch of clues:<br>
<br>
1) Look at the aft of the map.<br>
<br>
2) From West Derby look towards New Mexico.<br>
<br>
3) I'm thinking of a number between 2 and nay, (neigh?).<br>
<br>
4) You won't need a shovel to dig for this treasure.<br>
<br>
I have a few ideas myself, but I would rather hear other possible ideas <br>
before I pollute your minds with what I've been thinking. <br>

Your winter carnival sounds a lot like Snowdown. We have belt sander <br>
drag races, feline fashion show, and downhill kayak races. But the <br>
bedsleds and human bowling sounds like more fun to me. (Hmmmm...we <br>
might have to steal a few ideas....)<br>

Okay, I'm throwing in what my Gray Brain cells came up with:<br>
<br>
The Durango Airport???  Let me explain:<br>
<br>
Derby comes up on Mapquest to the SE of Durango.  (I don't know if <br>
the rules state that it must be with the city limits).  If you start <br>
there and look towards New Mexico there is the Indian <br>
Reservation...a treasure that you don't need to dig for!?! Within <br>
the reservation, sits the airport with a street number ending <br>
in "A"...nay???  I think it was 305A.<br>
<br>
Well, maybe misdirection, I'm certainly famous for that!  <br>
<br>
What do you think, Y?<br>
<br>
Hugs, Dreadliest of Peaches<br>
