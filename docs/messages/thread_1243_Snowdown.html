Now- my yearly plea for help:<br/>
<br/>
For those of you that joined this past year, Snowdown is a Cabin-<br/>
Fever-Reliever in Durango, Colorado. There are LOTS of events <br/>
including a parade and, my favorite, The Search For The Silver <br/>
Bullet! And this year the theme is Jolly Roger Snowdown!!!<br/>
<br/>
http://www.snowdown.org/poster07.htm<br/>
 (Yarrrr!) <br/>
<br/>
The search is a week-long treasure hunt where they announce five <br/>
clues on the radio each day, starting Monday, and usually ending on <br/>
Saturday when someone finds the prize. The clues are really <br/>
hard...until the very end where they basically tell you where it is. <br/>
So...if nobody minds, I'll post the clues each day when I get the <br/>
time, and you folks can use your noggins to help me find the loot. It <br/>
means $250 for me, and pride and prestige for the letterboxers who <br/>
help me win this year! Plus, I'll post a picture of myself in my <br/>
ridiculous pirate hat!<br/>
<br/>
Last year I was looking around on the disc golf course a half hour <br/>
before the silver bullet was found under a fake rock that I must have <br/>
walked right by. And the year before I was maybe two feet from the <br/>
out house that the bullet was hidden in. All because of the help I <br/>
got from RMLetterboxers. So, like JeLy says, this could be THE YEAR!<br/>
<br/>
If this is a little bit too much off topic for some of you, please e-<br/>
mail me privately and I will find another venue to beg for help. <br/>
Really, I don't want to bug anybody.<br/>

Shiver me timbers!<br/>

          Bedsled Races! Human Bowling! Woot! How can you find anything funner <br/>
than that! I wish I'd known, Aljan, Cappy and I might have been up to <br/>
cheer on the Fire Dept!!! Let us know how your boys did! Maybe next <br/>
year we'll organize a cheer section!<br/>

&gt; Considering that Grand Lake's winter carnival (this weekend) fights <br/>
cabin fever with bedsled races, human bowling and teapot curling, I am <br/>
definetly up for something a bit more challenging. My boys from the <br/>
fire department dominate the bed sled races every year though, that's <br/>
always fun.<br/>

&gt; &gt; This is the year!  I feel it y!   <br/>
&gt; &gt; JeLyBean<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That's the spirit!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now- my yearly plea for help:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For those of you that joined this past year, Snowdown is a Cabin-<br/>
&gt; Fever-Reliever in Durango, Colorado. There are LOTS of events <br/>
&gt; including a parade and, my favorite, The Search For The Silver <br/>
&gt; Bullet! And this year the theme is Jolly Roger Snowdown!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://www.snowdown.org/poster07.htm<br/>
&gt;  (Yarrrr!) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The search is a week-long treasure hunt where they announce five <br/>
&gt; clues on the radio each day, starting Monday, and usually ending <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; Saturday when someone finds the prize. The clues are really <br/>
&gt; hard...until the very end where they basically tell you where it <br/>
is. <br/>
&gt; So...if nobody minds, I'll post the clues each day when I get the <br/>
&gt; time, and you folks can use your noggins to help me find the loot. <br/>
It <br/>
&gt; means $250 for me, and pride and prestige for the letterboxers who <br/>
&gt; help me win this year! Plus, I'll post a picture of myself in my <br/>
&gt; ridiculous pirate hat!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last year I was looking around on the disc golf course a half hour <br/>
&gt; before the silver bullet was found under a fake rock that I must <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; walked right by. And the year before I was maybe two feet from the <br/>
&gt; out house that the bullet was hidden in. All because of the help I <br/>
&gt; got from RMLetterboxers. So, like JeLy says, this could be THE <br/>
YEAR!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If this is a little bit too much off topic for some of you, please <br/>
e-<br/>
&gt; mail me privately and I will find another venue to beg for help. <br/>
&gt; Really, I don't want to bug anybody.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Shiver me timbers!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; y-nought<br/>

further adieu.....the first batch of clues:<br/>
<br/>
1) Look at the aft of the map.<br/>
<br/>
2) From West Derby look towards New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
3) I'm thinking of a number between 2 and nay, (neigh?).<br/>
<br/>
4) You won't need a shovel to dig for this treasure.<br/>
<br/>
I have a few ideas myself, but I would rather hear other possible ideas <br/>
before I pollute your minds with what I've been thinking. <br/>

Your winter carnival sounds a lot like Snowdown. We have belt sander <br/>
drag races, feline fashion show, and downhill kayak races. But the <br/>
bedsleds and human bowling sounds like more fun to me. (Hmmmm...we <br/>
might have to steal a few ideas....)<br/>

Okay, I'm throwing in what my Gray Brain cells came up with:<br/>
<br/>
The Durango Airport???  Let me explain:<br/>
<br/>
Derby comes up on Mapquest to the SE of Durango.  (I don't know if <br/>
the rules state that it must be with the city limits).  If you start <br/>
there and look towards New Mexico there is the Indian <br/>
Reservation...a treasure that you don't need to dig for!?! Within <br/>
the reservation, sits the airport with a street number ending <br/>
in "A"...nay???  I think it was 305A.<br/>
<br/>
Well, maybe misdirection, I'm certainly famous for that!  <br/>
<br/>
What do you think, Y?<br/>
