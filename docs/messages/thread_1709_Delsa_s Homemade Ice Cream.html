                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am a huge nostalgia junkie and loved the little ice cream shop on Ustick Road in Boise.  It had been a fixture in Boise since 1961 but closed its doors in 2007 as the new owners had filed bankruptcy.  Like so many I was heartbroken when it closed and looked like it was gone forever.  I am thrilled to share that it just re-opened.  I drive by every day on my way to work and have watched as they have been working on bringing the tiny restaurant back to life. We stopped by on their opening weekend for some ice cream and it was wonderful.  I have always loved their Mud Pie Ice Cream.  I felt like this little shop was begging for a box (how could I resist) so I just planted one today.<br/>
