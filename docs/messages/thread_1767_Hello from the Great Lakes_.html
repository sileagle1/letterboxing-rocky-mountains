<br/>
One Love Journeying here, from snowy Wisconsin. My partner (Lighthouse Keeper) and I are going to be taking a road trip out West to visit my sister in Denver. We are "Boxheads" to the core and are just as excited to grab new letterboxes on our trip as we are to actually visit family and friends! (Hmm... the pull of addiction!)<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I was wondering if anyone would be interested in getting together somewhere the evening of Saturday, January 16th. We would love to meet some of the local letterboxers!<br/>
<br/>
Hope your winter is treating you well and bringing you all lots of great letterboxing adventures!<br/>
