I checked this morning, and it seems that the Grinch has made off with <br>
my Merry Christmas letterbox.  Well, there were no eye witnesses, so I <br>
can't say it was DEFINITELY the Grinch, but I'm pretty sure.  I intent <br>
to replant the box, but it might be a little while until I can do it.<br>

On a happier note, Union Station has a fresh logbook, courtesy of pre, <br>
and is ready for more visitors.<br>

I bet you anything it was that Jack fellow.  He's been visiting Denver <br>
quite often lately and he certainly IS "Grinchy!"<br>

I hadn't thought of Jack, but now that you mention it, I'm sure that <br>
you're right.  He does enjoy ruining letterboxers' fun every chance he <br>
gets and he was recently seen in the vicinity of the Merry Christmas <br>
box.<br>
<br>
And BoxerLover47 made this lovely offer:<br>
<br>
"Hey, I got a new toy for my birthday - a coil binding machine - that <br>
makes really cool log books. And pre just sent me a bunch of PRE-cut <br>
pages. I'd be delighted to make you a replacement for your Merry <br>
Christmas box. Just give me an idea what you'd like and it's yours!"<br>
<br>
That's awfully nice!  I am still thinking about the size and shape of <br>
the container I plan to replant with - I had some unexpected problems <br>
with the old box, so I may use something different this time.  I will <br>
definitely be in touch about your generous offer.  And, by the way, <br>
what a great birthday present. :)<br>
