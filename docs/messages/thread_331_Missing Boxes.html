I wonder if it'd be worthwhile or effective to start placing some <br/>
kind of note in the box that says something like, "This box is <br/>
property of Letterboxing North America.  Deliberate removal or <br/>
destruction of this box may be subject to penalties."  Has little <br/>
teeth, I know, but might serve as a mild deterrant...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You know, after my first box went missing, I was truly upset for the <br/>
lost work, lost journal, lost fun for other, and many more reasons.  <br/>
After a few of these happenings, I had come to accept it.  Kinda <br/>
like the five stages of loss/trauma, you know, anger, bargaining, <br/>
acceptance...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I've since changed my philosophy about my letterboxes.  Once <br/>
I put a letterbox out there, I assume it's gone for good and really <br/>
no longer mine.  If I happen to be hiking in the same spot later, <br/>
I'll stop in and see if I was able to provide others with a little <br/>
fun.  If it's gone, there will be others, I intend to never stop <br/>
placing new boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I have had the improper hiding thing happen many times.  It must be  <br/>
people who let their kids re-assemble and rehide the box.  I have a <br/>
hard time believing an adult letterboxer would be so careless.  I <br/>
recently found my butterfly box with the contents just dumped in and <br/>
the baggies wadded up and stuffed in there.  I mean, if you're <br/>
putting everything back in, how hard is it to put them in the bags <br/>
first?  Had to be kids.  Right?<br/>
<br/>
What bothered me the most about Letchworth was the blatant theft.  <br/>
In the past, I had the luxury of not knowing why it went missing, so <br/>
I could assume maybe some nature lover decided to clean up  <br/>
some "litter" or an animal had dragged it away, or some such <br/>
fantasy.  But to have someone tell me specifically that a person had <br/>
not only stolen it but had shown it around to their co-workers, <br/>
proud of their act, that's just evil.  And now this person knows of <br/>
the LbNA site and could potentially hunt for and steal other boxes.  <br/>
It bothers me that we can really do nothing to stop a person like <br/>
this.<br/>

   In rock climbing there is a warning that is passed around to deter <br/>
theft. Extra climbing gear is often left at the bottom of a climb and <br/>
scoundrels can take it in plain view of the owner, but since they are <br/>
a few hundred feet up nothing can be done. So everyone says that <br/>
stolen gear will not catch you if you fall- even if you bought it <br/>
from the thief. Superstitious, I know, but some people just don't buy <br/>
used gear, and if they do they check out the karmic history.<br/>
<br/>
     So, writing a curse into the box may deter some.<br/>

It's worked for me so far.<br/>
<br/>
I would be heartbroken if someone took one of my boxes1  I guess they just have no idea how much of ourselves we put into them.  ...mean people suck.<br/>
