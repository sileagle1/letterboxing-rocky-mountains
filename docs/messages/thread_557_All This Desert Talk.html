Wow, all this desert talk is making me want to go boxing! I actually <br>
don't have the Negro Bill stamp yet....hmmm. All of a sudden work is <br>
frantically busy, town is busy, and I just got back in town on <br>
Monday from another California trip (found ten boxes there, <br>
yipppppie), and to top it off, a girlfriend in Cal. gave me a Nancy <br>
Drew Mystery computer game and I got sucked into working on it in <br>
the evenings! Focus, focus back on boxing. The Moab wildflowers are <br>
getting ready to do their thing, and the temp. today is about 70*. I <br>
thought of a new fun box while driving home and thought of a couple <br>
of fun places to hide it. Easy hike or harder hike, I never can <br>
decide! However, the four boxes on the Portal trail are very lonely <br>
and waiting for their first visitor.<br>
<br>
Where are you starting your Hatch Wash trip from, Y? How fun and the <br>
weather should be soooo nice. I love it down there! So much to <br>
explore in that region.<br>

I don't know exactly when, but I'll be giving those Portal boxes a <br>
visit soon. I've done that hike once before and I just loved it.<br>
<br>
I'm going into Hatch Wash from the Needles Overlook Road. Then <br>
cutting back northeast on a dirt road right before the campground. I <br>
found out about this access from a climbing guide. It said there are <br>
600 ft. walls on each side of the canyon with year round water <br>
flowing at the bottom. I also heard there are wild cattle in there, <br>
so we'll be purifying that water.<br>
<br>
I saw a couple of flower buds when I was over in Moab a few weeks <br>
ago. I'll bet they are spectacular this year with all the wet weather <br>
we've had.<br>
<br>
Happy Stamping,<br>
