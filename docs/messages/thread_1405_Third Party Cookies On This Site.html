                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey everyone, I have noticed over the last week or so I get a delay <br>
when navigating to or clicking on links on this RML talk list site.  <br>
During these delays, in the status bar at the bottom of my browswer, <br>
I see this message:<br>
<br>
Waiting for <br>
http://view.atdmt.com/DEN/rview/yhxxxcsa0040000169den/direct/01/?<br>
ti....<br>
<br>
I also get a "privacy" icon on the bottom of my browser, and when I <br>
click on it, I see that my browser is blocking cookies from this <br>
atdmt.com site.  When I read the privacy summary, I see a reference <br>
to a web site called Atlas Solutions, that provides "marketing <br>
solutions" by collecting information from the users of a web site.  <br>
Among the kinds of information it says it is collecting are the <br>
following:<br>
<br>
"Unique identifiers issued by a web site or service for the purpose <br>
of identifying an individual over time.<br>
<br>
"Information generated by the purchase of a product or service, <br>
including information about the method of payment."<br>
<br>
"Information about the computer system the individual is using to <br>
access the Internet, such as the IP number, domain name, browser type <br>
or operating system."<br>
<br>
"Information generated by browsing the web site such as which pages <br>
are visited, and how long an individual stays on each page."<br>
<br>
"Information generated from or reflecting explicit interactions with <br>
the web site, such as queries to a search engine or logs of account <br>
activity."<br>
<br>
"Mechanisms, such as HTTP cookies, for maintaining an active <br>
connection with an individual or for automatically identifying an <br>
individual who has visited a particular site or previously accessed <br>
particular content."<br>
<br>
"Data about an individual's likes and dislikes, such as favorite <br>
color or musical tastes."<br>
<br>
Now all of this sounds pretty invasive to me.  Does anyone know what <br>
this is about, and is anyone else getting delays from this site or <br>
noticing messages about atdmt.com in their browser status bar?<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
