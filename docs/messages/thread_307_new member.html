Glad to find some folks talking letterboxing in areas that I might <br/>
actually get to.  I was down on the front range earlier this summer <br/>
but didn't have time for LBing - darn.  Sounds like you've got some <br/>
fun ones going down there.  I did make a trip to SLC &amp; was able to <br/>
do some Utah &amp; Idaho boxes then.  And I see there are now some in <br/>
the Moab area that I'll look forward to nabbing when I head down <br/>
there to bike next spring.  Not much here in western Montana but <br/>
we're trying to change that.  <br/>
<br/>
I'd be interested in a discussion on creating clues.  So far the <br/>
boxes I've planted have been a mixture - a couple straightforward <br/>
drive-bys for those just passing through;  one long hike in an area <br/>
I enjoy but that I seriously doubt others will ever bother with; a <br/>
couple mystery boxes - one dead easy the other I think tougher <br/>
though I haven't had feedback on it yet; and several that are sort <br/>
of intermediate with clues gained by exploring signs in the area &amp; <br/>
that sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
How are people inspired to come up with creative clues?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Woohoo!  Greetings and welcome to Rocky Mountain Letterboxing! <br/>
<br/>
I did a series of boxes based on an old mountain man (Zebediah Gump) <br/>
and had lots of fun writing stories that included him in some real <br/>
history (remember Forest Gump?).  Once I research the <br/>
incident/person/location it's pretty easy to just create a story <br/>
about it that eventually has Zeb lead us to the spot. I've had some <br/>
really nice feedback from people about it, which makes it all the <br/>
more fun for me. Zeb may have some more chapters show up here one of <br/>
these days. <br/>
<br/>
I've also based one on a movie and put it in a location that fits <br/>
into the plot line...then written a story which included the movie's <br/>
characters with a 'new' adventure for them.  (Big Fish)<br/>
<br/>
Y-nought does a wonderful job of using clues, poems, cyphering and <br/>
stories. I'm not smart enough to write ones with puzzles, but they <br/>
sure are fun to solve! Or try to solve! (Cursed onion!!)<br/>
<br/>
Speaking for myself, I just love when the clues have something <br/>
besides the very basic directions. I don't really care so much if <br/>
they're by the side of the road or in a valley you have to climb to <br/>
<g> so much as I do about learning or seeing something new and <br/>
having a great adventure. <br/>

<br/>
I have done a mixture of styles, much like you have. My first was a <br/>
longish hike on one of my favorite trails. <br/>
Then I did one in town on a level path. <br/>
<br/>
Then a harder coded clue, mostly for people who live here (Durango <br/>
Colorado) and have the time to work it out. No newbies have surfaced <br/>
for that one yet, although it has been solved by a visiting pirate. <br/>
<br/>
After that I did a coded clue in Utah and thought I was done with <br/>
planting boxes. But, alas, I see other boxes or clues or a perfect <br/>
spot and I feel compelled to make another one. One thing I do <br/>
differently now (I have only been doing this a little over a year) is <br/>
I take a little longer to plant them. I look at them for a while and <br/>
get to know them before setting them free. And I will often change <br/>
them a few times before they go. It beats running out there to put in <br/>
a new logbook or stamp after they have been planted.<br/>
<br/>
Oops.... Now I'm rambling......<br/>

Esmeralda's boxes &amp; like her mountain man story.  Your boxes are up <br/>
next ynought.  I bet I'll get some ideas there too.<br/>
<br/>
Like Debbi I came to letterboxing from the carving side.  I really <br/>
enjoy makng the stamps but want the hunt to be fun too.  I've also <br/>
found that it helps to let ideas "mature" a bit.  I've been looking <br/>
at this one area as I've driven past this summer &amp; thinking it would <br/>
be a good spot.  As I drove by I'd mull what sort of stamp would be <br/>
appropriate.  Then just the other day as I passed yet again it hit <br/>
me - not one stamp - four.  It would really be a fun place for a <br/>
mini-series.  Now if I can just work out the clues <vbg><br/>
<br/>
Esmeralda, your clues mention not only hand made stamps but journals <br/>
too.  Would you care to elaborate - off list would be fine - as I'm <br/>
not likely to be down to CO to get a first hand look for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
Good boxing to all.<br/>
