Looks like I might be heading up to Idaho Springs this weekend to get <br>
away from it all with my hubby.  We're going to hike for Shining <br>
Star, and would love to get your microbox Bear in Paradise too, if <br>
you get the clues done.  We'll be staying at our favorite B&B in <br>
Idaho Springs overnight (Baxter's on the Creek ... shameless plug)<br>
<br>
If you don't get them posted, do you think you could email them to me <br>
so I can visit the box while we're up there?<br>
<br>
Best,<br>
Autumn<br>

I too would be interested in getting the Idaho Springs clues for this weekend.  I am driving to Grand Junction and may try to stop in Idaho Springs for awhile.  If they dont get posted I would love to get them emailed to me too.<br>
Thank you.<br>
