                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well ... Eric and I were in Idaho Springs, and I really wanted to go <br>
for this box.  We probably would have run into you on the trail, <br>
Ewok!!  Alas ... our breakfast was too yummy, and all my lazy husband <br>
wanted to do was go shopping.  :p<br>
<br>
Sensing my disappointment - we did stop at the Rock Crawler box to <br>
find that Dixie and Ron had once again made a first find ahead of <br>
us!  :)  Nifty and easy little microbox.  <br>
<br>
I too will be heading back up to Idaho Springs to get both Shining <br>
Star and Bear in Paradise.  I also had the thought to get Shining <br>
Star coming right off the trail from Bear in Paradise.  Hmm.  Perhaps <br>
a good trail map might help.  <br>
<br>
Anyway - while we didn't box in Idaho Springs, we did come up with a <br>
blissful idea for a series of boxes.  We will be carving a LOT this <br>
winter.  (we had snow up there yesterday!!)<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Autumn (and her lazy husband Eric)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We also were in Idaho Springs this weekend (only a drive thru on Friday night tho..on the way to Grand Junction).<br>
I went to look for Bear in Paradise and Shining Star.  I first checked on Bear in Paradise (I had never seen a microbox).<br>
What a beautiful area it is in...I hadnt been there in years.  It was getting dark so I didnt have time to find Shining Star.<br>
Had I read the clues before looking for Bear I may have tried for it...I think you are right Autumn that they are on the<br>
same trail...even tho the clues tell you to park at different places....  Will just have to go up again and spend more<br>
time....it really is a beautiful area.<br>

to find your box.  It's interesting that you can access Shining Star <br>
without the uphill/downhill climb!  But, I have to say I liked the <br>
climb because you have some gorgeous views at the top, so it was <br>
worth it to us, for those that don't mind a bit of a hike.  It's so <br>
beautiful there!  And yes Autumn, we were the first finders for the <br>
Rock Crawler box, it was our first micro box!<br>
