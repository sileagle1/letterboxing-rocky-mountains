Zebediah Gump - Doc Holiday.  At the bottom when you talk about the<br>
terrain and such (PS - I LOVE that you do this!!!!), it says:<br>
 <br>
Esmerelda says: This trail isn't suitable for wheelchairs and you'll<br>
need some strong legs and healthy lungs to get a stroller up there. It's<br>
not a long hike (about 45 minutes round trip), but quite steep and the<br>
trail is fairly rocky in spots. It is, however, dog friendly, and<br>
there's a wonderful view from the top. <br>
<br>
My kids can't do steep and rocky... the little one tends to lose his<br>
footing.  <br>
 <br>
Speaking of losing his footing, I have to tell you all about this... I<br>
went out to Deer Creek Canyon Park today to plant a stamp (no, the clues<br>
aren't posted yet, and won't be till at least Friday afternoon).  The<br>
trail we took was downhill and NARROW.  Ok, it narrow for a 2 & 3 year<br>
old.  You might have been able to get 2 hikers side by side, but it was<br>
much more confortable to go single file.  Anyway, I was determined to<br>
place this stamp (Jessica - 13 - carved this stamp back in May!).  I<br>
tell you, there were a few times I was sure Matthew or Maggie were going<br>
to go tumbling down the cliff.  Thankfully, they didn't and actually, in<br>
all reality, they did VERY well.  But, I think it is one of the "hardest<br>
trails" we have taken them on.<br>
 <br>
Oh, oh, and then we were off to another place to plant a stamp... some<br>
of the trails follow a river... WELL, while I am planting the stamp, I<br>
turn around to see Maggie and Matthew staning extremely close to the<br>
edge of the cliff looking down at the water!  <br>
 <br>
Now, keep in mind, I am very paranoid, so they probably were a good 2<br>
feet from the edge, but it was too close for me!<br>
 <br>
Needless to say, I am not so sure we will be picking places like that to<br>
plant stamps when it is just the 3 of us again.<br>

Which one can't you do with the kids? :::tries to think of it:::<br>
<br>
I had to run out and get my journal to count. I am F30 HH1 (I didn't <br>
count the two I found that didn't have stamps) and P...umm...16 I <br>
think. I have one almost ready to go to the Monster Mash that I'll <br>
place in Colorado when it returns, and a hitchhiker that will get <br>
shoosted off soon. Also a mystery box that I can hopefully place in <br>
the next week or so. I'm looking forward to getting the monster mash <br>
one back and seeing the journal full of east coast stamps!  I bet I <br>
won't get a Scotland, though!!<br>
<br>
I've been covering the state because that's the only way for me to <br>
find any boxes! :D  And it's fun for me to take some along to place <br>
as we go.  I really enjoy making them. <br>
