FLAG and the PIE?!  Well..  No wonder I love you guys!!  I'm printing <br/>
that one out!<br/>

Just for you, Es! We missed not having you and TDG there! That's okay, <br/>
we'll just have to do it again so that you can come see all of us!<br/>
<br/>
I wish we had been able to hit more boxes! But work beckons, and we <br/>
had to skeedattle on home. We did find Grizzly Creek in Glenwood <br/>
Springs on the way back tho - very nice spot. May have to encroach and <br/>
stick another one on that path. =3<br/>
<br/>
Again - it was just too much fun. There are lots of boxes back in Moab <br/>
still calling our name (oh no! Another trip! Whatever shall we do??) <br/>
and more wonderful people to meet. We should have one more meet before <br/>
the weather turns cold, and us boxers have to put away the backpack, <br/>
and start carving for the next season.<br/>
<br/>
Great pictures, Dixie! Thank you so much for sharing. We'll try and <br/>
stick some of ours up there as well.<br/>
