Good news after a little detective work by our very own A-Bear she has <br/>
confirmed for me that Blues Clues: Blue and Magenta at the Star <br/>
Library are both alive and well.  Originally we thought they were MIA <br/>
because the shelves had been rearranged but she located Blue this <br/>
morning and I have listed a new location for Magenta per A-Bear's book <br/>
coordinates from last week.  <br/>
<br/>
These are both fun boxes to locate with or without kids because they <br/>
are in the kids section of the library.  But they are also unique <br/>
because they are not in traditional Letterboxing containers.  Check <br/>
them out if you not been by to visit!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
