Hello,<br>
<br>
I learned about letterboxing on another online forum that I read, and <br>
it sounded like a lot of fun.  I have my logbook, stamp pad (still <br>
don't have a stamp yet), and some clues and I can't wait to get <br>
started.  Does anyone have any suggestions about which Denver-area <br>
boxes are good to begin with?<br>
<br>
I've read some of the old messages, and this looks like a fun group.<br>
<br>
Happy holidays!<br>

I think you'll find you like most of the letterboxes over there.  Just <br>
start on some that are close to you or in places you want to visit!<br>
<br>
Then come over to Grand Junction and do our's!  hehehe<br>

Es, passing Amy a piece of pie<br>

  Welcome Amy.<br>
   <br>
  There are a lot of nice boxes out there.  You'll make your way around, I'm sure.  Plenty of mountain boxes need stamps when the snow leaves us.  <br>
   <br>
  There's still a treat waiting with Fodor's new logbook too.<br>

Welcome!  I think you'll find that each and every box has it's own <br>
special reason for being there and worth discovering!!!  My only <br>
problem is, so many boxes...not enough time!!!  Like pie, I always want <br>
more!!!<br>
<br>
Have fun, Amy!  You don't know what fun you've gotten yourself into!!!  <br>

Hugs, Dread Peach<br>

Hi Amy~<br>
<br>
Let me add my "Welcome" to the others. This is a great group of<br>
wonderful people and any of the boxes you choose will be great fun. I<br>
2nd Es' suggestion on starting close to home and then spread out from<br>
there. As far as choosing a stamp, my suggestion would be to pick<br>
something you like; a trail name will come naturally.<br>

Thanks, everyone, for the warm welcomes!  I have been<br>
reading some clues for boxes in my area, and I can't<br>
wait to dig into the search.  When the weather warms<br>
up, I am definitely planning to head out to some of<br>
the mountain locations.<br>
<br>
I have ordered some stamp carving materials, so I may<br>
soon have some more questions for all of you.<br>
<br>
Happy holidays!<br>
Amy<br>

Another Denver letterboxer!  Welcome, welcome!  And as Aljan <br>
said "fresh meat!"  <br>
<br>
There are boxes in Denver proper by a few folks, with many I did.  I'm <br>
so pleased to know there's a new Denver boxer!  Just pick some boxes <br>
you like the sounds of and just get out there and box!<br>
<br>
I found Silent Doug's site to be super duper helpful when I was just <br>
starting out http://www.letterboxing.info/<br>
<br>
Did you know there is also a list specifically for new boxers?  <br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br>
<br>
I live in NW Denver myself and would happy to try and answer questions <br>
you have on this addicting hobby if I can.<br>
