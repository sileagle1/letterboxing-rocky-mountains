My letterbox "Litha" has been the bane of my planting existance.  It's "gone missing" many times by folks who just couldn't locate it.  It's been kindly relocated and had to be re-hidden several times.<br>
<br>
Today, this lovely geocacher found my poor box in quite a state, and graciously re-hid the box.  Sadly, I do not own a GPS system, so I have no way of finding my box with the coordinates he provided.  I am hopeful that someone on our lovely list who owns one of these fancy devices will locate my box and re-plant it at the appropriate place, or will provide me with some directions so that I can revise my clues accordingly.<br>
<br>
Help??<br>

Dear Autumn:<br>
I am a geocacher.  Today while hiking up on the Dakota Hogback east of Mathews-Winters Park I discovered the contents of your letterbox "LITHA" strewn over the east side of the ridge just south of the overlook near where the two power lines cross the Hogback.  I found the lower half of a plastic container, a logbook and pen in a plastic bag, a stamp and inkpad in another plastic bag, and an empty plastic bag.  the last entry in the logbook was on June 1, 2007 by a park ranger who monitors geocaches and letterboxes in these open spaces.  Judging by some of the log entries this letterbox has had previous trouble with inconsiderate hikers.  <br>
<br>
I found no data in the log that indicated where it had been hidden, so I packaged it up as best I could and placed it in a cavity on the east side of the rock wall  (towards the northern end of that wall) that surrounds the overlook area. It is concealed by a rock about the size of a football that now juts out a bit from the wall.  The coordinates are N39-41.6753/W105-12.0044  (13S 482846/4393880). <br>
<br>
If I can be of any further help you may contact me at the email address above.<br>

<br>
I do have a GPS and would be happy to try and find Lithia for you when I get<br>
a chance to get up there.  <br>
<br>
Most of my weekends are pretty booked.  I will let you know when I may have<br>
time.<br>
