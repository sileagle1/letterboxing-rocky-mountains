Welcome to letterboxing! =]<br>
 <br>
All of my boxes are kid friendly... we have a 21 month old and a 3 year<br>
old - both who INSIST they get to walk.... so, when we plant, we make<br>
them easy to get to.  <br>
 <br>
We are the Treasure Finders and you can find our 9 boxes on the main LB<br>
website.  (All are around Littleton, CO)<br>
 <br>
THere are also a few others in CO that we have found... Alchemists<br>
Lizard, Something Special for Eoghan!, Rock Crawler and Bear In<br>
Paradise, these were all boxes that the kids went with us.  Alchemists<br>
Lizard was a little long and the 21 month old ended up wanting to be<br>
carried for part of the trail (of course, I should mention, we went and<br>
did this one right after we found Something Special for Eoghan).<br>
 <br>
Hope that helps =]<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Carrie - I just snagged my first two letterboxes in Wyoming - <br>
they were really easy to get to, and the hikes were not more than <br>
1/2 mile in on nice, level trails.  Perfect for kids, I think.  The <br>
two boxes were called "Vedauwoo" and "Happy Jack", and clues to them <br>
can both be found at letterboxing.org on the Wyoming page.  I live <br>
in Fort Collins and I left at 9:30 am and got back around 3, stoping <br>
for lunch in Laramie on the way home.  There is a $5 entrance fee, <br>
but I think that will cover both places.  And dogs are allowed if <br>
they are on a leash.  Good luck and have fun - they are in really <br>
pretty places (especially Vedauwoo).<br>

is very easy, but probably no dogs allowed.  You could leave<br>
the dog in the car while finding the box and be back in<br>
less than 30 minutes, but the view will make you want to<br>
stay longer.<br>

<br>
Welcome - glad to have you here!<br>
<br>
All of the Treasure Finders boxes are good. Our Alchemist's Lizard <br>
can be a little long for young ones - but the terrain is very flat. <br>
The two at Chatfield State Park are good for younger kids. (All of <br>
these are in Littleton, Co, by the way). Our C letterbox in <br>
Golden/Lakewood is VERY easy to get to - on par with the Treasure <br>
Finders boxes. Dragon's Lair and Abert's squirrel in Bailey, Co are <br>
also very easy to get to.<br>
<br>
Most people will say in the clues whether or not a box is canine <br>
friendly or not, as well as how difficult the terrain is and how far. <br>
If it is unclear, an email to the placer usually provides the needed <br>
information.<br>
