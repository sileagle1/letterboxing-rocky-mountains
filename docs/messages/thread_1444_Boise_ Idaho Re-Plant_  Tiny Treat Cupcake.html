<br/>
Location:  664 South River Shore Lane, Suite 164, Eagle.  Off of <br/>
Eagle Road and River Shore Lane.<br/>
<br/>
The box can be found any time day or evening.  The cupcake shop is <br/>
open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
The cutest little cupcake shop is in Eagle, Idaho. Welcome to Lilly <br/>
Jane's Cupcakes.  Each cupcake is baked from scratch daily, using <br/>
only the finest ingredients such as sweetcream butter, rich <br/>
Madagascar Bourbon vanilla and a variety of specialty chocolates.<br/>
<br/>
Park in the parking lot in front of Lilly Jane's Cupcakes.  Walk in-<br/>
between Cold Stone Creamery and Windermere Real Estate towards the <br/>
fountain in the center of the complex.  Take the short path to your <br/>
right.  On your left you will see four large evergreen trees.  <br/>
Your "Tiny Treat" is hidden behind the back of the last tree (closest <br/>
to Eagle Road) under leaves and three river rocks.  Please re-hide <br/>
carefully as this is a busy complex.  Make sure to visit Lilly Jane's <br/>
and have a tiny treat!<br/>
<br/>
Should you note the box missing, it's contents in bad repair or if <br/>
you just want to say "Sweet Tooth " please contact me at <br/>
