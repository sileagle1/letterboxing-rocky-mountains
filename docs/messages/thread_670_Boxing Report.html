Hi all,<br/>
Went boxing the w/e of Apr 16-17 and found the following:<br/>
Grizzley Creek (in Glenwood Canyon)-actually I just went to the<br/>
pool for the day and had to make 1 lb stop on the way.  What<br/>
a beautiful detour on the way to the pool.  Saw a lot of stamps from<br/>
people returning from the Box on the rocks.  As usual a beautiful stamp <br/>
and logbook from our local pirate.<br/>
On the 17th I found Hikers Boot in Roxborough.  You all need to go <br/>
there-it is very lonely/only a few stamps in it.  Its a beautiful hike.<br/>
Also found Super uno guy and Nocturnal Scorpion.<br/>
And I left a little surprise somewhere!<br/>
<br/>
This Sat (weather permitting) Puppy Paws and I plan on a mega box day<br/>
in the Springs.<br/>
<br/>
