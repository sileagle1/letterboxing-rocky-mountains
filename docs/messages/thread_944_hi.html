When you say S. Idaho, what do you mean, eastern or western?  If you are in<br>
the east, I will be beyond tickled.  Everyone but Mother Hen is in the west,<br>
and she isn't active with the groups or meeting other boxers.  I'm here in<br>
Idaho Falls.<br>
<br>
Welcome to our humble little group and our crazy little hobby--I don't<br>
expect you are getting much done this week.  Brrrrrrrrr---  You will love it<br>
when it's warmer though.  Letterboxing is really great!  It has been such a<br>
fun thing for me.  I only wish I had more time to do it!<br>
