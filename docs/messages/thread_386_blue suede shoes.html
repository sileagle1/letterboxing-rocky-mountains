a neat find.  It was getting pretty late and we were happy to find that it<br/>
can be a "night time letterbox"  It was a great way to end a busy day.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday we went to the Bow Wow in Fort collins and that was also fun.  Very<br/>
crowded.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the afternoon we tried to find the blue suede shoes and we think<br/>
that it must be missing.  I hope not.  If we are right it was hidden in an<br/>
odd spot that could have been found and taken.<br/>
