                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recently joined the group and wanted to say hi. We were introduced <br>
to letterboxing by a fantastic article in "Family Fun", a magazine <br>
for <br>
families with kids ages 2-15. It was written by an American family <br>
living in Dartmoor. I'd heard of geocaching before, but was not <br>
attracted to it just because using a GPS is not that interesting to <br>
my <br>
small children. Letterboxing is right up our alley :-)<br>
<br>
We were hooked on the first find - the All American Series in <br>
Greeley. <br>
<br>
There was an article in the Denver Post yesterday about the <br>
ecological <br>
damage and "littering" (that would be the box) caused by geocaching. <br>
I <br>
was sorry to see it, because from what I can tell, letterboxers and <br>
geocachers are more careful with their surroundings than the average <br>
camper.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the work that so many of you are putting into this <br>
hobby. It makes me believe in the goodness of humanity again :-)<br>

There are so many lovely boxes on your side of the mountains!  But <br>
if you come over here boxing sometime, I have pie!<br>
