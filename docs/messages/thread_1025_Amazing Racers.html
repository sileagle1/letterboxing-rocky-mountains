                    <div class="plaintext-content">ES!  You are so funny!  And Aljan, how you make me smile with your <br/>
added support!  Peach and Cappy actually have talked about how much <br/>
fun it would be!  We are big fans of the show and when we saw it <br/>
took off from Red Rocks, we were bummed because had we known, we <br/>
live 10 minutes from there and could have watched for those Mercedes <br/>
and maybe "pirated" one of the cars and switched places with one of <br/>
the couples!  Aaarrr!  What fun that would be! And the "plunder" at <br/>
the end would be worth the trip!  Yo-ho!  Yo-ho!  Maybe sometime we <br/>
will surprise you all and get a spot as the "wise elders" on the <br/>
race! <br/>
<br/>
Dread Peach and Cappy....who just returned with plunder from a nice <br/>
day of b.d. letterboxing!  It's so great to live in Colorado!<br/>

&gt; I know it's way off topic.. but do any of y'all watch Amazing <br/>
Race?  <br/>
&gt; And if so did you see it start at Red Rocks?!  And go into the <br/>
airport <br/>
&gt; where I was working and didn't see a thing in Denver?!  AND that <br/>
one of <br/>
&gt; the teams is from Littleton?!<br/>
