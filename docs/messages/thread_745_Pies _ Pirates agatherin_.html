it!!!!!! I'll have to wait till the last minute and maybe sneak over <br/>
for the day? (How long would the drive be from Moab?) Meeting up with <br/>
everyone would make it all worth it! I have to run out to California <br/>
possibly for the next few weeks (that parenting thing), but I should <br/>
be back by then! Then it will all depend on work schedules, because I <br/>
don't dare ask for any more time off this summer!<br/>
