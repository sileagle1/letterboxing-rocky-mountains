back, I plan to hide them here in CO.  I really want everyone who gets<br>
those boxes to see the stamps from back east, BUT I don't want to put<br>
them in the box in case the box gets waterlogged, damaged or lost.  What<br>
if I was to scan the stamps and put that paper in the lb and keep the<br>
original log book at home?  Would that be wrong?<br>
 <br>
Please be kind and don't throw the flames too hard! =]<br>
 <br>
PS - sorry for so many emails all at once.  I am done now - at least for<br>
a while =]<br>
