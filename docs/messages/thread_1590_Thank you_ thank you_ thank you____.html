                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, we are just blown away after the last frantic four days of <br/>
boxing.  You guys are absolutely incredible...the stamps are <br/>
amazing, the logs are very creative and we are inspired to put more <br/>
into our boxes for others.  We have been to the most fantastic <br/>
places in Colorado...this activity has taken our family to places we <br/>
would never have encountered had it not been for your creativity and <br/>
desire to lure others.  We continually shake our heads in amazement <br/>
of how enriched and blessed we are as a family.  Thank you all for <br/>
taking the time to create the stamps, for putting together the logs <br/>
and boxes and for finding such interesting locations to bring us <br/>
to.  We are planning on return trips to vacation in several <br/>
locations that we've seen...  I'm beginning to think that this is <br/>
not really a hobby or activity, it's a way of life.  A commitment to <br/>
art and entertainment for someone you may never meet...and <br/>
opportunity to share your talent for an unheard accolade.  The time <br/>
that you all put into even finding these locations and then planting <br/>
and maintenance is inspiring.<br/>
<br/>
FYI - we had several high notes this weekend...our 200th box, solved <br/>
a Jely mystery, completed Lariat Loop and started on Talking Iron <br/>
(phew - I'm whomped).<br/>
<br/>
Couple of questions: 1) Why do pirates have such a pension for high <br/>
places on land?   2) Shurtugal wants to know if sitting on a cactus <br/>
while opening a box is enough to earn him a letterboxing purple <br/>
heart?<br/>
<br/>
I need ADVIL...<br/>
BoxTOPS, who's exhausted and needs a vacation from her vacation....<br/>
<br/>
P.S. We have a new family trailname: sporaddicts (Boxtops, Celtic <br/>
Sojourner, Dolphin Rider and Shurtugal)<br/>
