<br>
Actually... I think it might be the fact that winter hasn't set in that <br>
is keeping at least some of us quiet.  Personally, I've been taking <br>
advantage of the sunshine and the week off from school to do some <br>
boxing.  Don't worry, though - the nice weather has not made me forget <br>
about my Christmas box, which will be making its appearance very soon.<br>

few places we can find the camo Duck Tape is Wal-Mart.  It seems some stores<br>
stock it in the paint department with other colored tapes.  However in my<br>
area it is only carried seasonally and is found in the hunting/fishing area.<br>
I just stock up in the fall so I have enough to last most of the year.<br>
<br>
I like the Duck Tape because it tears easily, conforms to container shapes<br>
well and isn't too shiny.  It's also relatively inexpensive.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Liz...I've seen quite a few cammo bags lately...they seem to weather fine, of course, it is dependant on the finder ensuring they zip the bag closed properly.  So there's a little more risk with a cammo bag then, say, a lock-n-lock...just my opinion.<br>
