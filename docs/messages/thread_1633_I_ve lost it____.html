Actually... I think it might be the fact that winter hasn't set in that <br/>
is keeping at least some of us quiet.  Personally, I've been taking <br/>
advantage of the sunshine and the week off from school to do some <br/>
boxing.  Don't worry, though - the nice weather has not made me forget <br/>
about my Christmas box, which will be making its appearance very soon.<br/>

few places we can find the camo Duck Tape is Wal-Mart.  It seems some stores<br/>
stock it in the paint department with other colored tapes.  However in my<br/>
area it is only carried seasonally and is found in the hunting/fishing area.<br/>
I just stock up in the fall so I have enough to last most of the year.<br/>
<br/>
I like the Duck Tape because it tears easily, conforms to container shapes<br/>
well and isn't too shiny.  It's also relatively inexpensive.<br/>

So there's a little more risk with a cammo bag then, say, a lock-n-lock...just my opinion.<br/>
