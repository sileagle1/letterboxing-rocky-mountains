Here are four more clues. Sadly, I think they muddy the waters rather <br>
than clear anything up.<br>
<br>
7. Kroeger's Ace Hardware is under it. ( ??? name of the local <br>
hardware store)<br>
<br>
8.There's always something happening and it's usually quite loud. <br>
(Maybe another Hospital reference, or possibly the bandshell at the <br>
park by the underpass)<br>
<br>
9.Pink elephants on parade. (????what the????) <br>
<br>
10.The Albuquerque Fox. (possibly referring to Kasa Fox Channel 2 <br>
from Albuquerque that we get around here)<br>
<br>
I see a trend in the clues referring to something up in the air. <br>
What's up in the four corners, hardware under it. I wonder if it <br>
might be an antenna or something.<br>
<br>
I might get up early and go snoop around the hatchery/hospital area.<br>
<br>
If anyone has any more ideas toss 'em out. One of the prizes is 50 <br>
dollars to spend at Kat's Giant Burgers and Frozen Custard, my <br>
favorite new place in town. And I'm perfectly willing to share.<br>

Pink Elephants on Parade is a segment of Disney's Dumbo movie (1941).  It<br>
is also an alcoholic drink, which might be inspired by the movie.  What<br>
about a bar?<br>

Good Luck!<br>

Not a lot to add today, except:<br>
<br>
Clue #7: a hardware store could also be "under" things like, new <br>
management, renovations, bankruptcy protection, etc.  Could also <br>
refer to a Krogers ad that is underneath another ad in some <br>
publication, (such as Inside/Outside?)<br>
<br>
Clue #8: these are lyrics from a song called Our House by a band <br>
called Madness. (complete lyrics at <br>
