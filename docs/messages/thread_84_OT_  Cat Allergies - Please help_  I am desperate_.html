                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have had allergies to cats for as long as I can remember... but, I<br/>
have always dealt with them because I LOVE my cats... I have 3 (Bonkers<br/>
- 16; Stormy - 13; &amp; Cow - 7).  I got married in 1999 to a man who is<br/>
very allergic to cats and has asthma.  Since we were married, I have<br/>
kept the cats out of the main living area for his health. He never asked<br/>
me to do this... I did it because I hated seeing him rely so heavily on<br/>
his inhaler.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, here is the issue.  The cats current home is our basement.  Next<br/>
week we start remodeling our basement... to make it a living area (we<br/>
need the space as our family has grown since we bought the house).  This<br/>
means there is no place for the cats.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My mom has agreed to take my cats and is coming to get them next weekend<br/>
to take them to her house in CA (I live in CO).  I am having a real hard<br/>
time dealing with this and it is killing me to give up my cats.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everything I read says it is GOOD for Matthew (my 1 year old son who has<br/>
all the beginning signs of asthma) to be around the cats... it helps<br/>
build his immunity to being allergic... this is the "new" theory since<br/>
2001.  However, every article that I have found about adults w/ asthma<br/>
(and an allergy to cats) says that they should NOT be around cats...<br/>
that they are 50% more likely to end up in the hospital w/ a major<br/>
asthma attack.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sooooo - I am in the process of trying making Stormy non-allergenic...<br/>
LOL  I am wiping him down with a cleaner per the directions to help w/<br/>
dander control... I am brushing him daily to help w/ shedding and also<br/>
TRYING to give him anti-shedding pills (He doesn't like them).  I talked<br/>
to the vet tech last night who said there is also a proven drug (it's a<br/>
tranquilizer that is diluted 100 times) that will change the ph in the<br/>
saliva so that it is also non-allergenic.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
However, I know Michael's other concerns are the mess and smell of the<br/>
cats... I suggested putting the litter box in the unfinished area of the<br/>
basement with a cat door in the wall... this would keep the litter and<br/>
most of the smell inside the unfinished area... but, he is still<br/>
concerned about hairballs ( Stormy is notorious for  throwing up all the<br/>
time - hairballs or not) and that will stain/ruin the new carpet.  And,<br/>
Stormy is also a scooter... his anal glands don't empty correctly when<br/>
he has bowl movements, so to help the irritation, he scoots his bottom<br/>
on the floor - this streaks carpet. (Sorry, I am sure that is more than<br/>
you wanted to know! LOL)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know I can't keep all 3 cats... but, I am really having a hard time<br/>
with the idea of giving up Stormy.  Of course, every time I bring this<br/>
up, Michael changes the subject.  I understand it is a medical issue<br/>
with him and that his health has to come first (of course, his mother is<br/>
NO help... she keeps reminding him how an asthma attack could kill<br/>
him)... but this is still just killing me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So - here is what I am asking of all of you.  Can anyone here recommend<br/>
a PROVEN way to make Stormy non-allergenic and stop his throwing up and<br/>
scooting???  Money is really tight, so I am on a very strict budget...<br/>
but, I want to keep my babies!  Any suggestions, help, etc would be very<br/>
much appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS - my cats are indoor animals - they do not go outside and I refuse to<br/>
make them outdoor cats (we have bears and foxes that come down at<br/>
night).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all in advance for your suggestions and help.<br/>
