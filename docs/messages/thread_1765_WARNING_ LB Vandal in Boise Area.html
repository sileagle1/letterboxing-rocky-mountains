&gt; Thank you for the support of my locally murdered letterboxes. I have<br/>
&gt; completed my investigation tonight and have posted my conclusions on my LB<br/>
&gt; blog: http://lbwithblackvelvetrav.blogspot.com<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I did check two other boxes that are mere blocks from these two and they<br/>
&gt; were still alive and well. But it makes you wonder how long it will be<br/>
&gt; before this person strikes again and/or if they have already and I am<br/>
&gt; unaware of which ones have been targeted. It makes your mind race!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; WOM boxes migth be a lot of work but if more are murdered I may not have a<br/>
&gt; choice. What a pain in my pa-tootie! And worst of all is they took my good<br/>
&gt; carvings that were new. At least if they are going to murder my boxes they<br/>
&gt; could pick the old ones with my carvings that sucked!<br/>
