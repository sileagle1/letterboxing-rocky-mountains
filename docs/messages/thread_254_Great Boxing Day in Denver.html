Harry's Heaven ... found - in great shape<br>
Twenty Mile ... found - also in great shape<br>
Cool locations both of those, and beautiful stamps!!!<br>
<br>
Nocturnal Scorpion - found - box was soaking and full of mud, but <br>
contents were fine in their ziplock bags ...<br>
The Sea Goat - found - great location<br>
Dual Mindedness - found - fantastic clues.  contents were not in a <br>
ziplock and the entire inside was wet.  Most of the stamps in this <br>
box were waterlogged.  I added a ziplock to the microbox, and <br>
hopefully that will protect the logbook going forward.<br>
All three of these boxes in Debbi's series have amazing stamps .. :)<br>
<br>
Thanks for noticin' me ... gound - great location.<br>

Great boxing day,<br>

I just saw your post.  Thank you so much for the update!  And for adding<br>
a baggie to Dual Mindedness.  At the time I put the box out, I was out<br>
of small baggies - the ones I had just would not fit =]  Oh, and thank<br>
you for the compliment on the stamps =]  I love to carve - I just wish I<br>
had time to place all of them!  I have about 10 sitting here waiting to<br>
be planted.... Anyone interested in planting them for me? =]<br>
