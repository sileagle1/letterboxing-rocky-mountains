Found five boxes today - would have done more, but the light was <br/>
fading, and so was my husband.  hehehe :) Found all of these in great <br/>
shape:<br/>

Turtle's Can't Fly<br/>
The Master's Vision<br/>
Something Special for Eoghan<br/>
The Alchemist's Lizard<br/>

Thanks to everyone for planting.  <br/>
Beautiful stamps - Ravenwolf, your carving is ... astounding.<br/>

Best wishes,<br/>

Awwww.. Thanks, Autumn! *Blushes* I tend to get a little nuts when it <br/>
comes to stuff like that. <br/>
<br/>
And just to add to the carving discussion, I also use the speedball <br/>
cutters, and find them to be pretty good. But I sympathize with all <br/>
of you out there. I have gone out and bought brand new tips that <br/>
aren't sharp. Especially the little tiny #1's. I haven't seen any of <br/>
the master carve ones. Does anyone know where you can get them? I'll <br/>
poke around Guirey's. Maybe Meineger - but then you'll pay a <br/>
bucketload! Meineger is cool - but none too cheap!<br/>
<br/>
*sigh* we wanted to get out this weekend, but a bathroom remodel kept <br/>
us in the house. Glad both of those boxes looked good - thanks for <br/>
the note!<br/>

I saw the Mastercarve set in Hobby Lobby this morning.  It was in <br/>
Grand Junction but I'd guess that they are standard in all the <br/>
stores.  They were in the art section with the linoleum carving <br/>
stuff.  $20.00. <br/>
