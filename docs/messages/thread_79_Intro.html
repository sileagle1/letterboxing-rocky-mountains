Welcome.  I am new to this also (started less than 2 weeks ago.)  Ive only done a few so far.  The 2 in Chatfield were my first and are good for kids....1 year old if in backpack/no strollers.  But the walk is flat and not too long (I think it says less than a mile for both boxes).  <br/>
They are Beltane and Ostara.<br/>
The Fountain Valley one in Roxborough is not as flat but not too far if you go there and back (I dont know about the whole loop as I didnt take it).  There is some uphill but not too much/no strollers either.<br/>
<br/>
Also both will be close to youin Littleton.<br/>
I am in Highlands Ranch.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You have it all wrong, PRE - there's no clique with the Big Brain <br/>
Box.  There are 10 (or maybe 9) mini CDs floating around out there <br/>
in other people's letterboxes, kind of like a HH or Cuckoo Clues.  <br/>
If you happen to find one, you find one.  If not - it's probably <br/>
just as well, given the grief those disks seem to have brought to <br/>
the finders so far.  Once people find them, they can do what they <br/>
want with them, put them back into another box, give them to a <br/>
friend, smash them with a hammer, throw them into an incinerator, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I will admit to a little preferential treatment... that being <br/>
my preference for myself. :o)  I do sometimes do favors for people <br/>
who do favors for me.  I think I have been pretty open about that.  <br/>
I will always trade extra hints, hitchhikers, unpublished clues, <br/>
etc. for those who will do the same for me.  As Matron Mama Morton <br/>
says, when you're good to JeLy, JeLy's good to you.<br/>

I'm like, "what are you talking about???"!  I'm clueless! PRE, <br/>
you've left much to be MISinterpreted!!!  But, here's my EXACT <br/>
response:<br/>
<br/>
I do like coffee, cafe aulait for me!  Pumpkin spice latte is very <br/>
delicious and seasonal!<br/>
<br/>
Clique-y Madness???  I admit to being "Mad" about boxing...I do <br/>
things I wouldn't dream of except for the thrill of the hunt!  <br/>
<br/>
This group is the BEST! But, hey, "I get that"!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Hugs, Dreadly Peach...who is confused to all get out by <br/>
this "twisted knickers" talk!  Help me Mr. Wizard!<br/>
