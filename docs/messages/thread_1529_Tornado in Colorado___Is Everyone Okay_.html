Don't think Ramdelt had been on the boards much lately.  The Denver <br/>

For a nice letterboxing clue, the tornado headed straight over the Stanley Manor Murder Mystery box #1 and headed northwest over the location of "The Locomotion".  The Locomotion was pulled at the time, however I do not have a status of the Stanley Manor box.  The homes that were most effected by the tornado are those standing between those two locations.<br/>

Thank you all for your concern. I was very worried yesterday during the tornado because I could not get a hold of my family but everyone is safe. We were without power until last night, which is great compared to the rest of town. Comcast recently came back up around noon today but we still don't have any phone service. The only damage to our home is due to hail but is minimal compared to what the folks on the other end of town. If you have never been to Windsor, it's not a huge town and is only about 15 blocks wide. The tornado took out a lot of homes between 1st and 7th. Luckily we sit around 11th and the house is till standing. I drove to the other end ot town this morning and can't describe how bad things look. <br/>

Thanks for the update, Scott.  I'm glad to hear all is OK, hope things<br/>
are back to normal and the town recovers soon.  Being originally from<br/>
Oklahoma, I understand the devastation a tornado can cause. Happy you<br/>
were one of the lucky ones!<br/>

your Murder Mystery boxes.  Stanley had a chapter to the story that you <br/>
didn't even know about!  I think you need to add a box to your series <br/>
involving the recent events in the story...."it was a dark and stormy <br/>
night" kind of a thing!  <br/>
<br/>
Well, your family has certainly been put through a major stress test. <br/>
Glad to hear that you're all safe and all were tucked a few blocks <br/>
away.  It's so sad because Windsor is an absolutely beautiful area.  <br/>
Something tells me that this storm will not get the best of <br/>
Windsorites!  <br/>
