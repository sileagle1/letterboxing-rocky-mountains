The Jolly G-Man also had one there, though I don't know if has been <br/>
removed or not.  Maybe you can let us know if it is still there:<br/>

We missed your Hiker's Boot by a week.  We were there seeking <br/>
Fountain Valley and hiking Carpenter's Peak on 09/03.  Hiker's Boot <br/>
and Foot Loose are on our list for our next visit.  DrewClan hipped <br/>
us to the Jolly G-Man after we reported Fountain Valley found and in <br/>
good condition.<br/>

Theres some good rocks at the top to hide it.  When we crested at the top an eagle flew out of some rocky area a few feet from us.  It was awsome.<br/>

  You know, I almost put Hiker's Boot on Carpenter's Peak.  I could put <br/>
  another one up there.  Maybe it would be a better spot than South Rim.  Then <br/>
  we would have more at Roxborough.  What do you think?<br/>

To be honest, I've only hiked Carpenter's Peak twice.  It took me 8 <br/>
years after the first time to even consider doing it again.  Don't <br/>
get me wrong, I think the payoff is outstanding, but I just didn't <br/>
enjoy the hike all that much either time.  Maybe its just me.  So, <br/>
if you were to hide a box up there, I agree that there are a lot of <br/>
hiding spots but there would be limited traffic and I probably <br/>
wouldn't be stamping in until about 2012 (my son will be driving by <br/>
then - yikes!).<br/>
<br/>
My goal in placing boxes has been to try to find places that seekers <br/>
might not otherwise go.  That way, they're not only finding the box, <br/>
but finding a new trail or park, as well.  In that sense, <br/>
Carpenter's Peak might be a great place, but I think any place in <br/>
Roxborough that will bring people to this hidden gem of a park would <br/>
be worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion...<br/>

  Think I will just go ahead a place a little microbox up there.  I will <br/>
just put in a small stamp and a small tablet of paper.  Is this all I do for <br/>
microboxes?  If nobody goes to it after quite a while, I will just remove <br/>
it.   I went on South Rim last week after the rain and I saw a very large <br/>
