In a terrible coincidence the same thing happened to my nephew and <br/>
neice in Portland, Oregon. They had just started 'boxing and had <br/>
found a few stamps including a couple by Der Mad Stamper. They were <br/>
going to show me last time they visited, but their logbook and <br/>
stamps were stolen from their car. ?????? They figured that the <br/>
small box looked like it contained "valuables" to a theif....who <br/>
probably threw them away as soon as he opened it.<br/>
<br/>
So spread the voodoo around, Aljan.<br/>

&gt; OK - now THAT totally sucks!  Grrrr...  pets the precious voodoo <br/>
doll meant for those who take things that don't belong to them.  I <br/>
have some extra copies of Fodor hanging around.  If you will get me <br/>
your mailing address I will get you taken care of.  <br/>

&gt;   Aljan, that is too weird!  Other bummer news...my son's car was <br/>
&gt; broken into and they stole his and his girlfriends journals and <br/>
&gt; personal stamps!  In her journal was the First Finder for Fodor!  <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; was extra bummed because it was our FF for one of your boxes and <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; was such an AWESOME FF keepsake!  Fodor maybe isn't too happy with <br/>
&gt; all of us!  But, I took a photo of it and I'm going to print it <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; her new journal!  Not as cool as the original, but better than <br/>
&gt; none!  If anyone comes across journals tossed somewhere for <br/>
&gt; Robothouse or Miss Chickie, let me know!  They just got started <br/>
&gt; boxing and had to pull RED because of the crazies there and then <br/>
&gt; they get robbed of their journals and stamps! Aaarrrr!!!<br/>
