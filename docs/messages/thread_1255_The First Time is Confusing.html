                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, Peach, the chicken at Cuckoo's has some really buggy eyes <br>
and I thought that was the "you are being watched" clue across from <br>
the Ore House.<br>
<br>
I will check the clock tower at the Park, I seem to recall that it <br>
doesn't work anymore. So it's perfectly correct only twice each day <br>
and is therefore confusing.<br>
<br>
There is a playground at the park too and I'll be checking it for T-<br>
Ball type stuff this afternoon. As well as numbers on the <br>
train/horses/building/street signs.......<br>
<br>
Also:<br>
<br>
13) Soggy Yogi.<br>
<br>
I'll be looking for a bear or a Hindu or something, too.<br>
<br>
Oooh, I hope I'm not, like, a couple of miles off (it's happened <br>
before).<br>
<br>
Anyway, I get off work early because I came in early. I need to go to <br>
one of the sponsor stores for a bonus clue and get the next one at <br>
3:45. Hopefully, I'll have some exciting news after that.<br>
