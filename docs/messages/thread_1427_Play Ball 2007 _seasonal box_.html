Ok guys. A few of you have asked about this box given the recent <br>
developments of the Rockies making the playoffs.<br>
<br>
Who knew?! I certainly didn't when I postd a month ago about <br>
pulling this box for the season today, 10/14. <br>
<br>
To be honest, it's only 'cause I'm holding out for Rox vs. Sox on <br>
Fox (In A Box next year if this miracle happens!) ...oh and the fact <br>
that's it's raining and miserable here in Denver today and my heat <br>
came on for the first time this morning, that I'll leave this year's <br>
Play Ball! available because I can't be bothered to go pull it. <br>
<br>
So....Until the World Series is over...no matter who wins, this box <br>
will remain available, this year only. Given the NEVER Give Up Hope <br>
gene on my maternal side of the family I have to say: GO RED SOX!<br>
<br>
I suspect the logbook is or nearly is full. Anyone still wanting to <br>
stamp in will have to make due.<br>
<br>
pre<br>
Who wonders how she's gonna make it through this week staying up <br>
soooo late watching baseball...2 games at once even :-) <br>
