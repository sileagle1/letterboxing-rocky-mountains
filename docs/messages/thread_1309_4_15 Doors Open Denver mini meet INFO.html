                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok everyone, as promised, here's the info for our mini DOD informal <br/>
gathering and urban exploring opportunity on Sunday, April 15th<br/>
<br/>
Timing is everything!  TODAY  April 6th  in BOTH the Denver Post <br/>
AND Rocky Mountain News you'll find a copy of the pull out guide for <br/>
Doors Open Denver.  Run out and get your copy NOW!  <br/>
<br/>
This will give you a chance to read up and plan which buildings you'd <br/>
like to explore/work in with nearby letterboxes/and so on.  Then, <br/>
after everyone arrives, we do some exchanges, chat, etc we can <br/>
(hopefully) arrange ourselves into groups with people who want to see <br/>
similar DOD places/parts of town/'boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I'll try and stop by and get extra copies of the guide this week to <br/>
hand out on the 15th, but please do try and get your own copy TODAY!<br/>
<br/>
Most DOD locations are only open until about 4 pm, so in order to <br/>
allow plenty of time to do exchanges, letterbox, and still have most <br/>
of the afternoon for DOD exploring, here's the plan:<br/>
<br/>
We'll meet:<br/>
Sunday, April 15th  - 10:30 am<br/>
Indoor meeting place.   You never know about the weather!<br/>
Common Grounds Coffeehouse<br/>
1601 17th St, Denver, 80202<br/>
303) 296-9248<br/>
Some more info: http://tinyurl.com/22h6oy<br/>
<br/>
I'll be the blonde (female) wearing the explorer's hat.<br/>
<br/>
I'll try to get there about 10 a.m. and attempt to stake out a table <br/>
large enough for our group.  Based on posts here and previous emails <br/>
I'm thinking we may have 10-15 people and would like to confirm <br/>
this...sooooo<br/>
<br/>
CAN WE GET A HEAD COUNT? Please post here not later than 8 pm FRIDAY, <br/>
April 13th with the following info:<br/>
<br/>
1)Yes, we're still planning on coming!<br/>
<br/>
2)X number of people will be in our party and our trail names <br/>
are ?????? <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone say: Personal Travelers? <winks>  I of course will be <br/>
there!<br/>
<br/>
Our meeting location puts us only a block or so from Union Station, <br/>
DOD HQ this year, where more info and volunteers will be available to <br/>
answer questions, and it's also only a few blocks from the FREE 16th <br/>
Mall Shuttle which will make getting around downtown proper a bit <br/>
easier for the day.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone is into urban bicycling, the 16th Street Mall allows bikes <br/>
on Sundays only and this would be a great way to speed up the <br/>
distances between DOD and letterbox locations without dealing with <br/>
cars.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of cars, since I just know you out-of-towners are going to <br/>
ask:<br/>
<br/>
What about parking?<br/>
<br/>
Street parking downtown "should" be OK-ish on a Sunday morning and <br/>
for the most part free.  I will note that parking WEST of Union <br/>
Station (say near my, Denver Skatepark and D.O.D. boxes, plus quite a <br/>
few other boxes that could be walkable along the Platte River) is <br/>
restricted to TWO hours only, even on Sundays!  Check the signage in <br/>
this area and maybe make sure you have a supply of coins for the day!<br/>
<br/>
Another alternative is to park near the Central Library and Denver <br/>
Art Museum (another bunch of boxes in this area) If you can't find <br/>
street parking, garage rates are reasonable by downtown standards <br/>
here: <br/>
http://www.denverartmuseum.org/visit_us/plan_your_visit/parking   <br/>
<br/>
This would also put you in the area of quite a few DOD sites up on <br/>
Capitol Hill, and you could then take the 16th Street Mall Shuttle to <br/>
the meeting place at the caf.<br/>
<br/>
Think that's it  other than to say, don't be at all surprised if <br/>
some more letterbox clues make their appearances prior to our DOD <br/>
event.  I for one, will also commit to having such clues up no later <br/>
than 8 p.m. on Friday the 13th, so remember to look before you head <br/>
out to Denver.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to meeting you all for some Denver exploring!<br/>

Doors Open Denver is a FREE two-day event that allows you to go behind <br/>
the scenes at nearly 80 of the city's significant architectural gems <br/>
and lesser known treasures.  Spend the day on a self-guided tour of <br/>
both historic and modern buildings, take an expert-led tour or embark <br/>
on an Urban Adventure, a self-guided tour based on a theme.<br/>

I'll be there and I'll have my PT, Boone, which is<br/>
listed on both AQ and LbNA.  <br/>
<br/>
For those hoping to avoid the downtown parking<br/>
dilemma, light rail might be a good option depending<br/>
on what you want to see.  The light rail, in<br/>
combination with the 16th Street Mall shuttle, can get<br/>
you to a number of downtown buildings *and*<br/>
letterboxes.  Here's more info:<br/>

I will be placing at least one more downtown box<br/>
before DOD - I hope to have clues posted by Monday.<br/>

&gt; Ok everyone, as promised, here's the info for our mini DOD informal <br/>
&gt; gathering and urban exploring opportunity on Sunday, April 15th<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Timing is everything!  TODAY  April 6th  in BOTH the Denver Post <br/>
&gt; AND Rocky Mountain News you'll find a copy of the pull out guide for <br/>
&gt; Doors Open Denver.  Run out and get your copy NOW!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This will give you a chance to read up and plan which buildings you'd <br/>
&gt; like to explore/work in with nearby letterboxes/and so on.  Then, <br/>
&gt; after everyone arrives, we do some exchanges, chat, etc we can <br/>
&gt; (hopefully) arrange ourselves into groups with people who want to see <br/>
&gt; similar DOD places/parts of town/'boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll try and stop by and get extra copies of the guide this week to <br/>
&gt; hand out on the 15th, but please do try and get your own copy TODAY!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Most DOD locations are only open until about 4 pm, so in order to <br/>
&gt; allow plenty of time to do exchanges, letterbox, and still have most <br/>
&gt; of the afternoon for DOD exploring, here's the plan:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We'll meet:<br/>
&gt; Sunday, April 15th  - 10:30 am<br/>
&gt; Indoor meeting place.   You never know about the weather!<br/>
&gt; Common Grounds Coffeehouse<br/>
&gt; 1601 17th St, Denver, 80202<br/>
&gt; 303) 296-9248<br/>
&gt; Some more info: http://tinyurl.com/22h6oy<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll be the blonde (female) wearing the explorer's hat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll try to get there about 10 a.m. and attempt to stake out a table <br/>
&gt; large enough for our group.  Based on posts here and previous emails <br/>
&gt; I'm thinking we may have 10-15 people and would like to confirm <br/>
&gt; this...sooooo<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; CAN WE GET A HEAD COUNT? Please post here not later than 8 pm FRIDAY, <br/>
&gt; April 13th with the following info:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1)Yes, we're still planning on coming!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2)X number of people will be in our party and our trail names <br/>
&gt; are ?????? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can anyone say: Personal Travelers? <winks>  I of course will be <br/>
&gt; there!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Our meeting location puts us only a block or so from Union Station, <br/>
&gt; DOD HQ this year, where more info and volunteers will be available to <br/>
&gt; answer questions, and it's also only a few blocks from the FREE 16th <br/>
&gt; Mall Shuttle which will make getting around downtown proper a bit <br/>
&gt; easier for the day.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If anyone is into urban bicycling, the 16th Street Mall allows bikes <br/>
&gt; on Sundays only and this would be a great way to speed up the <br/>
&gt; distances between DOD and letterbox locations without dealing with <br/>
&gt; cars.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Speaking of cars, since I just know you out-of-towners are going to <br/>
&gt; ask:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What about parking?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Street parking downtown "should" be OK-ish on a Sunday morning and <br/>
&gt; for the most part free.  I will note that parking WEST of Union <br/>
&gt; Station (say near my, Denver Skatepark and D.O.D. boxes, plus quite a <br/>
&gt; few other boxes that could be walkable along the Platte River) is <br/>
&gt; restricted to TWO hours only, even on Sundays!  Check the signage in <br/>
&gt; this area and maybe make sure you have a supply of coins for the day!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another alternative is to park near the Central Library and Denver <br/>
&gt; Art Museum (another bunch of boxes in this area) If you can't find <br/>
&gt; street parking, garage rates are reasonable by downtown standards <br/>
&gt; here: <br/>
&gt; http://www.denverartmuseum.org/visit_us/plan_your_visit/parking   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This would also put you in the area of quite a few DOD sites up on <br/>
&gt; Capitol Hill, and you could then take the 16th Street Mall Shuttle to <br/>
&gt; the meeting place at the caf.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Think that's it  other than to say, don't be at all surprised if <br/>
&gt; some more letterbox clues make their appearances prior to our DOD <br/>
&gt; event.  I for one, will also commit to having such clues up no later <br/>
&gt; than 8 p.m. on Friday the 13th, so remember to look before you head <br/>
&gt; out to Denver.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Looking forward to meeting you all for some Denver exploring!<br/>

Tommorrow, however doesn't look great here...so it's possible that one <br/>

to use!  heeheheh...well hey, it would get ya through the weekend at <br/>

looking for more journals and stamps (we know they don't need <br/>
tupperware boxes, at any rate!  Ha!).  Have fun!  Hugs to all!<br/>

Dread Peach sharping up her cutlass in case she comes across the <br/>
