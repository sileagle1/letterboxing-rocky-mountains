                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you to preboxed and the Colorado boxers we were able to meet <br>
last Saturday at the Mini Meet in Golden.  Lizman and I had such a <br>
great time and have really enjoyed finding a few of the local <br>
Colorado boxes during our trip.  We head back to Boise tomorrow but <br>
really appreciate all the hospitality and great memories of our visit.<br>
<br>
I have been computer-less (gasp) for the past 5 days and am just <br>
catching up on things.  Here are the actual clues for the Mystical <br>
Meow box that I planted last Saturday. Sorry for the delay.  I ran <br>
back to the computer that day and thought I had lost the clues but my <br>
sister was able to recover them for me (whew)!  <br>
<br>

This box is planted as a thank you for preboxed who hosting a Mini <br>
Meet for myself and Lizman while we were visiting Colorado.  Thank <br>
you for rolling out the red carpet for us!!!<br>
Prebox will receive the clues at the Meet & Greet.  The clues will be <br>
posted for everyone Saturday evening.<br>
Location: Clear Creek Path, Golden, Colorado<br>
<br>
Directions: Park at the Golden Library, 1019 Tenth St. (Cheyenne <br>
Street and 10th Street.)<br>
<br>
Additional information if you love to get wet:  Cool off at Clear <br>
Creek Whitewater Park located in Golden, Colorado at 10th & Maple. <br>
The whitewater park is a popular place to get wet riverboarding, <br>
kayaking, tubing, or wading in Summer. Peak flows occur early in <br>
Summer (late May - early June) with 1,000+ cfs and Class II+ rapids. <br>
July and August are better months to tube and wade as the flows are <br>
much lower (200+ cfs) and water temps higher (60 degrees if you're <br>
lucky). Clear Creek whitewater park extends from the start of the <br>
foot path (approx 1/2 mile west of the campground) to Vanouver park <br>
on Ford Street north of Coors - 1 1/2 miles in total length. The most <br>
popular stretches are from 10th & Maple (Lions Park) to the Library <br>
Hole.The park was developed by reinforcing the sides of Clear Creek <br>
with boulders and cement to create whitewater features along Clear <br>
Creek from Maple Street to Washington street south of 10th Street. It <br>
is open to the public (enter at your own risk - PFD and helmet are <br>
recommended) with the most parking near the Golden Rec Center and <br>
Lions Park at 10th& Maple. Weekends are crowded in late Summer and a <br>
weekly rodeo event is held on Wednesday evenings during the month of <br>
June.<br>
<br>
Clues:  Park at the library and head to the Clear Creek Path that <br>
follows the river and is located behind the Library.  Follow the path <br>
to your left.  Immediately you will come upon a small rose garden on <br>
your left that is situated in front of the D'Deli eatery at D'Creek.  <br>
Continue on the path until you come to an information sign <br>
titled "Down by the Old Mill Stream" also on your left.  The Mythical <br>
Meow you are seeking is behind the giant round stone under a small <br>
log and rocks.  Please re-hide carefully as this area has heavy foot <br>
traffic and the patio seating to the eatery is very close by.  <br>
<br>
Should you note the box missing, its contents in bad repair or if you <br>
just want to say "hi" please contact me at Blackvelvetrav@yahoo.com. <br>
Happy hunting!<br>
