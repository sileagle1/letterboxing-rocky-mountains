<br/>
"Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Eric Holzman, I work with the Jefferson County Open Space<br/>
Rangers. I'm writing you regarding your letterbox that was placed on<br/>
Welchester Park. One of our Rangers confronted some kids in the park<br/>
regarding an ordinance violation, and found your letterbox in their<br/>
posession. After he completed his business with the kids he showd me <br/>
the<br/>
box, buthe did not know where they got it. We looked for a probable<br/>
location but could not find one. We decided it would be better to <br/>
bring<br/>
it in and contact you, rather than guess and place it in a hiding spot<br/>
you may not be able to find.<br/>
<br/>
We will hold the box here at the office for awhile and wait to hear<br/>
from you. Our phone number is 303-271-5938. Our location is 700<br/>
Jefferson County Parkway, suite 200, Golden, Co. You can pick up the <br/>
box<br/>
here during regular business hours during the week, or call and <br/>
arrange<br/>
a time to meet a Ranger here during the weekend. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Eric Holzman<br/>
<br/>
PS: Loved your stamp!"<br/>
<br/>
So I headed on down there, and the box is there - complete and in <br/>
perfect condition!! I have to completely re-hide it in a new spot, <br/>
but thanks to Eric the Ranger, I get that opportunity!<br/>
