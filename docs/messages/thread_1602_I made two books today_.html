                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last weekend the Catamount Carvers encouraged me to try the book <br>
binding tutorial on Atlas Quest.  I spent this past week collecting <br>
supplies and courage and today I tried it.  The results look a lot like <br>
logbooks!  I still have room for improvement, to be sure, but I was <br>
pleasantly surprised by how the books turned out.<br>
<br>
Count me among those eagerly awaiting the workshop so I can learn some <br>
more and improve on what I've done!!  And thanks for the encouragement, <br>
Catamounts!!<br>
<br>
If any of you want to check it out, it's here:<br>
<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/tutorials/logbooks/codex/<br>
<br>
It takes some time (especially the first time) but if I can do it, <br>
anyone can!  The instructions are really clear and the pictures are <br>
helpful.<br>

I'll have you know that I used that exact same tutorial to make two of <br>
my logbooks for Mt. Doom. =3<br>
<br>
It really isn't hard. Time consuming - a little. Especially that first <br>
time. But certainly not hard! The hardest part is coming up with the <br>
idea for how the finished product is going to work itself out. I start <br>
with something simple, and then my ideas take on lives of their own and <br>
I end up with saudered wire spider webs! =3<br>

I am always more than happy to answer questions about any of the books <br>

My modest first efforts are nothing like your beautiful logbooks.  I think I wrote in one of my Mt Doom comments that my only "complaint" about your boxes is that I can't get an image of your logbook in my personal book next to my impression of your stamp.  <br>
<br>
I guess my question would be: how can I make my books look as beautiful as yours? ;)<br>
<br>
In all seriousness, thanks for the offer and, as I get a little braver in playing around with these books, I will probably take you up on it by asking some real questions.  I am seriously excited about the workshop now.<br>
