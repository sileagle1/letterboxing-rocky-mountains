<br>
I can't remember if I've introduced myself yet, so here's a brief one...<br>
I'm Kim Stone aka Phoenix, living in Denver proper.  Have just started the<br>
actual letterboxing but have been interested for several months. <br>
Unfortunately, due to crazy work schedule, new home, rescuing cats, and<br>
general insanity, I haven't been hiking all that much recently.  I've got<br>
a 4yo son, Connor aka Little Fire Feather, and the most wonderful<br>
boyfriend in the world, Tim White, involved as well.<br>
<br>
I am sad that we weren't able to make the gathering.  It sounds like a ton<br>
of fun ... We had made plans to head to the Springs to letterbox with<br>
Tim's family a month ago!!  Anyway, we (all six of us, 4 parents and 2<br>
littles (Xander at 20 months!)) found the Bear Creek box.  Looks good,<br>
just wasn't covered well.  After we all stamped and gawked, then cleaned<br>
up a major leg scrape on the smallest little, I placed the box back and<br>
coved well with rocks and pine needles.<br>
<br>
I am hoping to go out again this afternoon, but Little Fire Feather is<br>
thinking that hiking might be a little too hard for him today.  Such is<br>
life with littles :)<br>
<br>
Thanks for the super organization!! I hope to meet many of you soon.<br>
<br>
Phoenix<br>
