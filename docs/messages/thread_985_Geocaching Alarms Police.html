<br/>
BOISE, Idaho - In a game of global positioning called geocaching, <br/>
the lowly treasure hunt has gone high-tech  but it can also be a <br/>
game of risk when terrorism-sensitive authorities find the goods <br/>
first. <br/>
<br/>
Scot Tintsman found that out when he stashed a green bucket under an <br/>
Idaho highway bridge last September, intending to fill it with <br/>
goodies for other players to find using Global Positioning System <br/>
units. But before he could finish adding the requisite trinkets and <br/>
log books and posting its GPS coordinates on the Internet, a bridge <br/>
inspection crew found it.<br/>
<br/>
Rounding a corner on his motorcycle to finish rigging his cache, he <br/>
was greeted by a barricade of police cars and a bomb squad. He <br/>
struggled to explain the misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>
"I got off my bike and three officers approached me very cautiously, <br/>
hands on their holsters," he said. "I was trying to turn off my MP3 <br/>
player and I think they were worried I was going for a detonator."<br/>
<br/>
Tintsman and other geocachers play the game this way: Participants <br/>
stash a vessel of some sort containing goods as a reward for the <br/>
person who finds the "cache," as it's known. The person or group <br/>
hiding the cache posts the hiding place's GPS coordinates on the <br/>
Internet. People who find the cache are expected to take something <br/>
from it and replace it with something else.<br/>
<br/>
In November, a geocache outside a police station in Provo, Utah, met <br/>
a bomb squad robot as its fate. It contained a toy gun, holster and <br/>
nightstick.<br/>
<br/>
In June, a bomb squad in De Pere, Wis., used a robot-mounted shotgun <br/>
to blast the lid off a suspicious-looking military ammunition box <br/>
found in a park. It also turned out to be a geocache.<br/>
<br/>
And on the night before the 2004 presidential election, police and <br/>
the     FBI spent hours questioning a man seen prowling along a <br/>
fence at Los Angeles International Airport with a GPS unit. He was a <br/>
geocacher from Vermont trying to stash a toy snake into a cache, <br/>
placed five weeks earlier, that had already been visited by 463 <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
Guidelines on Geocaching.com  the most popular Web clearinghouse <br/>
for registering geocache hides and finds  advise players not to <br/>
place caches near critical infrastructure or public buildings that <br/>
might be terrorist targets. And with more than 1 million people <br/>
worldwide estimated to participate, Geocaching.com co-founder Bryan <br/>
Roth of Seattle says the number of homeland security false alarms is <br/>
comparatively low.<br/>
<br/>
"I dare say I have heard of no more than five or 10 incidents," said <br/>
Roth, whose Web site lists more than 225,000 caches in 219 <br/>
countries. "Police can always contact us and we'll tell them whether <br/>
something is a registered geocache. And if they're still not <br/>
comfortable with that, we tell them to blow it up. We don't want to <br/>
be legally or, more importantly, morally liable if it indeed was a <br/>
problem."<br/>
<br/>
Many geocachers fear the pastime could be banned in some areas <br/>
because of the scares caused by ill-advised cache placements. <br/>
A "Geocacher's Creed" posted on the Internet asks participants <br/>
to "avoid causing disruptions or public alarm."<br/>
<br/>
Even when geocachers cause public alarm, severe criminal <br/>
repercussions appear to be rare.<br/>
<br/>
Tintsman, whose geocache sat high above the whitewater of Idaho's <br/>
Payette River, was charged with placing debris on public property, a <br/>
misdemeanor punishable by six months in jail and a $300 fine.<br/>
<br/>
County prosecutor Matthew Williams said that he is not seeking jail <br/>
time but that he would like restitution for the expense of the law <br/>
enforcement response.<br/>
<br/>
Tintsman said he is still avidly geocaching  but with a better <br/>
awareness of how it might look in a post-Sept. 11 landscape.<br/>
<br/>
"I wasn't thinking about terrorism when I placed it under the <br/>
bridge. I was thinking about making the most extreme cache <br/>
possible," he said. "I just got carried away."<br/>
