<br>
BOISE, Idaho - In a game of global positioning called geocaching, <br>
the lowly treasure hunt has gone high-tech  but it can also be a <br>
game of risk when terrorism-sensitive authorities find the goods <br>
first. <br>
 <br>
Scot Tintsman found that out when he stashed a green bucket under an <br>
Idaho highway bridge last September, intending to fill it with <br>
goodies for other players to find using Global Positioning System <br>
units. But before he could finish adding the requisite trinkets and <br>
log books and posting its GPS coordinates on the Internet, a bridge <br>
inspection crew found it.<br>
<br>
Rounding a corner on his motorcycle to finish rigging his cache, he <br>
was greeted by a barricade of police cars and a bomb squad. He <br>
struggled to explain the misunderstanding.<br>
<br>
"I got off my bike and three officers approached me very cautiously, <br>
hands on their holsters," he said. "I was trying to turn off my MP3 <br>
player and I think they were worried I was going for a detonator."<br>
<br>
Tintsman and other geocachers play the game this way: Participants <br>
stash a vessel of some sort containing goods as a reward for the <br>
person who finds the "cache," as it's known. The person or group <br>
hiding the cache posts the hiding place's GPS coordinates on the <br>
Internet. People who find the cache are expected to take something <br>
from it and replace it with something else.<br>
<br>
In November, a geocache outside a police station in Provo, Utah, met <br>
a bomb squad robot as its fate. It contained a toy gun, holster and <br>
nightstick.<br>
<br>
In June, a bomb squad in De Pere, Wis., used a robot-mounted shotgun <br>
to blast the lid off a suspicious-looking military ammunition box <br>
found in a park. It also turned out to be a geocache.<br>
<br>
And on the night before the 2004 presidential election, police and <br>
the     FBI spent hours questioning a man seen prowling along a <br>
fence at Los Angeles International Airport with a GPS unit. He was a <br>
geocacher from Vermont trying to stash a toy snake into a cache, <br>
placed five weeks earlier, that had already been visited by 463 <br>
people.<br>
<br>
Guidelines on Geocaching.com  the most popular Web clearinghouse <br>
for registering geocache hides and finds  advise players not to <br>
place caches near critical infrastructure or public buildings that <br>
might be terrorist targets. And with more than 1 million people <br>
worldwide estimated to participate, Geocaching.com co-founder Bryan <br>
Roth of Seattle says the number of homeland security false alarms is <br>
comparatively low.<br>
<br>
"I dare say I have heard of no more than five or 10 incidents," said <br>
Roth, whose Web site lists more than 225,000 caches in 219 <br>
countries. "Police can always contact us and we'll tell them whether <br>
something is a registered geocache. And if they're still not <br>
comfortable with that, we tell them to blow it up. We don't want to <br>
be legally or, more importantly, morally liable if it indeed was a <br>
problem."<br>
<br>
Many geocachers fear the pastime could be banned in some areas <br>
because of the scares caused by ill-advised cache placements. <br>
A "Geocacher's Creed" posted on the Internet asks participants <br>
to "avoid causing disruptions or public alarm."<br>
<br>
Even when geocachers cause public alarm, severe criminal <br>
repercussions appear to be rare.<br>
<br>
Tintsman, whose geocache sat high above the whitewater of Idaho's <br>
Payette River, was charged with placing debris on public property, a <br>
misdemeanor punishable by six months in jail and a $300 fine.<br>
<br>
County prosecutor Matthew Williams said that he is not seeking jail <br>
time but that he would like restitution for the expense of the law <br>
enforcement response.<br>
<br>
Tintsman said he is still avidly geocaching  but with a better <br>
awareness of how it might look in a post-Sept. 11 landscape.<br>
<br>
"I wasn't thinking about terrorism when I placed it under the <br>
bridge. I was thinking about making the most extreme cache <br>
possible," he said. "I just got carried away."<br>
