Yayy! I finally checked on the Happy Birthday - Ten Years Box in Moab <br>
this morning after a report that it might be missing, and guess what?<br>
It's still there waiting patiently for those who might find it!!!!!<br>
After having a HH destroyed last week, I am doing the Moab-a-cisco-<br>
disco dance after finding this one in good shape!<br>

And *I* am the pirate that must have been looking right at it and not <br>
