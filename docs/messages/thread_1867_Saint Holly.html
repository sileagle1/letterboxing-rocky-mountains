<br/>
Long time no chat? How are we all doing? How is the warm spring weather treating you? <br/>
<br/>
Today, as some of us know, is Holly's birthday. Our famous PreBoxed loved this holiday, and tried to incorporate her wit into the day every year. <br/>
<br/>
At her memorial, I had said that Aljan and I were going to put together a memory stamp/book for her, and that has been completed. (Not kidding - promise. :))<br/>
<br/>
I have spent a lot of time trying to decide what to do with it, and how to handle it. Holly knew a LOT of people all over the country, and I would like to send the book out for the people who knew her to sign and stamp, but I want to give those of us from her home region first crack at it. <br/>
<br/>
I would like it to be a memorial book in the true sense of the word. No just stamp and go. I want people to put in pictures, LTC's personal stories about how they knew Holly, or what they knew of her. I want people to take few pages and express themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I was really hoping to have a gathering put together by today, but illness kept me busy the entire month of March.<br/>
<br/>
How many of you would be interested in getting Aljan's fabulous stamp, and contributing? It's going to take some time, and it's not exactly a traditional gathering. If I can get a bit of a head count, I can start arranging a time/place. <br/>
<br/>
Miss you guys! We need to get together for some spring fun. <br/>

I would be interested please.  I never met her face to face, but we emailed a lot when I was on the road and did maintence on her boxes right before she passed away.  I never knew she was ill, just that I was going that way and she had boxes in need of some TLC.      <br/>

<br/>
I'd be interested in participating, too, either in person or by mail.  I will be at Copper Mountain June 14-17 and could come down to the city any time during my stay there, if that works into some sort of convenient time.  Will be watching for more information.  I think it's lovely that you guys are remembering Holly in this way.  She would say, "You ROCK!"<br/>

No worries that you won't get to see it because you don't live here in Colorado! It will make the rounds, starting with the regional folks. :)<br/>
