What an awesome little road trip we took! Just an overnight trip for <br>
fun, so there was some time to do some boxing. Started with a stop <br>
at the Animas Overlook, found the beautiful boxes up there, and <br>
planted the Animas Coyote Box (clues coming soon) as well. If you <br>
haven't been to this spot, it is gorgeous enough by itself, but then <br>
to have a letterbox trail of 5 boxes is just TOO much fun. Then it <br>
was off to continue to Durango, where we found a couple of fun maps <br>
to boxes (clever) and to the beautiful Denver Rio Grande Box. All in <br>
all, I think everyone needs to take a road trip to this area for <br>
some excellence in boxing fun!!!<br>

Woot! I LOVE getting visitors and a new box to boot! This is getting <br>
better all the time.<br>
<br>
I also took a road trip and squeezed in a little boxing. I caught a <br>
Wild West Show, Picked up Jodie's "..It Will Give You Wings" HH, <br>
talked with a little bird, visited a King, ran into a very rude <br>
robot, and a few others before I contemplated the meaning of life.<br>
And the weather could not have been more beautiful. I am always <br>
amazed at how many great trails there are out there, and how many <br>
neat stamps you can find on them.<br>
