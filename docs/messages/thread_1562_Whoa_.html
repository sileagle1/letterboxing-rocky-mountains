I was just saying in an e-mail conversation that I really doubt that <br/>
pre meant to suggest that the Rocky Mountain region is sub-par either <br/>
in its boxes or its boxers.  I am guessing that it was one of those <br/>
late-night messages that most of us have written that just don't come <br/>
out quite the way that we mean them.  <br/>
<br/>
Clearly this region is full of fun boxers who make great boxes for us <br/>
all to enjoy.  I've been lucky enough to do some boxing in other <br/>
parts of the country and to meet some letterboxers in those areas as <br/>
well.  While every region has its charms and I am happy to count <br/>
boxers from those other areas as friends, I think that our <br/>
letterboxers and letterboxes are as good as anyone's.  And, thanks to <br/>
Aljan's talents, we definitely have the best patch.<br/>

I guess I need to catch up on the board to see why "dander is flying", but just wanted to weigh in with my 2 cents on the beautiful badge ;-)<br/>
