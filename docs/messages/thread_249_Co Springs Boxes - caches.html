in return, right?  Who knows? :-)  I found my first hitchhiker in that box<br/>
today, so that made me feel better about the stamp being missing!  I have a<br/>
box that I am going to plant soon... I think I am going to use a Sharpie to<br/>
write on the back of the stamp "This is not a geocache, please do not take<br/>
this stamp."  I would hate for all my hard work to be taken because someone<br/>
mistook it for a prize.<br/>
