gathering up letterboxes as trophys ocurred to me a long time ago. I <br/>
never wanted to even talk about it. But now that someone has stolen <br/>
one of JeLyBeans boxes and refused to return it I am forced to look <br/>
at that possibility. <br/>
<br/>
I don't know if something like this has happened in geocacheing. It <br/>
seems more likely there than in in letterboxing. Easily found with a <br/>
GPS and many more caches. But it seems like letterboxes are so much <br/>
more dear to the owners. Cherished stamp images rather than trinkets. <br/>
When someone found Three Keys and broke the stamp it felt like they <br/>
did it because they knew it would hurt me to see it broken.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I don't know what we could do if someone decided to gather <br/>
up all the boxes they could find in a particular area. <br/>
<br/>
One of the magical things about this pastime is that it even works at <br/>
all. We have to depend on the basic goodness of not only other <br/>
letterboxers, but everyone. I am glad that for the most part we are <br/>
left alone to have our fun and connect with each other through these <br/>
hidden treasures. But with more people finding out about this all the <br/>
time, the risk goes up that there will be some people that want to <br/>
spoil it.<br/>
