<br/>
If anyone is up for an exchange, let me know.  I love to meet other boxers, and depending on your timing, there are some other boxers passing through here in August and July.  It would be fun to coordinate and I'm willing to travel to the parks or Jackson if others don't come down to Idaho Falls.  <br/>
