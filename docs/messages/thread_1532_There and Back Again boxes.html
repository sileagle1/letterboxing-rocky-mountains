<br>
I've had some requests for the list of boxes that will be available <br>
at the gathering.  Keeping in mind that the 'big' list is in Colorado <br>
sitting on my desk, I went through emails and listings and I *think* <br>
I've come pretty close.<br>
<br>
Please forgive me if I've left something off!  Send me a note and <br>
I'll fix it immediately!<br>
<br>
And for those of you still thinking about doing boxes, this will give <br>
you an idea of what is still available.  Woo!  <br>
<br>
Lnd_crzr has a series that go together.. I believe there are 15 of <br>
them.  They'll be on the mountain, but in a second 'loop'.  You'll <br>
understand when you see it.  I'm not worried about duplicating any of <br>
these since they all go together.  <br>
<br>
These are the permanent boxes on the original 'loop':<br>
<br>
Eowyn - Ynought<br>
Shelob- Ravenwolf<br>
Smaug - Ravenwolf<br>
Tom Bombadil - Kennamtn<br>
Goldberry - Miss Moon<br>
Bilbo Baggins - Cherry Chapstick<br>
Faramir, Prince of Ithalian - Esmerelda<br>
Fellowship of the Marmots - Esmerelda<br>
The Precioussss (Golum) - Esmerelda<br>
Ringwraith - Catamount Carvers<br>
Screaming Orc - Catamount Carvers<br>
Witch King of Angmar - JelyBean<br>
Gandalf the Grey - Claudey<br>
Forest of Lothlorien - dbltall<br>
Eye of Sauron - CathCainGwen<br>
White Tree of Gondor - BoxerLover47<br>
Emblem of Idril - Donutz716<br>
Shards of Narsil - Donutz716<br>
Argonath - Donutz<br>
The Ents - Kat<br>
Banner of Rohan - Allemyn<br>
<br>
1 day only boxes to be available during the barbeque/gathering on <br>
Saturday:<br>
<br>
Galadriel's Leaf - DblTall<br>
Slinker & Stinker - Big Ox<br>
to the east I go not - Big Ox<br>
Pedo Mellon A Minno - Big Ox<br>
Doors of Durin - donutz716<br>
Lord of the Rings (Event Box) - Gargoyle Girl<br>
Madame Natascha (Event Box) - Scarab<br>
Oh the Places You'll Go (Event Box) JBanana<br>
<br>
I know a few people are still carving, but I don't know what the <br>
subjects of their stamps are yet and will be happily surprised when I <br>
see them!  I'll keep the list updated as they arrive.<br>
<br>
At this point this will be 36 stamps on the mountain, plus 8 one day <br>
stamps.  Some of the boxes on the mountain will be in clusters.  <br>
Characters who go together may be very close to each other.  Lnd_crzr <br>
and I discussed it and felt it would give everyone a better chance of <br>
getting all of the boxes, plus, people working their way up the <br>
mountain in groups won't have to sit and wait while everyone stamps <br>
in to one box at a time.  <br>
<br>
Here is the event sign up page again.  We'd love to have you join us!<br>

for these 36 BOXES (dies!!) will be distributed.<br>

I'm really hoping to be able to attend the event this year.  Will keep you<br>

<br>
It is my plan to have the clues printed out and available at the <br>
gathering.  I suspect I'll be arranging and rearranging the mountain <br>
right up until the end and who knows where everything will end up.  <br>
I'm working on special journals for each group and should have clues <br>
with those.  <br>
<br>
Some of the one day boxes will be more of a mystery...you'll have to <br>
keep your eyes and ears open on Saturday!  <br>
<br>
Es, who thinks with the one day boxes we will end up with closer to <br>
50 total<br>
