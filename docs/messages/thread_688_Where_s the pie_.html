If you want votes for Ren faire w/e I put my vote in for Jul 16 instead of the 30th (I work<br/>
the Burro races in Fairplay that w/e).<br/>

<br/>
  I almost spit diet Dr. Pepper onto my monitor when the choices for the <br/>
  poll came up.  Y'all crack me the heck up.  I still managed to pull <br/>
  myself together and vote.  I was really hoping that after we voted <br/>
  we'd get a cool sticker to wear that said, 'I voted!'.  Or pie.  <br/>
<br/>
  In regards to the Ren Faire weekend, we're still full steam ahead.  <br/>
  Most likely the last weekend of July.  <br/>
<br/>
  As for the heat in Phoenix?  My momma always said that if you can't <br/>
  say something nice, don't say anything at all. hehehe.  You can always <br/>
  head for the hills!  Plus outdoors in the winter is really wonderful. <br/>

  Es, who heard that they have pie flavored snow cones in Moab <br/>
