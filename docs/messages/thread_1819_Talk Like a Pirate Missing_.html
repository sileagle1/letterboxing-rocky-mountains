No chance.....we were the only people in the park!  And, it was left out in the open in plain sight, I doubt that a true letterboxer would do that.  And, if they had, they would have contacted us to let us know they had it and the box was missing once they went back to put it back.  So, it's gone.  But, thanks for having hope!  We know the risk of letterboxing, but this box had been there for years so we had hope it would survive.  C'est la vie!<br/>

Hugs, Peach <br/>
