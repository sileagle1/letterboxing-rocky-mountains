sentence, "Or you can try letterboxing, which is like geocacheing for <br/>
Luddites." I looked at the LBNA website and was so excited to see a box <br/>
listed about 40 miles from my house.<br/>
<br/>
I tried for hours on three different days to find that thing and almost <br/>
gave up. I went ahead and posted on this list about what a hard time I <br/>
was having and Silver Eagle saw the post and gave me a little coaching. <br/>
I finally found it (I had misread the clue and overshot it by a half <br/>
mile!)....and Letterboxing has been amazing me ever since. I never <br/>
imagined how rewarding it could be......I'm still amazed.<br/>

Greetings:<br/>

<br/>
I was atteneding the 2006?training?for Jefferson County Open Space and they mentioned the Geocache / Letterbox monitoring and it sounded interesting.? I did not join that year but promply went out and got my stamp and log book.? My first find was about a mile away.? The thrill!!? I have been?hooked ever since.? <br/>
<br/>
At the 2007 Training I finally did join the team.? Unfortunily, I am the only Letterboxer in the group.? I had to get into Geocaching?as there are many more geocaches in the parks then letterboxes but I have found that geocachings is as much fun as letterboxing and there is a whole lot more of them out there. So, now my trips include a few letterboxes and all the geocaches around that letterbox I can find.<br/>

I had been geocaching for several years and had even hidden a letterbox<br/>
hybrid cache here in Ogden, so I knew about letterboxing from the link<br/>
on geocaching.com. But I had never found a REAL letterbox until I ran<br/>
across Cadenza's Nut in a Rut at Pineview Reservoir while I was<br/>
searching for a cache located 6 feet away. I tried to log my find and<br/>
couldn't find the box on LBNA, so I emailed Cadenza. She hadn't posted<br/>
the clues yet! I went back later to stamp in and the rest, as they say,<br/>
is history. I've certainly met some super folks through this hobby! And<br/>
had LOTS fo fun!<br/>

I found out about letterboxing through an artists site, where the <br/>
discussion of hand-carved rubber stamps was in full swing.  That was in <br/>
late 2002, and I looked for and found my first box in April of 2003.  <br/>
<br/>
That first box was "The Rock", planted on Alcatraz Island, in the San <br/>
Francisco Bay.  I believe that box is gone, or at least the clues are - <br/>
because the Island is actually a national park (and we know that's a no-<br/>
no).  It was a thrill to be certain, and we were such rookies at it <br/>
that we nearly missed the last ferry back to the mainland in our delay <br/>
in locating the treasure.  I'm pretty sure I posted a photo from that <br/>
trip in the photos section.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Formed this e-group a few months later because of the dearth of <br/>
letterboxes just generally in our area.  :)  Wow ... what a great five <br/>
years it's been.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

couple of you hunting some of my letterboxes.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I heard about letterboxing a few years ago and thought "that's pretty<br/>
cool" and did nothing about it.  In the fall I saw an ad in Family Fun<br/>
magazine and since I was looking to introduce my two young sons (3 &amp;<br/>
1) to the great outdoors, it looked for a good way to get coutside.<br/>
<br/>
I almost gave up after the first box because I was WAAAAAAAY<br/>
overthinking the clues.  It was something like "find the green<br/>
hitching post" which I was convinced was some sort of clue where<br/>
"green" meant "environmental".  It was terrible.  We were<br/>
hot...sweaty...one 20-lb kid was asleep in my arms because I didn't<br/>
bring the stroller because it said "10 minutes in and<br/>
out"...anyway...long story short, there was no mystery to the clues, I<br/>
simply just missed the turn.  Found the letterbox and have found and<br/>
planted a few since.<br/>
<br/>
I typically can only take the boys on trails that are stroller<br/>
friendly or have a playground nearby, so I spend a lot of time looking<br/>
at satellite images on Google Maps.  ;-)  I'm looking forward to doing<br/>
some of the more difficult hikes or urban boxes when I don't have the<br/>
boys with me.<br/>
<br/>
I signed up for the Feb meet, so I'm looking forward to meeting more<br/>
of you.<br/>

in 2004 reminded me about it and explained it all much better. I found my first box two <br/>
days later, (Big Fish - thanks, Es) and planted my first boxes a couple of weeks later (Dead <br/>
Horse Point and Moab Man). Those first boxes from 2004 have been recarved as they wore <br/>
out and chipped and are on their 3rd and 4th journals! Yay!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I read about LB'ing in a US Airways in-flight magazine while on a <br/>
business trip.  This was right after the landmark Smithsonian article <br/>
came out about the Dartmoor boxes in the late 90s.  At that time, <br/>
there were not too many letterboxes in the US (as you might imagine <br/>
since the Smithsonian article was kind of the catalyst here).  But <br/>
surprisingly enough, there were SOME boxes here.  I started looking <br/>
around where I lived (upstate NY at the time) and sure enough there <br/>
were a few boxes within a couple hours drive (maybe a half dozen).  <br/>
My first finds were by a distinguished gentleman named Cock 'O The <br/>
Trail who kind of became my mentor.  His early boxes had some fine <br/>
clues, innovations like multi-boxes, and some neat little tricks I <br/>
won't reveal.  Remember, this was pretty early, so some people were <br/>
pushing the envelope and expanding the hobby in the US even BEFORE <br/>
the Smithsonian article came out.  There being little choices of <br/>
boxes at the time, some of my earliest finds were by people I have <br/>
come to think of as the founding fathers and mothers of letterboxing <br/>
in the US, like Wanda (F:15,000 - and that's not a typo) and Pete, <br/>
Don and Gwen, Silent Doug.  Since then, I have "met" many fine <br/>
letterboxers and have really enjoyed seeing the way this hobby (and <br/>
the amount of boxes!) has grown in the last ten years or so.<br/>

I honestly don't remember where I read about letterboxing, but I do know that I was living in <br/>
Cheyenne at the time, in 2004. I even looked up the few boxes that were there then, but for <br/>
some reason or another didn't give them a try. After we moved to the Springs and I had my <br/>
2nd child, I needed a reason to get out of the house and go do something, so I carved a <br/>
stamp, bought a spiral-bound sketch book and got started. My first box was Horse Thief by <br/>
Vopo near Divide, on the 4th of July '06. I also tried to get Kristen's CES Series: Black-Footed <br/>
Ferret box at the same time, but it was down for repairs then. I have since gone back to get <br/>
that onetotally worth it! This is such a fun hobbyI wish I had more time to devote to it! :)<br/>

I actually heard about letterboxing by word of mouth. We were <br/>
vacationing in Glenwood Springs with some friends who wanted to find a <br/>
box, and they walked us through it. The funny thing, is they had heard <br/>
about it from a friend of theirs - who happened to be Aljan. <br/>
<br/>
Now Aljan and I are good buddies. <br/>
<br/>
The concept was fascinating - an outdoor treasure hunt - what could be <br/>
cooler! Our first box was Dragon's Lair by Autumn's Folly, that was Oct <br/>
of 2003. (So long ago - wow!) Needless to say, we (like everyone here) <br/>
were hooked. <br/>
<br/>
We have met so many fun people, and so many great memories have come <br/>
from this little hobby. Our sincere gratitude to all of you, placers <br/>
and finders, for being such a fantastic crowd. It's great being a part <br/>
of this 'virtual village'.<br/>

I never considered myself a lurker, but, I must admit I've had little <br/>
time for nothing more than to read the daily digest, and sometimes not <br/>
enough time for that...luckily, you all have been busy too so I haven't <br/>
missed out on too much of the action!<br/>
<br/>
I read about about LBing in Aug 2002 in RUBBERSTAMPING magazine and <br/>
immediately went to find our first box, FOUNTAIN VALLEY in Roxborough <br/>
State Park.  There were a couple boxes there by the Jolly G-man and we <br/>
were immediately hooked.  We actually saw a bear there with her baby <br/>
cub which was a heart stopper and unfortunately, Cappy didn't want to <br/>
wait for me to take a picture!  So, it started off with a alot of <br/>
excitement.  Autumn organized the first gathering that Fall at <br/>
Roxborough and then she started this group and we've been part of the <br/>
wallpaper ever since....so, you all have put up with me for a very long <br/>
time!  THANK YOU!!!  Happy New Year....hope I have the BRAINS to solve <br/>
your boxes, because I'm hoping to find more time this year then last to <br/>
get out on the trails!  So, keep an eye out...I may be behind you!<br/>
<br/>
It's been GRINS!!!  <br/>

We found out about letterboxing through Randy Hall's book.  Our small town librarian gave Cirrus the book as his reward for the summer reading program.  She thought we'd be interested in it and she was correct.  Our first box was The Strangest Bird followed by Metamorphosis back when Aljan Sundance was known as Jodie.  We were hooked and have loved meeting fellow boxers!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I heard about letterboxing through a friend in Seattle. She had visited <br/>
a friend in California who was hooked and taken her letterboxing. She <br/>
never got into it but thought it was right up my alley and told me <br/>
about it. So I checked out the website and saw a few boxes in town by <br/>
funhog and one by Silver Eagle. I went to Silver Eagle's Santa Fe Trail <br/>
Microbox first and was hooked from that moment on (July 2005). Thanks <br/>
to everyone for all the fun!!!<br/>
