Woohoo! What a fun note..thanks so much!  Did you by any chance spot <br/>
a compass lying near the Little Raven box?  CWSunseeker dropped <br/>
her's there when she was stamping in. <br/>
<br/>
Here's how I transfer for stamp carving.. I know it's not the best <br/>
way but it works for me. <br/>
I haven't been able to find one of the old type of copy machines, so <br/>
had to go with plan b.  Or c or d depending on who you talk to. <br/>
I print out my design from the computer or draw it by hand. When <br/>
it's the way I want it I go over the lines with a pencil.  I flip it <br/>
onto the carving material, rub all over it back and forth and up and <br/>
down and swirly and jiggy with a blender pen that I got at an art <br/>
store.  It's a clear fluid that's for transferring and blending..I <br/>
just went into the art store and described it and they knew exactly <br/>
what it was.  While it's still kind of damp I rub the back with a <br/>
folder thingie...the bone letter opener looking thing that you use <br/>
to fold paper for books, etc. (got it at a craft store).  You can <br/>
use anything for that I suspect.  I used to do it without the <br/>
blender stuff, and it will transfer.  But with the blender pen you <br/>
get every smidge of pencil to transfer to the rubber (and some of <br/>
the ink from the computer).  At this point I know you could go ahead <br/>
and carve, but I usually go over it all again on the rubber with a <br/>
very fine point black marker.  It doesn't smudge when you're carving <br/>
and gives me sharper lines to carve along.  It sounds like a lot of <br/>
work but it's not really.  You'll have fun! Especially if there's <br/>
pie. <br/>
I bet some of these other folks have some great systems.  Anyone?!<br/>
<br/>
Es, who will be waiting to find your first box!<br/>

&gt; Hi all!  It's been ages since I posted in, but we finally did some <br/>
&gt; New Year's Eve letterboxing and we want to report to the Splendid <br/>
&gt; Buccaneers that both of these two letterboxes are doing fine!  <br/>
What <br/>
&gt; a beautiful day today!  I was so excited to see both of these <br/>
&gt; stamps!  WOW!!!!  For those of you who haven't found these, you <br/>
MUST <br/>
&gt; go!  The stamps are absolutely SPLENDID! And the home made log <br/>
books <br/>
&gt; you must see to appreciate! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Jodi, I too have a a new grandbaby, well, 10 months old now!  He's <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; sweetie!  We wanted to plant our first box but have never carved <br/>
&gt; before and now with all the wonderful stamps we're finding, we're <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; bit intimidated!  We have some ideas but can't seem to get the <br/>
them <br/>
&gt; to transfer easily to the rubber....can anyone help me??? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy NEW year to all!  Have a fruitful letterbox year in 2005!  <br/>
&gt; Hopefully, we will get out there to find more of your boxes this <br/>
&gt; year! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks again to ES and the Splendid Buccaneers for the FUN boxes!<br/>

ES, we did in fact find the compass inside the letterbox.  We <br/>
thought it was odd that it was in there, but thought you left it in <br/>
there for fun!  It's still there if CWSunseeker wants to go back for <br/>
it.  Now is a good time, NO SNOW on the ground that would show <br/>
tracks!  In fact, today was so gorgeous!  The log book "holder" (I <br/>
don't want to give it away) is so special....what thought you put <br/>
into your boxes!!! THANKS AGAIN, ES!  WE LOVE YOUR BOXES! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you and Jodi for the stamp tips!  We will try it out and <br/>
try to get some "P"'s in our name! Happy New Year to you, as the <br/>
clock runs down towards midnight!  (BTW, what time zone is this <br/>
group recording in...it already shows it's 2005!).<br/>

She had mentioned dropping it to me right after she found the box <br/>
and someone else said they saw it but left it because they didn't <br/>
know who it belonged to and thought they might be coming back for <br/>
it.  She had already gone on home, so when I told her it had been <br/>
seen she said not to worry about it.  But I'd really like to scoop <br/>
it up and send it to her.  I was going to post a note on the Little <br/>
Raven clues but didn't get a chance to do so in time.<br/>
I'll be coming that way sometime here soon and will swing by and get <br/>
it.. it sounds like it's in the box so it will surely be safe!  <br/>
If someone goes up before then and wants to grab it for her, that'd <br/>
be wonderful, too!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; onto the carving material, rub all over it back and forth and <br/>
up<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; down and swirly and jiggy with a blender pen that I got at an <br/>
art<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; store.  It's a clear fluid that's for transferring and <br/>
blending..I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; just went into the art store and described it and they knew<br/>
&gt; &gt; exactly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what it was.  While it's still kind of damp I rub the back <br/>
with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; folder thingie...the bone letter opener looking thing that you <br/>
use<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to fold paper for books, etc. (got it at a craft store).  You <br/>
can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; use anything for that I suspect.  I used to do it without the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; blender stuff, and it will transfer.  But with the blender pen <br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; get every smidge of pencil to transfer to the rubber (and some <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the ink from the computer).  At this point I know you could go<br/>
&gt; &gt; ahead<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and carve, but I usually go over it all again on the rubber <br/>
with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; very fine point black marker.  It doesn't smudge when you're<br/>
&gt; &gt; carving<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and gives me sharper lines to carve along.  It sounds like a <br/>
lot<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; work but it's not really.  You'll have fun! Especially if <br/>
there's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pie.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I bet some of these other folks have some great systems.  <br/>
Anyone?!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all!  It's been ages since I posted in, but we finally did<br/>
&gt; &gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; New Year's Eve letterboxing and we want to report to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Splendid<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Buccaneers that both of these two letterboxes are doing fine!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a beautiful day today!  I was so excited to see both of these<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stamps!  WOW!!!!  For those of you who haven't found these, <br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; MUST<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go!  The stamps are absolutely SPLENDID! And the home made <br/>
log<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; books<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you must see to appreciate!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jodi, I too have a a new grandbaby, well, 10 months old now!<br/>
&gt; &gt; He's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweetie!  We wanted to plant our first box but have never <br/>
carved<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before and now with all the wonderful stamps we're finding,<br/>
&gt; &gt; we're<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bit intimidated!  We have some ideas but can't seem to get <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to transfer easily to the rubber....can anyone help me???<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Happy NEW year to all!  Have a fruitful letterbox year in <br/>
2005!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hopefully, we will get out there to find more of your boxes <br/>
this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

She had mentioned dropping it to me right after she found the box <br/>
and someone else said they saw it but left it because they didn't <br/>
know who it belonged to and thought they might be coming back for <br/>
it.  She had already gone on home, so when I told her it had been <br/>
seen she said not to worry about it.  But I'd really like to scoop <br/>
it up and send it to her.  I was going to post a note on the Little <br/>
Raven clues but didn't get a chance to do so in time.<br/>
I'll be coming that way sometime here soon and will swing by and get <br/>
it.. it sounds like it's in the box so it will surely be safe!  <br/>
If someone goes up before then and wants to grab it for her, that'd <br/>
be wonderful, too!<br/>

&gt; &gt; ES, we did in fact find the compass inside the letterbox.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought it was odd that it was in there, but thought you left it <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; there for fun!  It's still there if CWSunseeker wants to go back <br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; it.  Now is a good time, NO SNOW on the ground that would show<br/>
&gt; &gt; tracks!  In fact, today was so gorgeous!  The log book "holder" <br/>
(I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don't want to give it away) is so special....what thought you put<br/>
&gt; &gt; into your boxes!!! THANKS AGAIN, ES!  WE LOVE YOUR BOXES!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks to you and Jodi for the stamp tips!  We will try it out <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; try to get some "P"'s in our name! Happy New Year to you, as the<br/>
&gt; &gt; clock runs down towards midnight!  (BTW, what time zone is this<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Woohoo! What a fun note..thanks so much!  Did you by any chance<br/>
&gt; &gt; spot<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a compass lying near the Little Raven box?  CWSunseeker dropped<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; her's there when she was stamping in.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Here's how I transfer for stamp carving.. I know it's not the <br/>
best<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; way but it works for me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't been able to find one of the old type of copy <br/>
machines,<br/>
&gt; &gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; had to go with plan b.  Or c or d depending on who you talk to.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I print out my design from the computer or draw it by hand. <br/>
When<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's the way I want it I go over the lines with a pencil.  I <br/>
flip<br/>
&gt; &gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; onto the carving material, rub all over it back and forth and <br/>
up<br/>
