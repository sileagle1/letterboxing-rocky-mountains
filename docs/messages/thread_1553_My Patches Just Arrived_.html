Aljan, I checked on your box at the beginning of June, and everything was in great shape on <br>
both boxes, although we added a few more rocks on the pile. The journal had some more <br>
space in it, but I think it is getting pretty full. I'll check again in a couple of weeks when my <br>
knee is moving better!<br>
