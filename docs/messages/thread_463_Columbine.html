I'm going to agree agree that you probably shouldn't do it yet, but I<br/>
think some could do it tastefully, if very, very, very careful.  But I<br/>
think there are many that could be offended regardless of your tact. <br/>
If you felt strongly about doing something.  I think you could have<br/>
some kind of very nice tribute somewhere a little more removed than at<br/>
Columbine--oh, and I probably wouldn't discuss it on the big list.  I<br/>
can see someone turning it into an ugly flame.<br/>
<br/>
This is much more removed than our immediate history, but I found one<br/>
letterbox that was at a very important yet unknown part of US and<br/>
Native American history.  It is part of our country's forgotten<br/>
history, and it is a shame that others haven't known about it.  I<br/>
don't think I can say more without giving clues away.<br/>
<br/>
I can think of many that would feel this was a desecration of a sacred<br/>
place for many cultures.  The planter put her heart and soul into it<br/>
though and her nicest carving to that date.  She hid it in a larger<br/>
box and included an in-depth reading of the history of that place and<br/>
its culture and why it was important for all of us to understand it<br/>
better and honor the people who had gone before.  The box clue was<br/>
hidden with a name that was different than what one might expect, so<br/>
it wasn't flaunting "Oh, here, I put a box at a sacred place. Isn't it<br/>
cool!" I haven't seen her push the box.  She has been very unassuming<br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
I learned so much from doing this letterbox and was grateful for it. <br/>
I'm not going to tell you which it is though and ruin it.  Sorry!  And<br/>
I have letterboxed all over the western US and through many other<br/>
places, so it could be anywhere.  I think she struck a nice balance<br/>
that not many could have done.<br/>
<br/>
Well, this has been a nice diversion from work for a few.  Now back to<br/>
the grindstone!  Hope you don't mind my two cents (actually, I'm not<br/>
good at two cent writing.  I do more like a quarter :)<br/>
