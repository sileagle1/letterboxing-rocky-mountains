contribute again anyway.  This made me think of all of you.<br>
<br>
I had a very happy encounter the other day.  I stopped by a friend's<br>
house on my way back from a presentation and she invited me to stay<br>
for dinner.  It was very nice.  After everything was done and I was<br>
ready to leave, she said, "You would like some pie, wouldn't you?"  Of<br>
course I answered yes, to which she responded, "which kind, banana<br>
cream or coconut cream?"<br>
<br>
Oh, heavens, need you ask?  BOTH!<br>
<br>
Ah, yes, life is good! (and it was homemade too!) <br>

-who just decided to go buy a pie for the pot luck that she has to go<br>
to tonight.  I'm thinking raspberry cream--heavenly!  I guess I should<br>
find some way to make the post about letterboxing so it isn't<br>
completely off-topic . . . umm . . .huh . . . Hey, this friend likes<br>
to take me for drives in the mountains when I'm stressed and she has<br>
taken her grandkids to find my Big Springs Series in Island Park. <br>
Isn't that nice?<br>
