take advantage of a couple of hours of sunshine this afternoon to get <br>
in some boxing in Colorado Springs.<br>
<br>
Was not a very successful day...only one in four boxes.  A couple of <br>
the boxes were new or fairly new boxes.  I suspect that the amount of <br>
rain that has been drenching us has turned the tupperware into <br>
flotillas.  Just looking around in some of the locations you can see <br>
that a lot of water had run through those areas.<br>
 <br>
I'm suggesting that if you've had a bunch of rain lately, as we have, <br>
you may want to do a box check.<br>
<br>
FYI - the one box we found was anchored in place on three sides by <br>
large rocks with a SPOR on the 4th side.  Lesson learned for me in <br>
placing boxes in the future!<br>
