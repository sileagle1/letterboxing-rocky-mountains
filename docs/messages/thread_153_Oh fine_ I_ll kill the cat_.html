see you some of your other fellow mountain types are.  I've <br/>
posted a copy of the photo from the gathering in Boise on the <br/>
10th.  As soon as I have a printout of the Salt Lake gather, I'll put <br/>
that up too (my camera's not digital).<br/>
<br/>
This was so much fun!  I hope one of these days we can find a <br/>
time that more of us can meet, but I still must say I've been <br/>
impressed.  In Salt Lake and Boise both we had letterboxers <br/>
from several states.<br/>
