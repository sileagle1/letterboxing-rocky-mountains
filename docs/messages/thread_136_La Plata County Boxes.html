      Both Autumn and I have tried to get the Colorado map fixed so <br/>
that La Plata County is listed with it's neighbors on the Western <br/>
Slope. Since we haven't had any luck I decided to add a listing under <br/>
Archuleta County on the website to direct people to the Front Range <br/>
for more boxes in the area. <br/>
      Have a look and see what you think. If this causes more <br/>
confusion than it solves I will be happy to delete it. <br/>
      It is kind of like another layer to the clues for boxes down <br/>
here.<br/>
       Cheers,<br/>
