Also tried to delete the Boxer Lover's Moab Trip 05-2005 album, but<br>
couldn't. Can you see I'm not terribly Yahoo literate?! So if one of<br>
you wonderful moderators would do that for me, thanks.<br>

SW, Kelly is SO CUTE!!!! And those cloudy boys aren't bad themselves.8~)<br>
<br>
I'm proud of my geocaching history, y.8~O A hunter has to start<br>
somewhere and letterboxing wasn't around when I had that hankering.<br>
Like I told Cadenza once, I am the same person whether I am 'boxing or<br>
'caching - caring for the enviornment, leaving no trace, etc. Hey,<br>
does anyone know if Cadenza got married and moved to Wales? Wasn't<br>
that supposed to happen in October?<br>

them were really fun.<br>

Catamount Pumpkin Carver's folder is renamed. Boxer Lover's Moab Trip <br>
is deleted.<br>

SW, that collie looks smart enough to learn CPR.<br>

y-nought, also wondering about our Cadenza.....<br>

Congrats Boxer Lover ... that is a nice looking pup and indeed looks like<br>
your stamp!  Is she going to box with you?  Yoque and I love the card too<br>
and we can totally relate to the Feliz Naughtydog this year.  Kelly<br>
thinks that stripping off one of the boys gloves and bounding off through<br>
the snow with it is a lot of fun.<br>
<br>
~SW, wishing all of you a wonderful Holiday Season!<br>
