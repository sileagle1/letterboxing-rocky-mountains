Letterboxing have a weird affinity for pie and Pirates. I'm not sure <br>
how it all came about, but there you go.  <br>
<br>
That said for the new folks - I just wanted to remind one and all that <br>
September 19th is Talk Like a Pirate Day.   Officially, that is, for <br>
the rest of the landlubbers.  We know it's always TLAP Day here.  <br>
<br>
So avast me hearties!  Get yer booties off the poopdeck and head to the <br>
Talk Like a Pirate website <br>
http://www.talklikeapirate.com/piratehome.html<br>
There's a pirate name generator, and a yardarm of phrases and such for <br>
one and all.  Great fun!  *hoists her grog*<br>
<br>
Don yer pegleg, eyepatch, and parrot and be prepared for a shipload of <br>
pirate posts totally unrelated to letterboxing.  <br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
