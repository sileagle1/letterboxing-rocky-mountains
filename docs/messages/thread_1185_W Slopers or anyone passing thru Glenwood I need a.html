<br>
I was contacted by a geocacher late last week who found my "No Name" <br>
box while looking for a cache.  Turns out the danged cache is 15 feet <br>
away and ALL kinds of folks have found my box instead/in addition.<br>
<br>
I've emailed the cache owner to request s/he at least put a note in <br>
the clues that my box is there (Far as I can tell my box PRE dates the <br>
cache by 10 weeks), but so far have not heard back one way or <br>
another.  <br>
<br>
If I don't get a reply in a week or so, is anyone willing/able to drop <br>
by and maybe find a new hiding spot for it?  OR have any advice on how <br>
to "solve" this little quandry?<br>

my No Name box near Glenwood has a new hiding spot in the same area <br>
a bit farther away from the geocache as of today, 10/15/06.  Thanks <br>
also to Esmerelda for the offer to help me out - but it's all take <br>
care of now - yay!<br>

Please reprint any clues from before this date if you'd like to try <br>
