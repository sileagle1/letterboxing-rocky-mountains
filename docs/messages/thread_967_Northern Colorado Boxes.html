                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did a little maintenance this weekend in Fort Collins.  I put Auntie Stone in a better box (even though she's been in a box for many, many years).  HAHA!  I replaced the Water Wagon in a location that is more accessible year round, and I replaced Joseph Mason in a location near where he was previously but not the exact same place.  I also confirmed that Benjamin Whedbee is exactly where he should be (besides being dead and in the ground), even though a boxer could not find him a couple of weeks ago. I could go on an on with jokes here but I will let you get on with your emails.  Thank you!<br/>

We would be THRILLED to search for a series of clues in the Ft.<br/>
Collins area, as that's certainly driveable from the ranch where we'll<br/>
be staying. Please keep us posted!!<br/>
