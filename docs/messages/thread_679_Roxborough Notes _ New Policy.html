                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all, JeLyBean here.  Hiked Roxborough today, found Hiker's Boot.  <br/>
Thanks Puppy Paws for leaving the Farley Flyer in place.  Tried for <br/>
Fountain Valley, but it appears to have gone missing.  If you <br/>
haven't been, you must go!  Beautiful place!  Also made it by Oh <br/>
Bother (a little wet but we dried it out - great stamp by the way).  <br/>
Now the real news:<br/>
<br/>
I spoke with a very nice Ranger, Heather Poe, who told me Roxborough <br/>
(and other Douglas County state parks) has recently become aware of <br/>
geocaching and letterboxing and has a new policy on letterboxes &amp; <br/>
geocaches.  That policy is, basically, no letterboxes or geocaches <br/>
are allowed in the park.  They know of the boxes &amp; caches that are <br/>
already there and told me they have not removed any (and thus they <br/>
weren't the ones who removed Fountain Valley).  They have taken a <br/>
wait and see approach to the boxes already in the park, essentially <br/>
to see if there is any environmental impact since Roxborough is such <br/>
a sensitive area.  They may remove boxes in the future.  If you have <br/>
boxes there or in other Douglas County state parks, it might benefit <br/>
you to get in touch with the park and discuss their future.  Sounds <br/>
like Roxborough is on the fence right now, they realize letterboxing <br/>
can bring people to the parks, but don't want to impact the <br/>
ecology.  Heather's email is heather(dot)poe(at)state(dot)co(dot)<br/>
us.  I invited Heather to the talk list so she can see what nice, <br/>
environmentally aware and non-threatening people we all are :o)<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't gotten Hiker's Boot or Puma Prints yet, you might <br/>
want to do so before they disappear, and make sure you drop by the <br/>
visitors center and tell them you specifically paid the $5 fee so <br/>
you could find some letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Happy 'Boxing<br/>
