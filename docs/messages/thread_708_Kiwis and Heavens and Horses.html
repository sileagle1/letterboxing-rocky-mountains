maintence this weekend while we're here visiting relatives.<br/>
<br/>
The little Kiwi was indeed gone.. my apologies to anyone who paid <br/>
the entry fee into the park only to come away empty handed.  <br/>
HOWEVER!  I zoomed back to my sister's house, cloned the stamp, used <br/>
an extra journal I had and even as we speak the Kiwi is once again <br/>
camping in his home away from home.  With some very large rocks <br/>
wedging him in and even further out of sight. <br/>
<br/>
New logbook in Harry's Heaven.  The highlight of the day was reading <br/>
the old one which was very full.  One of my favorite entries was <br/>
from an English gentleman who heard about the box while on holiday <br/>
in South Africa and made a point to seek it out when in Colorado!! <br/>
Too fun!<br/>
<br/>
There are a few pages left in Twenty Mile, I'll replace it in a few <br/>
weeks when I return!  <br/>
<br/>
Hope you're all having a wonderful weekend!<br/>
<br/>
Es, going upstairs for pie with the family<br/>
