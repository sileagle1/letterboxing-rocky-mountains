although I probably would have felt underdressed, stamping with such <br/>
fine, fancy, folks as yourselves, Arrr! It's not everyone who can pull <br/>
off wearing a kilt in such style, and the wings, and of course I <br/>
expected nothing less from our own buccaneer's fine wardrobe (*nice <br/>
touch, bringing your ship*)<br/>
<br/>
It's so much fun reading about everyone's different tales of the <br/>
weekend, which made working out here in the heat just a bit cooler.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the fun and keep the tales coming!<br/>
