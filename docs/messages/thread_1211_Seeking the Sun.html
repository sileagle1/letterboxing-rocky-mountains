Jasmine in Palisade!  We visited the boxes down at the riverfront park <br/>
while we (mostly me, don't think she could get a word in edgewise) <br/>
chatted away.  The third box of 'There Were These Two Guys' has just <br/>
been bulldozed up by some overenthusiastic frisbee golf course <br/>
developer... ARRRR!  How RUDE!!  I'll replace it soon.  <br/>
<br/>
She's out finding the rest of the boxes in the freezing cold and I'm <br/>
home scratching.. looks like I caught a cootie.  hehehe.  Garrrr... <br/>
this hobby be a fine one, indeed!<br/>
<br/>
Es, thinking more people should come visit... I have pie!<br/>
