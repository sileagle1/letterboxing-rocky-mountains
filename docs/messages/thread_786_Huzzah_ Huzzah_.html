today and plant another letterbox at the Renaissance faire.  I know, I<br>
know.. the faire is only open two more weekends but, there you go.  My<br>
favorite son, Revman, went with us for the drive and picked right up<br>
on the whole cover up technique.  The new spot isn't as visible as the<br>
old one, but it is still just a few steps off the path and we had<br>
quite a few people walk by during the semi-covert operation.  Rev was<br>
pretty amused that pretending to talk on a cell phone while sitting in<br>
the dirt next to a giant fence kept people from being interested in<br>
what hijinx we were up to.  He pulled his phone out and we double<br>
teamed it while Skeetch hummed a pirate ditty and kicked pine cones<br>
around. <br>
<br>
This is a whole new box.. new clues, new stamp, new journal.  We'll<br>
just retire the first one with a moment of silence and a salute with a<br>
fine eclair.  Arrrrrrrr.<br>
