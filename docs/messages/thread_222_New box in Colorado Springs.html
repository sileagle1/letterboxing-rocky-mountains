Quail Lake<br>
Placed by: Kristen<br>
Placement date: Jun 6 2004<br>
State: Colorado<br>
County: El Paso<br>
Nearest city: Colorado Springs<br>
Number of boxes: 1<br>
<br>
Clues<br>
To get to Quail Lake, take I-25 to Exit 138 (Circle Dr.) Turn right on<br>
Circle Dr. Turn left at the second light, Venetucci. Turn right at the first<br>
light, Cheyenne Mountain Blvd. Follow it till you see a lake on your left.<br>
Turn left on Quail Lake Rd to enter the parking lot. Park in the east lot<br>
for these clues. If this lot is full and you have to park in the west lot,<br>
you'll have to backtrack to the east lot on foot to start the clues.<br>
<br>
Dogs are allowed - please keep them on leash and pick up after them. This<br>
trail is kid friendly, complete with playground and porta-potties. No<br>
swimming allowed. Fishing requires state license. Picnic tables available.<br>
<br>
Note: Number of steps is using both feet (left is 1, right is 2, etc...)<br>
<br>
Clues:<br>
Start at the trail below the east parking lot and walk the trail<br>
counter-clockwise. Pass by 5 park benches. From the 5th park bench, walk 91<br>
steps and notice a sign to your right that says "Log Hop". From here, walk<br>
11 more steps and notice a trail on your right leading up to the apartments.<br>
Do not take this trail.... instead, walk 2 more steps and notice a faint<br>
trail on your left leading down to the lake. This trail is worn through the<br>
grass by the feet of fisherman, so be discrete when searching and stamping,<br>
or they may see you!<br>
<br>
Take the trail down toward the lake to where it crosses a well-defined dirt<br>
trail. Take 2 side steps to your left, and then cross over the dirt trail<br>
and continue down toward the lake about 12 more steps, over a small<br>
embankment. On your left, you will see a tree stump with tangled roots. Find<br>
the micro-box underneath the roots, hidden by a rock.<br>
<br>
Enjoy the lake! Thanks for visiting....<br>

  Seven Bridges<br>
  Placed by: Kristen<br>
  Placement date: Jul 10 2004<br>
  State: Colorado<br>
  County: El Paso<br>
  Nearest city: Colorado Springs<br>
  Number of boxes: 1<br>
<br>
  Clues<br>
  Difficulty: Moderate<br>
  Distance: 4.5 miles round trip<br>
  Elevation: 7,600  8,800<br>
  Kid-Friendly: No  its long and a lot of unsure footing<br>
  Dog Friendly: Yes  keep dogs on leash<br>
<br>
  You will need sturdy hiking boots, flashlight, and a glove or something to<br>
protect your hand when you reach into the crevice. Might want to pick up a<br>
stick along the way to poke into the hole in case critters are in there.<br>
Pack a lunch and blanket if you want to have a picnic by the babbling creek.<br>
<br>
  Directions: Exit I-25 at Hwy 24 and take 24 west to 21st St. Turn left<br>
(south) on 21st St. (which becomes Cresta along the way) approximately 3<br>
miles until you come to the stoplight at Cheyenne Blvd. Turn right (west)<br>
onto Cheyenne Blvd. (which becomes Cheyenne Rd. along the way) and go<br>
approximately 1 mile until you come to the Starsmore Discovery Center (2120<br>
W. Cheyenne Rd.) at the entrance to North Cheyenne Caon Rd. Turn right onto<br>
North Cheyenne Caon Rd. and reset your trip odometer.<br>
<br>
  At the 0.4-0.5 mile mark, look up and youll see some great rock<br>
formations looming ahead of you. 2.5 miles marks Helen Hunt Falls and the<br>
Visitors Center, which has some good educational displays. There are also<br>
porta-potties here. Continue past the parking lot up a switchback road and<br>
at 3.1 miles, come to a dirt parking lot. Park here. You may meet a giant<br>
Husky dog that runs free here... the park knows about him and hes friendly.<br>
He wont bother you except to lay down in the shade behind your car so you<br>
cant leave.<br>
<br>
  This trail is called Seven Bridges because youll be crossing.... seven<br>
bridges! There is an additional bridge that is mostly hidden by foliage, but<br>
it does not connect with the trail, so if you see it, disregard it.<br>
<br>
  Note: Number of steps is using both feet (left is 1, right is 2, etc...)<br>
<br>
  Start your hike on the dirt road on the northwest side of the parking lot.<br>
After a while, youll see two tall brown pipes sticking up on your right<br>
side, and then a sign that says No vehicle use off this road. At this<br>
point you can hear the creek and the trailhead is not far. Walk on the road<br>
until it crosses the creek. 25 steps further, youll see a trail off to the<br>
right. Take it, and youll see a rusted sign designating it North Cheyenne<br>
Canyon Creek trail, which is what it used to be called.<br>
<br>
  Follow the trail along the creek and cross the first bridge which is<br>
really just a rickety-looking board that lies across the water. Theres a<br>
clearing here where you can put down a blanket and have a picnic lunch right<br>
next to the creek. From the 1st bridge, take a reading of 52 degrees and<br>
follow that to ensure youre on the right trail. It should be almost<br>
directly ahead of you. When you get to a split, go left and see a sign that<br>
says No motor vehicles.<br>
<br>
  Cross 2nd bridge  has railings<br>
  Cross 3rd bridge  no railings<br>
  Cross 4th bridge  has railings<br>
  Cross 5th bridge  has railings<br>
  Cross 6th bridge  has railings<br>
<br>
  After you step off the 6th bridge, take 15 steps and on your left you will<br>
see a large rock wedged peculiarly against a tree.<br>
<br>
  41 more steps and you will see a large tree that had fallen across the<br>
trail, and was cut through to allow passage<br>
<br>
  41 more steps after that, and you will see a monstrous boulder on the<br>
left, looming over the trail. On the right side of the boulder as you face<br>
it, theres a space where you can walk underneath it. Theres a pile of<br>
rocks underneath  the letterbox is hidden behind/under the largest of<br>
these. Use a flashlight to peer into the hole in case critters have set up<br>
house.<br>
<br>
  This trail is pretty busy so youll have to be discrete looking for the<br>
box and stamping in. Please make sure when you put the box back that it<br>
doesnt fall out of reach. Dont forget to continue on to find the 7th<br>
bridge (no railings). The trail continues past that, but I always turn back<br>
there. Be careful on the way down, footing can be bad.<br>
<br>
  On your way back, why not stop and check out the letterbox at Helen Hunt<br>
Falls/Silver Cascade Falls?<br>
