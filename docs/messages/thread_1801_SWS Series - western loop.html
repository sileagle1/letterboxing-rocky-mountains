I spent the week doing maintenance on the 11 boxes on the western loop of the SWS series.  All the boxes are back, although I had to recarve and replant some of them in new locations.  One of my spots was taken over by a geocacher!<br/>
<br/>
So, if you haven't done the series, reprint the clues to make sure you are looking in the right places.  AND, be careful of snakes and poison ivy.  The grasses are really high this year due to all the rain we've been having.<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>

I'll be checking and replaning boxes on the eastern side (east of Kipling) next week.<br/>
