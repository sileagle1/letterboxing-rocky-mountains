this evening's update to fill in the blanks. I pulled off the road <br/>
when they came on the radio...but I still missed one of them. Anyway, <br/>
here they are:<br/>
<br/>
1. North of Tuba City to Fair Dealing.<br/>
<br/>
2. South of 240<br/>
<br/>
3. Montrose east to Bernalillo.<br/>
<br/>
4. West of 234<br/>
<br/>
5. The Frosty.......(I will have to wait 'till tomorrow for the rest <br/>
of this one).<br/>
<br/>
6. Bayfield zip minus 1679. (Okay, Bayfield is 81122 which leaves us <br/>
with 79443...we have a phone number prefix that ends in 7, so I <br/>
looked up 247-9443 and it is a private residence...poor guy).<br/>
<br/>
7. Hop right above it. (I was thinking a dance studio is above the <br/>
location?? I could use other ideas).<br/>
<br/>
8. Walk in the direction that the walking man just came from. (???)<br/>
<br/>
9. Remember when the Bullet was downtown? (I know it has been hidden <br/>
downtown for the last two years, maybe this means it isn't this year?)<br/>
<br/>
10. Turn at the light just before the river, park at the third light <br/>
after that. (Believe me, I'm running through the possibilities, but <br/>
there are four main river crossings in Durango.)<br/>
<br/>
And then there was a bonus clue announced that I had to pick up at a <br/>
local coffee shop--- When you find the Bullet please be careful. The <br/>

need to walk in the direction opposite the way the figure in the sign <br/>

#6 could be a street address?<br/>

Great ideas...keep 'em coming.<br/>
<br/>
That number, 79443, is just too big for me to make an adress out of. <br/>
7944 3rd Ave would require Durango to have a 79th street and we only <br/>
go up to the thirties. I'm not saying it isn't an adress, just that <br/>
I can't figure out where it would be.<br/>
<br/>
Crosswalk walking men always go right when your facing them, I think.<br/>
<br/>
We don't have an IHOP but you got me thinking that we DO have a <br/>
Kangaroo Express.<br/>
<br/>
Last year the Bullet was hidden in a porta-pottie, the year before <br/>
that it was hidden under an outdoor table at a Tai restaurant. SO <br/>
following your ideas...it could be near a public restroom? near a <br/>
table?<br/>
<br/>
Clue #11--- In a roundabout way Big 5 Sports and Gardenschwartz <br/>
(another sporting goods store) could lead you there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all the ideas, hopefully a light bulb will turn on <br/>
and put me out of my sweet misery.<br/>

what happens with 9443-7th ave in reality?  Mapquest keeps showing me <br/>

Also, when I Google "bullet downtown Durango" I get a hit on: <br/>

"The Diamond Belle Saloon opened its doors in 1957 and has a bullet <br/>
hole in the far east drawer behind the bar." which I note is at Main <br/>
and 7th (I've actually been there).  I don't think that date is right <br/>

there?<br/>

and 7th because that is as high as the numbers go. I never thought <br/>
of the telephone pad...brilliant!<br/>
<br/>
The thing that is "hoppy" in the Diamond Belle is the beer. I also <br/>
thought "hoppy" might refer to one of our four micro-breweries.<br/>

The last clue I got was:<br/>

14. Beware of the Cobras and Sharks.<br/>
<br/>
There have been a lot of "sports" type references so I am going to <br/>
cruise by the hocky rink and a tennis court on the way home. Just to <br/>
see if something rings a bell. And a spin through downtown to see if <br/>
anything looks familiar there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the pirate cheer,<br/>

Oh Y!  How about this for the Cobras and sharks...Texas Hold'em is so <br/>
popular now, is there any casinos or bars that host it?  I'm thinking <br/>
SNAKE EYES for Cobra and SHARKS are well, Card Sharks!  Whatcha' <br/>
think?  <br/>
