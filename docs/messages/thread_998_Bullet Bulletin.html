                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry Kat...I..um...missed a couple of clues and had to wait until <br>
this evening's update to fill in the blanks. I pulled off the road <br>
when they came on the radio...but I still missed one of them. Anyway, <br>
here they are:<br>
<br>
1. North of Tuba City to Fair Dealing.<br>
<br>
2. South of 240<br>
<br>
3. Montrose east to Bernalillo.<br>
<br>
4. West of 234<br>
<br>
5. The Frosty.......(I will have to wait 'till tomorrow for the rest <br>
of this one).<br>
<br>
6. Bayfield zip minus 1679. (Okay, Bayfield is 81122 which leaves us <br>
with 79443...we have a phone number prefix that ends in 7, so I <br>
looked up 247-9443 and it is a private residence...poor guy).<br>
<br>
7. Hop right above it. (I was thinking a dance studio is above the <br>
location?? I could use other ideas).<br>
<br>
8. Walk in the direction that the walking man just came from. (???)<br>
<br>
9. Remember when the Bullet was downtown? (I know it has been hidden <br>
downtown for the last two years, maybe this means it isn't this year?)<br>
<br>
10. Turn at the light just before the river, park at the third light <br>
after that. (Believe me, I'm running through the possibilities, but <br>
there are four main river crossings in Durango.)<br>
<br>
And then there was a bonus clue announced that I had to pick up at a <br>
local coffee shop--- When you find the Bullet please be careful. The <br>
Bullet is enclosed in a priceless piece of homemade artwork.<br>
<br>
These clues seem a little easier than last year so I'm thinking it <br>
will be found sooner. Just a hunch.<br>

need to walk in the direction opposite the way the figure in the sign <br>

#6 could be a street address?<br>

<br>
Great ideas...keep 'em coming.<br>
<br>
That number, 79443, is just too big for me to make an adress out of. <br>
7944 3rd Ave would require Durango to have a 79th street and we only <br>
go up to the thirties. I'm not saying it isn't an adress, just that <br>
I can't figure out where it would be.<br>
<br>
Crosswalk walking men always go right when your facing them, I think.<br>
<br>
We don't have an IHOP but you got me thinking that we DO have a <br>
Kangaroo Express.<br>
<br>
Last year the Bullet was hidden in a porta-pottie, the year before <br>
that it was hidden under an outdoor table at a Tai restaurant. SO <br>
following your ideas...it could be near a public restroom? near a <br>
table?<br>
<br>
Clue #11--- In a roundabout way Big 5 Sports and Gardenschwartz <br>
(another sporting goods store) could lead you there.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for all the ideas, hopefully a light bulb will turn on <br>
and put me out of my sweet misery.<br>

This is long shot y, since I've only been to Durango a few times, and I <br>
can't tell on Mapquest where I end up, but....<br>
<br>
what happens with 9443-7th ave in reality?  Mapquest keeps showing me <br>
two possibilites, both are near rivers, one looks to actually be <br>
on "riverbend" and one is the Animas....<br>
<br>
Also, when I Google "bullet downtown Durango" I get a hit on: <br>
<br>
"The Diamond Belle Saloon opened its doors in 1957 and has a bullet <br>
hole in the far east drawer behind the bar." which I note is at Main <br>
and 7th (I've actually been there).  I don't think that date is right <br>
but I know the saloon is downtown...Is there anything "hoppy" around <br>
there?<br>

The thing that is "hoppy" in the Diamond Belle is the beer. I also <br>
thought "hoppy" might refer to one of our four micro-breweries.<br>

There have been a lot of "sports" type references so I am going to <br>
cruise by the hocky rink and a tennis court on the way home. Just to <br>
see if something rings a bell. And a spin through downtown to see if <br>
anything looks familiar there.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the pirate cheer,<br>

Oh Y!  How about this for the Cobras and sharks...Texas Hold'em is so <br>
popular now, is there any casinos or bars that host it?  I'm thinking <br>
SNAKE EYES for Cobra and SHARKS are well, Card Sharks!  Whatcha' <br>
think?  <br>

2 year old grandson for the day and he kept me Oh So Busy!).<br>
