<br/>
I really like this idea.  Since permitting will take so long, it will be<br/>
impossible for visitors to find a spot, wait for a permit and then go<br/>
and plant the box.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe 48-72 hours from planting (that would cover Friday/Weekend<br/>
planters) and if denied picked up within 7 days of denial.  (that gives<br/>
you a weekend to get your box back).<br/>
<br/>
I think this may be a good thing to try and accomplish.  I am in.<br/>

I'm doing some thinking about this permit things and there seem to <br/>
be a lot of restrictions.  We often carry around letterboxes waiting <br/>
to be placed in case we find a cool spot that speaks to us.  Just as <br/>
with out-of-towners, the permit makes it difficult to make these <br/>
kind of placements.  I'm wondering if there is another way.<br/>
<br/>
