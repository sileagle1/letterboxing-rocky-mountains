calendar for the 10th and 11th to make sure that I wasn't missing<br>

night!  I can't believe this!<br>
<br>
Now, be it known.  At this point there is little short of death that<br>
could stop me from going to the gathering.  I will not miss it, but it<br>
is about an eight hour drive from here.  I was so looking forward to<br>
going after my earlier committment on Sat morning and boxing on the<br>
way down along with camping that night.  I don't think I would do well<br>
with trying to do it all on Sunday morning.  I think I will have to<br>
head out on Saturday night after my concert is over--I will skip the<br>
usual shmoozing we do afterwords with the patrons.  Then I will have<br>
to stay in Salt Lake and get up early in the morning to finish the<br>
drive.<br>
<br>
This is going to be a bit of a pain and it totally puts kinks in my<br>
plans for driving and boxing.  Aryn, it looks like you may want to go<br>
down earlier after all and meet up with others.  I'm so sad!  I may<br>
have to just bring my stuff along and see if anyone has room for one<br>
more tent at their site when I get to the gathering.<br>

Oh, No!! What terrible news! But I am so happy that you still plan on <br>
coming to Gathering. My boys and I will need to head back to Durango on <br>
Sunday evening because of their school on Monday. But one plan might be <br>
for us to basically give our campsite to you. That way you wouldn't <br>
have to worry about finding one right when you get into town on Sunday.<br>
<br>
Another option, that you mentioned before, would be to get a group <br>
site. I think the only ones still open for those two nights are at Gold <br>
Bar on Potash Road (very close to two letterboxes). These are kind of <br>
in the open, although the group sites are in the Tamarisks a little <br>
more if I remember right. Anyway, the charge is $10 plus $2 per person, <br>
and you have to pay for the minimum of 15 people. So, 40 dollars a <br>
night would get us a BIG site.<br>
<br>
If there are enough others that are interested in this, I would like to <br>
go in on it. But I will only be there for Saturday night. I can arrange <br>
this today. Tomorrow, I'm headed down the backpacking trail so I won't <br>
be able to help with arrangements.<br>

Oh, no!! What a monkey wrench thrown into your plans!<br>
<br>
I am delighted that you are still going to come to the gathering<br>
though. That's a lot of driving in a short time. Please be careful and<br>
plan some rest stops. Too bad you won't be able to box and plant along<br>
the way, but I guess this time it IS the destination and not the<br>
journey. I'll be thinking about you and a safe trip.<br>
