Hiya all you pie lovers!!  I'll give anyone, erm.......a FREE SMILE! <br/>
if they can even BEGIN to 'splain me this pie thing.  I'm told no one <br/>
really remembers how it started.  Surely (shirley?) someone can at <br/>
least attempt it?<br/>

We Catamount Carvers love history!  It's a favorite subject!<br/>
<br/>
If you've got a little time to burn, just search for the word PIE in the<br/>
archives.  It will provide a complete history of pie in the world of<br/>
Rocky Mountain Letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
I will tell you that the first message with reference to pie turns up on<br/>
August 17, 2004 and it was Esmerelda.  No surprise is it?<br/>
<br/>
In reference to the Onion I, she says ...<br/>
<br/>
"I even tried bribing him with pie and a complimentary beverage.<br/>
nada. evil. evil I tell you.<br/>
<br/>
Esmerelda, weeping giant onion-induced tears"<br/>
<br/>
On October 25, 2004, Esmerelda replies to Aljan's mention of getting<br/>
Dragonfruit at a Trader's Joe and says,<br/>
<br/>
"I haven't tasted it. I'm waiting for a report. But next time I get<br/>
to the Trader's I'll pick some up and let y'all know if pirates like<br/>
Dragonfruit. I know they like pie."<br/>
<br/>
It just builds and gets more and more out of control from there.  Now you<br/>
could argue that pie came up with Eoghan's RC Cola and Moon Pie boxes,<br/>
but let's face it ... does any one really consider that pie?  I think we<br/>
can squarely place blame for this RMLetterboxing obsession with our<br/>
favorite pirate ... Esmerelda!<br/>

<br/>
So... I'm supposed, erm, burn the pie, after I add onions, right (or <br/>
is it add onions and then burn it!!?? <winks>  I think I also "get" <br/>
that drinking something is or was involved, and stopping by Trader <br/>
Joes is in order...long trip to one of those from Denver.....<br/>
<br/>
I had definitely "gotten" that the pie thing's been building for <br/>
awhile and gotten "outta control" and it's been cracking me up for <br/>
weeks as I've been lurking.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<can (sarcastic).="" <br="" a="" be="" found="" have="" i="" might="" new="" quite="" sarky="" think="">
hang out! wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee<br/>

Thanks for ALL the responses, encouragement, and welcomes - on and <br/>
off list!!<br/>
