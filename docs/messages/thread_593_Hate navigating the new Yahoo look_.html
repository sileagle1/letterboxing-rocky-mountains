I'm hearing from more and more people that they hate this new look.<br/>
My suggestion -- send out the message below to the other Yahoo<br/>
groups you belong to. My sense is if people really do hate this new<br/>
look, they will keep spreading the message, people will keep joining<br/>
this new group, and... we'll get noticed for sure. I mean, how<br/>
could they ignore a group with hundreds or thousands of members<br/>
called the "We Hate The Yahoo Groups New Look Group"?<br/>
<br/>
And if people don't spread it... well, heck, maybe they like it, and<br/>
we're just crumugeons... ;)<br/>

HATE THE YAHOO GROUP NEW LOOK? SPREAD THE WORD!<br/>
***********************************************<br/>
<br/>
Please join our new Yahoo group:<br/>
"We Hate The Yahoo Groups New Look Group"<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Wehatethenewlook/<br/>
<br/>
We like Yahoo, we like Yahoo Groups, but... we are unanimous in our<br/>
disdain for the Yahoo Groups "new look." We are confused by the<br/>
navigation, the pastels, and well... the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
Together, we are begging Yahoo to please, please, please revert to<br/>
the old look, or at least revise this one to make it more user<br/>
friendly once again.<br/>
<br/>
Please join our group, and help us amplify our message of hate for<br/>
the Yahoo Groups new look. Help us make a difference. Help us end<br/>
the hurting.<br/>
