I emailed the placer and she said she would check on it.  She at that time changed the clue to show "reported missing".  I assume that if it is no longer in the clues then she must have checked and it was indeed missing.  She probably did not replace it because as Autumn once reported that she thought it was not legal to place lboxes or gcaches in Boulder/or maybe Boulder county.<br/>

  Hi all - does anyone know if Colorado Columbine in Boulder is still <br/>
