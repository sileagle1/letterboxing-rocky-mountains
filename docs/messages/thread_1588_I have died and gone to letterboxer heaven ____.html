                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am hopping up and down - making that funny "squeeeee" noise that my <br>
boyfriend associates with anything I find super exciting.<br>
<br>
I just opened my mail.  *hop hop hop*<br>
<br>
Okay - let me back up a bit in my story.  While the Fellowship of the <br>
Two was making the Ascent of Mount Doom, a serious tragedy occurred.  <br>
My old signature stamp fell down into the pit, consumed by the Eye of <br>
Sauron.  It melted away just like the One Ring (only maybe not so <br>
dramatically - I mean - like no mountains exploded)..  <br>
<br>
Now, as any of you who have seen my boxes can attest, I'm a pretty <br>
craptastic carver.  So just imagine how ecstatic I was to get an <br>
email from one of our MASTER carvers - Ravenwolf - offering to carve <br>
ME a new siggy stamp?  I seriously about fell over in my office <br>
chair.  Seriously, Me?!  Whoop!<br>
<br>
So Ravenwolf and Aljan Sundance pooled their artistic heads, and drew <br>
and carved me the most spectacular new Signature Stamp.  I just <br>
opened my mail and I swear my neighbors came out to see if I was <br>
okay.  These two have created something I could never have dreamed <br>
up.  I'm beyond thrilled.  Aljan's art and Ravenwolf's carving?  It <br>
is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen on pink stuff.  *swoons*<br>
So all ya'll that have my old sig stamp as an exchange?  Um hmmm ... <br>
we need to hook up and swap again, because this stamp is just <br>
amazing!!  <br>
<br>
Thank you, thank you, a million times thank you to Ravenwolf and <br>
Aljan for my new siggy stamp which is soooo cool I'm seriously <br>
hopping and squee-ing with glee!  *hop hop hop*<br>

Seriously, though, if I thought that losing my sig stamp would net me an Aljan/Ravenwolf creation to replace it, it would have met its demise a long, long time ago.  I'm dying to Autumn's beautiful new stamp!<br>

Oh, you are so very welcome.  I had a great time and was psyched and <br>
all in when RavenWolf asked if I wanted to play.  *raises hand and <br>
jumps up and down, me, me, pick ME!*<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
