Well, I'm a total cheapskate, so I haven't ever stayed in a hotel in <br/>
Telluride. I do know that they go from pricey to outrageous during <br/>
any of the festivals. But I think the last one is the Blues and <br/>
Brews Festival next weekend and the prices go down after that.<br/>
<br/>
As far as camping, my favorite is the Matterhorn Campground up <br/>
towards Lizard Head Pass...very picturesque. But the Ilium Creek <br/>
Campground is closer to town. Both of these are Forest Service <br/>
Campgrounds without showers. I've heard that there is a campground <br/>
in town by the park with showers, but you might as well be in a <br/>
hotel for the fee they charge.<br/>
<br/>
This person might also consider staying at the Mountain Village. <br/>
There is a free Gondola that runs between downtown and Mountain <br/>
Village and is kinda fun (even if you aren't staying up there).<br/>
<br/>
There is only one letterbox I know of: Fall and Falls in Telluride <br/>
by Kat. This is a great box after a nice hike to a special place <br/>
with awesome views....highly recommended. Lots of other good hiking <br/>
trails start basically in town. There is a visitor's center on the <br/>
right as you enter town that has brochures about hikes and other fun <br/>
stuff. In a couple of weeks the Aspen might even be changing.<br/>
<br/>
Es or Kat or someone else might have a better idea of the hotels or <br/>
places to go.<br/>
<br/>
Would I know this mysterious traveler?<br/>
