Another boxer reported:  "the log book was damp. Wish I had a new one to leave. I don't think the ziplock bag was sealed well by previous finder. Hope it doesn't mildew in the well sealed bag now."<br>
<br>
We may be up there this Fall, but if anyone is going up there sooner, a new dry logbook for Blackvelvets box would be awesome!  And, if you can bring down her old log book and send it to her once it's dried out, that would be the icing on the cake!<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
Hugs, Peach  p.s.  we planted the box for Blackvelvet a LONG time ago...it's been a very active box!<br>
