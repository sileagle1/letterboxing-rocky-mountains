&gt; The original PZcut that I had was white, but I only had a small <br/>

a <br/>

&gt; 4x4!<br/>
&gt; It's soft as buttuh.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Jodi, Es may very well have the same stuff that you have.  They <br/>
did <br/>
&gt; not change the color from white to orange until a couple of months <br/>
&gt; ago.  I bought up about 5 sheets of the white before they were gone <br/>
&gt; because I didn't want that glowing stamp material.  However, if the <br/>
&gt; stuff she has is in fact made by speedball, it does suck.  PZcut <br/>
has <br/>
&gt; to be purcahsed online so if Es purcahsed it at the store, it <br/>
likely <br/>
&gt; is speedball.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I suspect that we are talking about different white stuff.  I <br/>
think <br/>
&gt; the stuff that I have is by Speedball, same company as the pink <br/>
&gt; stuff.  But it sucks and the pink stuff doesn't.<br/>

talking <br/>

It really does carve like buttuh. That PZCut is really nice too. The <br/>

Gee, thanks for the huge compliment.  I, Silent Wings (head journal maker<br/>
of the Catamounts), must tell you that Yoque is the head carver at our<br/>
house.  Even if I design the stamp, he carves it.  His first stamps were<br/>
done with pink eraser and a pocket knife and I like them a whole lot!  I<br/>
just think that he can carve with about anything and in any material.  I,<br/>
on the other hand, get frustrated and the thought of buttuh and cream<br/>
cheese ... I can hardly believe it!  Yes Es, it just might bring tears to<br/>
my eyes!<br/>
