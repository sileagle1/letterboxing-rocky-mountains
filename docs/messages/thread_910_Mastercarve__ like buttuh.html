It really does carve like buttuh. That PZCut is really nice too. The <br>

Gee, thanks for the huge compliment.  I, Silent Wings (head journal maker<br>
of the Catamounts), must tell you that Yoque is the head carver at our<br>
house.  Even if I design the stamp, he carves it.  His first stamps were<br>
done with pink eraser and a pocket knife and I like them a whole lot!  I<br>
just think that he can carve with about anything and in any material.  I,<br>
on the other hand, get frustrated and the thought of buttuh and cream<br>
cheese ... I can hardly believe it!  Yes Es, it just might bring tears to<br>
my eyes!<br>
