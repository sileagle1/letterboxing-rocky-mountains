                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just this evening, The H-A's replaced our first letterbox, which <br>
disappeared back in June.  Dilbox has a new stamp and new journal, so <br>
even if you stamped in before, you may want to stop by again to get <br>
the new image.<br>
<br>
As a bonus, we also place a new box in the same vicinity called "Give <br>
Me a Hand."  Its not a far trek to visit both in the same trip.<br>
<br>
We are hoping to get "Have a Homebrew" back out next weekend, so <br>
you'll be able to pick up all three in one visit, if you feel like <br>
waiting.<br>
<br>
Welcome, Front Range Hiker!  Hoped you'd be posting soon.  Sounds like <br>
you had as much fun up in Grand Lake as we did.  Hope that encourages <br>
a few of the other members to head up there soon or we'll have to do a <br>
meet up there in the spring.<br>
