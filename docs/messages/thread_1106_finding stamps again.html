<br/>
On a roll. Found a friend who likes hiking and I like letterboxing. <br/>
Works out well. <br/>
<br/>
Hope to look for another one this week. I would love to do the ones in <br/>
Dartmoor one year. Like A vacation of letterboxing. Sounds cool.<br/>

You should check the archives of the NorCal group, or get in touch<br/>
with Princess Lea, Amanda from Seattle or Green Tortuga, who went<br/>
to Dartmoor recently. I, too, had held it up as a holy grail (and<br/>
I do think that would be a cool part of the world to visit), but<br/>
have *gone off* the idea a bit since hearing some of their reports.<br/>
I guess the Brits' idea of letterboxing is a little different than<br/>
ours, and for someone who must have a hand-carved stamp (no matter<br/>
how crude, really), the pickins' are a little lean there. I love<br/>
the creativity that goes into most boxes here and would find myself<br/>
very disappointed indeed to be surrounded by thousands of boxes<br/>
all with sad commercial stamps in them. Water, water everywhere...<br/>
<br/>
My Lb vacation wish list is mostly domestic: San Luis Obispo, CA;<br/>
upstate NY; Portland, OR, to name a few. And for you RM boxers, how<br/>
about a side trip to Lake Tahoe? Sure is lovely this time of year!<br/>
<br/>
aT, wishing Es or some other RMb in the know would clue me in<br/>
regarding pirates and pie.;) <br/>
