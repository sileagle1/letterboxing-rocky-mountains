                    <div class="plaintext-content">There were two 'boxes in Union Station (Rocky Mountain Choo Choo and <br/>
Hobo Signs: Gentlemen) at one point.  I'm not giving anything away <br/>
since there were not mystery-ish boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I think the clues for both are not up at this point since one had a <br/>
missing stamp for the longest time and the other one..well I think <br/>
it went missing.  I'm not 100% sure since they're not my boxes, but <br/>
having the names might help you in your hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad - they were fun sneaky indoor boxes good for weather like <br/>
we've had lately.<br/>
<br/>
So no you weren't dreaming :-)<br/>
