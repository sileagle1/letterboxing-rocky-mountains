We stopped at French Ingots so they could stamp in and noticed that the <br/>
site around the box had changed. Since I haven't been able to contact <br/>
Jacobi, I just thought I would let everyone know that it is still <br/>
there, even though the trees it was originally hidden by have fallen <br/>
down. I hope it's okay that I posted this, and Jacobi, please send me a <br/>
note if you read this.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we had the greatest time, although this time of year in the <br/>
mountains, an early start is the key to stamping in before the rains.<br/>
