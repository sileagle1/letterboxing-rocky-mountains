really searched the entire compound.  We suspect that some boxers were<br>
in a hurry to leave and didn't wait until no one was around to rehide<br>
it and were seen.  There were about 127 people 10 feet away from the<br>

I just happened to have brought along another box and it is now hidden<br>
safely far from the madding crowd.  I'll post the clues asap.  It's an<br>
entirely new box.. new journal.. new stamp of a new image.  I consider<br>
it another find for anyone who's been to the old one because, well,<br>
it's all new and in a new spot!  Woot!<br>
