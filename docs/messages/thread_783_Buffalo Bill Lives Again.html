Buffalo Bill was indeed gone.  No sign of any part of it anywhere.. we<br/>
really searched the entire compound.  We suspect that some boxers were<br/>
in a hurry to leave and didn't wait until no one was around to rehide<br/>
it and were seen.  There were about 127 people 10 feet away from the<br/>
spot while we were there.. the tourists are out in force!!  No<br/>
Springer Spaniels in sight, but someone did have an Irish Wolfhound. <br/>
But I digress.   <br/>

I just happened to have brought along another box and it is now hidden<br/>
safely far from the madding crowd.  I'll post the clues asap.  It's an<br/>
entirely new box.. new journal.. new stamp of a new image.  I consider<br/>
it another find for anyone who's been to the old one because, well,<br/>
it's all new and in a new spot!  Woot!<br/>
