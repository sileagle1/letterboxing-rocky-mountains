                    <div class="plaintext-content">Y!!!!!  I checked the radio website and the second clue actually <br>
reads:  I'm thinking of a number between CHOO AND NEIGH.  If ye talks <br>
like a Pirate could it translate to English, as TWO AND MAIN??? Or, <br>
between the Train (choo) and the Wild Horse (neigh).  At any rate, I <br>
think it's gotta be at the ORE HOUSE!  Somewhere!!!  SEEK, SCOUNDREL, <br>

<br>
#3-A number between CHOO and NEIGH. Could they be saying a number <br>
between U and A? As on a map? Of dUrAngo? I like the train/horse idea <br>
better but this still seemed like something worth looking into.<br>
<br>
#9-How would you say this in Spanish? THIS in Spanish would be ESTE or <br>
ESTO or ESTA. Como se dice esto en espanol? I don't see how this helps <br>
but you never know!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Astro D!  Your ideas are very interesting.  I went to the Radio site <br>
to view the clues and thought it was curious that they put in caps only <br>
certain words (besides the beginning of the sentence:  T' AFT O' T' M; <br>
CHOO NEIGH; "T" in treasure; "W" in watched.  If you add "R" from your <br>
interpretation of 3-A and ESTE or ESTA, I'm wondering if we can anagram <br>
the site of the treasure???  Now, it could just be they are in caps for <br>
emphasis, but, I wonder....<br>
<br>
Just thinkin.....for Dreadly, this is a scary thought!<br>
