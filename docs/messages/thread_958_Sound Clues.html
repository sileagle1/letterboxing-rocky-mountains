                    <div class="plaintext-content">Es is referring to the Big Brain Box, whose clues are a mini-CD that <br/>
floats around from box to box like cuckoo clues.  However, you don't <br/>
need any special software for that, they should play in a normal CD <br/>
player.<br/>
<br/>
I think most people who have a computer these days have some kind of <br/>
media player, although which one is a different story.  If you're <br/>
going to go the media player route, I suggest you make sure the <br/>
sound clip is available in a few of the major formats.<br/>

&gt; Garrrr.. there be a 'sounds only' set of clues sailing around out <br/>
&gt; there.  They hurt my brain.  And their ship flies the JelyRoger. <br/>

&gt; &gt; I'm having fun tonight thinking of ways to work in the wonderful <br/>
&gt; &gt; clue/location ideas you have all given me on this thread! :-) <br/>
(and <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm Cracker-ing myself up...often)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In doing so, I even found a related food idea for a box less <br/>
than a <br/>
&gt; &gt; mile from my house... <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So, anyway I have a question....has anyone used sound either for <br/>
&gt; &gt; your clues when placing a box, or had to listen to in order to <br/>
find <br/>
&gt; &gt; a box location?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I found something really ...Grate ...online which would require <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; use of either Real Player or Windows Media Player and it would <br/>
be <br/>
&gt; &gt; necessary to listen to get part of the clues. (there isn't a <br/>
print <br/>
&gt; &gt; version I can find), but what's "in this sound" is IMHO, really <br/>
&gt; &gt; worth it, and it really fits with the Homage to Fromage theme!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; What's your opinion on this idea of incorporating sound?  <br/>
&gt; Especially <br/>
&gt; &gt; about whether you think most boxers would actually be able to <br/>
&gt; access <br/>
&gt; &gt; it.  Or by using sound, would I basically be making my box <br/>
&gt; &gt; inaccessible to some/many boxers?  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I should mention, that at this point in my thinking, this box <br/>
would <br/>
&gt; &gt; have clues you'd have to work on in advance before you hit the <br/>
road <br/>
&gt; &gt; anyway, in addition to this sound idea.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thoughts?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I really DO appreciate all the help and ideas!  Those of you <br/>
&gt; willing <br/>
&gt; &gt; to get into the punny-ness of all things cheesy for this <br/>
relative <br/>
&gt; &gt; newbie is very encouraging!  I hope I'll come up with something <br/>
&gt; &gt; worthy of all your assistance.<br/>
