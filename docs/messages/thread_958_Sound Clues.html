                    <div class="plaintext-content">Es is referring to the Big Brain Box, whose clues are a mini-CD that <br>
floats around from box to box like cuckoo clues.  However, you don't <br>
need any special software for that, they should play in a normal CD <br>
player.<br>
<br>
I think most people who have a computer these days have some kind of <br>
media player, although which one is a different story.  If you're <br>
going to go the media player route, I suggest you make sure the <br>
sound clip is available in a few of the major formats.<br>
