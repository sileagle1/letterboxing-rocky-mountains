                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Rocky Mtn. LBers.  We Great Lakes LBers are starting a series<br>
called "The I-94 Traffic Crawl".  Many of us have taken long,<br>
frustrating drives through Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis or other<br>
areas along I-94 and are anxious to create some diversion.  I've<br>
driven I-94 from start to finish and know the problems in ND and MT<br>
are quite different from Chicagoland.  Would anyone be interested in<br>
putting a box or two somewhere between Billings and Fargo?<br>
<br>
Here's the info I gave to the Great Lakes board:<br>
<br>
Let's call the thing "The I-94 Traffic Crawl" and prefix the boxes<br>
accordingly (e.g. "The I-94 Traffic Crawl: Gary, IN". THEME: Just<br>
play off the word "crawl" and think "traffic" - we've all been there,<br>
right? Try and tie it in to your location somehow. Keep things a<br>
mile or two off the freeway and send us somewhere interesting. We<br>
need stimulation after staring at brake lights (or endless hills in<br>
eastern MT).<br>
<br>
Submit ideas and locations to me off-list and I'll make sure we avoid<br>
duplicates.<br>
<br>
Let's also try to avoid the Oases (in Chicago) since a few people are<br>
already headed in that direction. Get us off the freeway!<br>
<br>
It would be great to have all the major cities represented as well as<br>
the start and end points of the freeway.  (We're particularly looking<br>
for one near the Billings West End of I-94.)<br>
<br>
This should be interesting and make our driving fun. I'm starting to<br>
look forward to my next MI or Minneapolis trip. When you travel this<br>
route, think about adding a box at a rest stop or park.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to your emails and ideas,<br>
M Clan<br>
