Can someone give me the website for the LB by post office?  My sister, <br>
Kitty Lady, says she wants to do this since she lives in a small town <br>
and has found everything near her. Some of you may remember her at the <br>
gathering - she did not feel well and didn't say too much, but enjoyed <br>
seeing what Letterboxers look like in person!!!  <br>
<br>
Boxerlover - I looked on the HH you gave me and it has an email addr <br>
where I can contact them about progress - so, I'll do it. Thanks <br>
anyway.  It's a cute idea about the birthday candles. <br>

I do remember Kitty Lady, the very first one I met at Moab, and she's<br>
from OK, where I was born and raised! I, too, have run out of LBs to<br>
find in my area and so am active in the postal aspect of the hobby.<br>
<br>
Here's the link to the PLb list:<br>

<br>
Warning! It's a very prolific group!<br>
