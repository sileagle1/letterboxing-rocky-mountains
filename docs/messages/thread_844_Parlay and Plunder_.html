Boxtemberfest is taking shape! And there are two parts:<br>
<br>
The Parlay--<br>
<br>
A potluck barbeque at Noon on Saturday. Esmerelda will be the most <br>
excellent host at her house in Palisade. Please sign up at Atlas <br>
Quest and pick a thing to bring. (Beverages {no alcohol}, buns, <br>
chips, tater salad, pie). We will exchange stamps and stories and <br>
still have time for some evening letterboxing. Woot!<br>
<br>
The Plunder--<br>
<br>
We will meet at Esmerelda's house at 9:00am and carpool up onto <br>
Grand Mesa. There are tons of boxes up there in some awesome areas. <br>
If we all bring a lunch we can stop for a minute to let the ink dry <br>
and visit some more.<br>
<br>
This sounds like a real hoot and I just can't wait. Please e-mail me <br>
(edwebbe@yahoo.com) with what you are going to bring or any other <br>
concerns you might have. <br>
<br>
As the time gets closer we can post about camping possibilities and <br>
any other ideas you can come up with.<br>
<br>
Box on!<br>
