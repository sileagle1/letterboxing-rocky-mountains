I saw a lot of fishy sounding boxes pop up on the website. Does anyone <br>
have any stories?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fish Storiesah yes it was a fine summer day at the Fishing for <br>
LetterboxeR's Gathering on Saturday, July 10th in Eagle, Idaho.  The <br>
fish were jumping right on to the land and some even thought they <br>
could hide but we knew their plan.  <br>
<br>
Lot's of great fish food and snacks in our bowls but the real prize <br>
were the carvings if the truth be told.  "Three Little Fish" were <br>
hiding in a series by A-Bear.  Along came "Frog Fishing" with a <br>
croak and not far down the path "Dancing Fish" was dashing in his <br>
top hat and cane!  Down the river we headed after a quick <br>
refreshment stop and my fish friends <br>
discovered "Goldfish", "Charlie" and my tasty ode to ice <br>
cream "Phish Food" flavored that is.<br>
<br>
Our final cast of the evening was a cuckoo clue.  A great catch in <br>
water or on land as the fish were biting and it landed right into <br>
our hands!  Nets now put up for the week.   I am sure we will all be <br>
out fishing again soon before our logbooks are full and we are out <br>
of colored ink!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had fun meeting new local letterboxers.  Good times.  We succeeded <br>
in getting J-Bear to make a guest appearance which was cool because <br>
then everyone could receive his new stamp.  Of course while we <br>
letterboxed, he and our little nephew TRKR (3) passed out on/under <br>
the picnic table.  The final FISH kicker from the event, was that I <br>
returned home to start to scrapbook all my letterbox adventures.  I <br>
hope I'm not too in over my head.  =-)  <br>
<br>
The really cool part was that we were all out there hours before the <br>
event planting more boxes.  If you plant them, they will come.<br>
<br>
Let us know when any of you are headed to Idaho and we'll definitely <br>
plan another gathering, of course it doesn't have to be FISHY at <br>
all.  =-)  <br>
<br>
I loved all the cool carvings and all the creativity with the stamps <br>
and food.  Incredible FISHY for sure.  Thanks everyone.  Thanks for <br>
asking about it y-nought.  =-)  Good times.<br>
