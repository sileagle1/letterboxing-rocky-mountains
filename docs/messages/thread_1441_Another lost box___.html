a big warm slice of virtual pie to TX AF Family, who returned to me <br/>
today version #2 of my Hairstreak Butterfly box.  This was verified as <br/>
missing back over the summer and was replaced earlier this fall with <br/>
version #3.  After stamping into version #3, TX AF Family accidentally <br/>
found version #2 hiding nearby (nowhere near where it was supposed to <br/>
be)!  Apparently someone (possibly named "Free MH," the last log entry) <br/>
decided it didn't need to go back to the same spot.  Anyway, I am happy <br/>
to have it back, as there are many fun stamps and comments in the log <br/>
book.  Sometime soon, I may try to get out to the version #3 box and <br/>
combine the logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
....now, if someone would just find version #1!<br/>
