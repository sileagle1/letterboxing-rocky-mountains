                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK here's the deal:<br/>
<br/>
I work closely with our office high-production print shop.  Most of <br/>
my logbooks and box (paper) contents stuff is made from materials <br/>
that would usually be tossed/recycled.  Even with me scamming stuff <br/>
every week, there's still SO much left and I thought some of you <br/>
might be interested. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Please contact me offline with details of what you want and please,  <br/>
BE SPECIFIC with the size and quantities of what you'd like.  I'll <br/>
pick up the postage for up to 2 lbs of "stuff" each mailing - don't <br/>
worry about the postage - it also costs me nada. <winks> Be sure to <br/>
also include an address to which I am to send.  <br/>
<br/>
If emails are anything like when I had a couple hundred Altoid boxes <br/>
to give away....basically, if I have to take the time to reply to <br/>
your email asking for more info on what you want, I'm not really <br/>
interested in proceeding...<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I have some cool FREE stuff - COMPLETELY devoid <br/>
of "guilt" or the need to "payback".  Honestly, this stuff would <br/>
just go in the bin if you don't want it!  I'm only posting this here <br/>
on the RM list so things don't get outta control, so please don't <br/>
link/distribute online.  As long as I'm at this job (end of Jan 2007 <br/>
is my goal to be out the door), this is a standing offer anytime you <br/>
need/want more goodies down the road as the weather gets cooler and <br/>
the nights get longer for being creative.....<br/>
<br/>
1) I can get my hands on reams and reams and reams of thick paper <br/>
(about like index cards) with NO LINES.  Aprox 60-65 lb. weight in <br/>
all white only.  Perfect for log book pages because the ink does not <br/>
bleed through.  Not acid free, if that matters to ya.  This paper <br/>
starts off at 8 1/2 x 11.  If you just want it at this size, just <br/>
estimate how tall a stack you want in inches and I'll send it off.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, (this is the really cool part): Because I also have acess to a <br/>
heavy duty power cutter I can literally cut up to the thickness of a <br/>
ream of paper or less in ANY size you need in MINUTES.  Send EXACT <br/>
measurements (W X D X H (H = aka how tall a stack at EACH WXD  <br/>
dimension I am to cut for you).  Multi WxD (as long as you specify <br/>
H) orders NO PROBLEM!  You'd be nuts not to want this offer!<br/>
<br/>
2) At the Grand Lake Gathering we had a discussion on backings for <br/>
stamps.  Ravenwolf really like foam core.  The other day I saw a <br/>
huge piece of the MUY nice stuff in the trash, so I grabbed it.  <br/>
This stuff is SCHWEET!  The normal stuff is all white but you can <br/>
sorta put your fingernail into the outer layer ..over time anyway,  <br/>
<br/>
However, THIS stuff is stiffer than the normal stuff, but still has <br/>
some flex (unlike wood) (total width is 3/16th).  Side #1 has the <br/>
graphics for which it was produced, then tossed at the end of each <br/>
month.  Side #2 is all black...so would be good neutral color for <br/>
the "showing" side for the back of your stamps.  Both sides are <br/>
stiffer as well slicker than normal foam core, but the overall <br/>
thickness is a bit thinner than the normal stuff.  If you use some <br/>
good glue and/or sand or otherwise rough up the surface, I think <br/>
you'll like the results. I sure did.  <br/>
<br/>
I snagged a 3 FOOT piece which is more than I could use in a hundred <br/>
years....And I can get a huge piece this size every month!  I can't <br/>
precise cut this stuff for you (doesn't fit in power cutter - as <br/>
above) so I'll get out the utility knife and rough cut it at least <br/>
1" larger than the WxD dimensions you provide.<br/>
<br/>
And finally..I can't get as much of this stuff as I used to, but <br/>
still have a decent supply if you don't want it in more than a few <br/>
pieces at a time...and/or can wait a bit until my our supply stacks <br/>
up.  I'll send in 8 1/2 X 11" size only, you have to cut to size:<br/>
<br/>
3a) Chipboard cardboard. Great for logbook covers!  NOT the <br/>
cardboard box type stuff (with the "wavy bit" between the "covers"), <br/>
but rather the thin stuff...like thick cardstock really.<br/>
<br/>
3b) Regular paper weight (20lb) COLORED paper in standard Xerox <br/>
colors (nothing "groovy" but if you like grey, red, green, violet, <br/>
pink, blue and such), speak up and I'll send ya a "grab bag" when I <br/>
have some to get rid of....  Full 8 1/2 x 11 size only, you cut to <br/>
size.  If you can live with one side being printed on rather than <br/>
both sides blank, but edges dinged (and therefore won't run through <br/>
photocopiers)...please let me know - I can get my hands on more of <br/>
one-sided stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Reuse, recycle (p)rebox on!<br/>
<br/>
The Order Desk is now open!  I promise to mail w/in 7-10 work days <br/>

  My name is Mark Menard, I letterbox as lionsmane63. I live in Santa Fe, NM. My address is 63 Browncastle Ranch, Santa Fe, NM 87508.<br/>
<br/>
  Here is my order . . .<br/>
  I will take anything (white paper, chipboard, cardstock) you have cut to 2 3/4" W x 4" H x any stack height. This is the size I make all my logbooks. <br/>
  Also, could I get two 8 1/2" x 11" pieces of the foam core. And anything else you have would be great.<br/>
  I have a lot of buttons, but am not sure of the hole sizes. I will go through them and set the larger hole ones aside and I can send those to you. Let me know.<br/>
  This is so great - thank you!<br/>
