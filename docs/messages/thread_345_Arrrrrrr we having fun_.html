        Me crew and I set sail this weekend for the fair city of <br>
Moab, Utah. Yesterday was quite Mediterannean and saw us taking a dip <br>
in a pool beneath the waterfall just beyond the Left Hand Letterbox. <br>
But alas, today dawned as wet and misty as any Welsh moor and we had <br>
to avast and leave what boxes remained battened down. The plunder <br>
yesterday was much more than we expected, though, and the treasures <br>
were of the finest craft. And as we hoisted the mainsail we brought <br>
with us a traveler, out to find her fortune on the seven seas, <br>
(yeowrooo), good dog.<br>
      Fairwell and adieu,<br>
        y-nought<br>
         <br>
