but it was a great way to wind down from my day.<br/>
<br/>
It was just after a light rain and the silvery peaks were shining above <br/>
the low scudding and misty clouds. After a short round of fisticuffs <br/>
with a certain marmot that was standing right next to Aengus' original <br/>
hiding place and mocking me, I found an even better hiding place than <br/>
the first. Actually the stamp is better now and so is the container and <br/>
the logbook. <br/>
<br/>
I guess it's possible that the marmot was only trying to help me <br/>
realize more of this boxes potential. But I'll still never forgive him <br/>
for eating the visitor's stamps in that logbook.<br/>
<br/>
After it was hidden I found a few fossils among the rocks strewn about. <br/>
And then once again thanked myself for getting out and doing a little <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
