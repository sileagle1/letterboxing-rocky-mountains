I'm not exactly sure what happened, but it appears that Zebediah Gump <br>

It's so good to have a happy ending!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to the CC's for the rescue and recovery of the "Gump"!  We <br>
LOVE his story!  We are only sad because we planned on visiting him <br>
on our way to the gathering, but at least we now know to save it for <br>
another trip.  We are so excited about all the NEW boxes!  We found <br>
a bunch of older ones...a couple by the CC's....honeywine, is so <br>
fine!<br>
<br>
Looking forward to Boxtemberfest!  Pirate Peach and Cappy have a few <br>
surprises up their sleeves to add to the fun! WOOT!<br>
<br>
Hugs, Peach<br>
