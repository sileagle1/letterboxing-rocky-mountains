receiving some attention.<br/>
<br/>
I got a post through a school e-mail just yesterday that says: "Check out<br/>
the following website for something called Letter Boxing.  There are 10<br/>
in Larimer/Weld County.   http://www.letterboxing.org/"<br/>
I do think someone with lots of experience should talk to him and really<br/>
stress etiquette, etc.  I also think that there might be some fallout<br/>
with local publicity.  I've seen all of Esmerelda's Fort Collins' boxes. <br/>
They are really gorgeous and very accessible (once you've got the clues).<br/>
 Cattail's lovely Horsetooth box requires a good hike.  Other than<br/>
Esmerelda and Cattail, there are two newer box placers in that area.  I<br/>
would really hope they wouldn't discuss specific boxes!  Without some<br/>
care and thought, letterboxes are easily damaged.<br/>
We've got some boxes on the verge of going out, but we're going to wait a<br/>
bit before placing clues.<br/>

I agree that we should plant a box just for picture purposes.  I know I wouldn't want pictures of my box locations floating around for anybody to see.
