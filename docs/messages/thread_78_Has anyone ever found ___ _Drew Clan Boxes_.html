<br>
I realized while on the trail that the clues must be wrong and<br>
that the bridge count must be 7 instead of 5.  I'm 99% sure that<br>
I looked by the correct bench and it was not there.  After coming<br>
home I asked Baby Bear where he had found it last fall and he<br>
confirmed it should have been where I looked.  Therefore it<br>
probably is missing.  However, the Spouting Rock letterbox was<br>
still there as of August and the hike is well worth it even if<br>
no letterboxes were there.  Baby Bear showed me the stamp image<br>
in his logbook and it was awesome.  Too bad it is missing.<br>

I wanted to contact him but did not have his email address.<br>
I did post to the main talklist that I thought Hanging Lake<br>
was missing but did not get a response.  If you know his<br>
email, maybe you could ask if he knows anything about it<br>
and if he plans to replace it if it is indeed missing.<br>
