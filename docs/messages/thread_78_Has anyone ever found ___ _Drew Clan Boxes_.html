<br/>
I realized while on the trail that the clues must be wrong and<br/>
that the bridge count must be 7 instead of 5.  I'm 99% sure that<br/>
I looked by the correct bench and it was not there.  After coming<br/>
home I asked Baby Bear where he had found it last fall and he<br/>
confirmed it should have been where I looked.  Therefore it<br/>
probably is missing.  However, the Spouting Rock letterbox was<br/>
still there as of August and the hike is well worth it even if<br/>
no letterboxes were there.  Baby Bear showed me the stamp image<br/>
in his logbook and it was awesome.  Too bad it is missing.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">     In August I hiked up to the Adopted Country box near Pagosa <br/>
Springs. As I was stamping in I noticed that I was the first to visit <br/>
it since the Drew Clan placed it three years ago! Shows what a <br/>
lonely, albeit rewarding, time we boxers have in this neck of the <br/>
woods. Cheers, <br/>
