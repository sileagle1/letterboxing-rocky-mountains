Tentative Pie Plunder planned (don't you dig the alliteration?) for the evening of July 21. Jamie's figment says she can be there, so put a check mark on your calendars. I need to check with them and see how many LBers they mind invading their space all at the same time.<br/>

<body>You'd have to travel to the other side of the Rockies to meet up with these scalliwags. :)<br/><br/>If I get my house sold and me moved in a reasonable time frame this summer, we'll probably have a gathering in September-ish in Utah. If not, we have had some fun mini-meets lately! Just watch your AQ mail-- I tend to spam all Utah boxers when we have any sort of a gathering coming up. <br/><br/>GreenJello<p> <br/>GreenJello<br/>http://greenjelloland.blogspot.com<br/>http://letterboxingutah.blogspot.com</p><hr/><div><b>From: </b> "thewinkwinkers" &lt;stormmysky@gmail.com&gt;

<br/>
Now, we RMLBers (Rocky Mountain Letterboxers)are of the pirate variety, and it has been long established here in CO by Esmerelda, the Pirate Queen, that the pie is a pirate's preferred pastry. <br/>
<br/>
So recently, amidst some discussion of unplundered booty at our local museum, the topic of said letterbox came up. The parley went something like this:<br/>
<br/>
"PIE SHOP!!"<br/>
"And Letterbox..."<br/>
"In the pie shop?"<br/>
"IN the pie shop."<br/>
"...Mini-meet?"<br/>
"MINI-MEET!!"<br/>
<br/>
And then there was some discussion of a certain letterboxer in CO who does amazing work, but we never see her, so she is obviously a figment of the imagination of another letterboxers who self admittedly stalks the first one. (Catch all of that?) And when we may be able to see her.<br/>
<br/>
She then committed to coming down on July 21. And the Pie Plunder mini-meet was born. <br/>
<br/>
Now, I just need to get off my duff and go meet the lovely people at the pie shop, and see how many LBers they can handle descending on their lovely little establishment. When that happens, I shall post something here and on AQ.<br/>
<br/>
Clear as mud, right? :D<br/>

Dixie - please let me know if you need me to bring anything.<br/>
Once we're a bit more "organized" - can someone post the meet on AQ? <br/>
<br/>
Yay for pirates, pie, plundering, and for meeting so many new folks!<br/>
Must send a special invite to all the new local folks who have yet to walk the plank ...<br/>

I wasn't supposed to tell the about that part of it, was I?<br/>

&gt; "IN the pie shop."<br/>
&gt; "...Mini-meet?"<br/>
&gt; "MINI-MEET!!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And then there was some discussion of a certain letterboxer in CO who does amazing work, but we never see her, so she is obviously a figment of the imagination of another letterboxers who self admittedly stalks the first one. (Catch all of that?) And when we may be able to see her.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She then committed to coming down on July 21. And the Pie Plunder mini-meet was born. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, I just need to get off my duff and go meet the lovely people at the pie shop, and see how many LBers they can handle descending on their lovely little establishment. When that happens, I shall post something here and on AQ.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Clear as mud, right? :D<br/>

&gt; <br/>&gt; Now, we RMLBers (Rocky Mountain Letterboxers)are of the pirate variety, and it has been long established here in CO by Esmerelda, the Pirate Queen, that the pie is a pirate's preferred pastry. <br/>&gt; <br/>
&gt; So recently, amidst some discussion of unplundered booty at our local museum, the topic of said letterbox came up. The parley went something like this:<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; "PIE SHOP!!"<br/>&gt; "And Letterbox..."<br/>
