Park, fairly near its original location.  While there, I also checked <br/>
on Maggie and found the box relocated from its original place, the <br/>

it, ...stuff...<br/>

<br/>
While looking on the geocaching web site in hopes of finding the <br/>
person who took the stamp so I could try to get it back, I discovered <br/>
there is another geocache right near where I re-hid the Butterfly.  So <br/>
I don't know how long it will last before those chuckleheads ruin that <br/>
one too.  If you find any JeLyBean boxes with geocaching ...stuff... <br/>
in them, please do me a favor and remove it.  <br/>

I have marked Maggie as missing and have no plans to replace it.<br/>

Aaaanyhoo, I guess the good news is, I checked on another box, <br/>
Pulpit Rock, for which I'd gotten a missing report, and that was <br/>

people can still find a letterbox in this wonderful little park.  At <br/>

privileged to be introduced to this park and get a couple of wonderfully<br/>

our boxes and keep my fingers crossed!<br/>
