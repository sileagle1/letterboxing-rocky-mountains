<br>
Me and my family, along with a few friends, had a very WET weekend <br>
LetterBoxing up in the Colorado Springs area.<br>
<br>
Esmerelda - we must have just missed you! We saw your stamp at both <br>
Fox Run, and Little Feet on the 26th, and at Bear Creek on the 27th!<br>
<br>
We found the Fox Run LB in the same place as Esmerelda and also <br>
stamped in and the stamp is missing. The stamps are also missing at <br>
the Bear Creek LB.<br>
<br>
However, Little Feet, The Chantress, & The Cog Railroad all look <br>
good! <br>
<br>
Thank you to everyone who planted boxes down in the Springs for us to <br>
find - hopefully we will have better weather next time we are up <br>
there. We attempted to get the Quail Lake, Cutthroat Trout, Pulpit <br>
Rock, and Cascade Falls LB's - we even drove right to them - but the <br>
weather got icky and we had to move on.<br>

stamps and say howdy!<br>
We got wet, too, but we sure had fun! Sounds like we did all the <br>
same boxes!  We went up to Fountain and did that one, too.. fun. <br>
We noticed a note from a geocacher in the Bear Creek box saying it <br>
was her first geocache find.. we wondered if maybe that was where <br>
the stamp had gone. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am pretty sure there is a geocache somewhere near the bear creek <br>
box.  When we were there I saw a person with a GPS reciever <br>
wandering around like he was looking for something.  I looked up <br>
geocaches in the area, and there are a ton that are close in GPS <br>
coordinates to this spot, but not being a geocacher, could not tell <br>
exactly how close.  I am going to start placing notes on or in all <br>
of my letterboxes stating that they are NOT geocaches.<br>
