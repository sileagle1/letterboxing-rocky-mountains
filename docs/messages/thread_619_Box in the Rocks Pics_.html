First of all, we want to send a HUG and special thanks to Kat, <br/>
Kennamtn, Rivergeek, and Y-Nought for such a FANTATICALLY FUN time!  <br/>
You all are the absolute letterboxing dream team!  Thank you, thank <br/>
you, thank you!  We added 19 "F" boxes and a HH to our total!  We <br/>
loved all the trails, the drive-by's, the stamps, the journals, the <br/>
views, the rocks and meeting all you letterboxers!  And Kat, the <br/>
banana cream pie was to die for! We love you guys!<br/>
<br/>
The craziest story was running into A-Bear, CW Sunseeker, and Black <br/>
Velvet on Dead Horse Point planting a box!  That is a FIRST for us!  <br/>
How do you record Finding the Planter????  FP=1 for us!  What a <br/>
great story!!!  We're still laughing over that!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I have some pictures for you all.  Before I post them, I guess <br/>
I should ask you all for your permission???  If anyone wants them <br/>
emailed to their own email address, just let me know....can do!<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to all!<br/>
<br/>
Dixie Peach and Cappy too!<br/>

Mine are being developed the old fashioned way. Arrrrgh!<br/>
<br/>
Wow, sounds like there was a LOT of finding going on, even more than <br/>
I expected. Dixie Peach and Cappy hit a lot of boxes early. Did you <br/>
get any FFs?<br/>
<br/>
Ramdelt, did you do ALL the hikes? <br/>
<br/>
Cadenza, you are my hero. You were only in town a matter of hours, <br/>
and a lot of that time was spent at the gathering. To find that many <br/>
boxes on this trip makes you....well.....crazy. And I think that was <br/>
the greatest thing for me. To talk to obsessed people and hear about <br/>
carving at the campground at midnight. And all the well thought out <br/>
plans of attack, and going back again to boxes that you couldn't find <br/>
the first time around........some SERIOUS letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Is this fun, or what???<br/>

well! (: It's fun seeing the pics. I will post some. I only have a few <br/>
digital ones on my PDA. Most of mine are film too. I will develop and post <br/>
them ASAP. I think this is going to have to be a temporary place for the <br/>
pics b/c we will max out the space (it's already at 36% capacity) I want <br/>
them there though. My camera has had some problems and I want to see what <br/>
everyone else took. I think a solution will be to find somewhere good on the <br/>
web eventually to put them--somewhere we can all have access to, outside of <br/>
the group but w/ a link on the group. I will look into a few possibilities, <br/>
but if any of you know of good ones, let me know.<br/>
 If you are wondering, this is what I managed to find:<br/>
Mother Hen and Flock (Idaho box on the way down in the dark :)<br/>
Arches<br/>
ARRTOY KPRA<br/>
 Colorado River<br/>
Coyote's After You<br/>
 Desert Bighorn<br/>
Don't Bust the Crust!<br/>
Easy Rider Kokapelli<br/>
Happy B-day, 10 Year Box<br/>
Left Hand LB<br/>
Lulu's microbox<br/>
Moab Man<br/>
Moab's Box on the Rocks<br/>
#2 and #8 of Ramdelt's mystery HH's<br/>
Paddle Hard<br/>
Rock Climber<br/>
Searching . . .<br/>
Spring Dog (HH)<br/>
Ticaboo's Day Out (after 2nd attempt)<br/>
 The Westerns<br/>
 (I never do sit reports on-list. I can't believe I just did!)<br/>
 I also have a couple of hitchhikers in my car that I haven't stamped into <br/>
yet. If some of these boxes don't sound familiar to you, well, we shall see <br/>
:) And I left Little Wild Horse and planted Historic Helper. I was excited <br/>
to see a new one in Price, that will make it easier to get to helper since <br/>
they are fairly close.<br/>
 Yes, I got more than I thought I might be able to, but that's what happens <br/>
when you get to bed after 3 in the morning. Work was a bear today though! <br/>
I'm missing that nice sun in my face! I don't know what you guys meant by <br/>
bad weather in Moab. I thought it was perfect! Maybe it was before I came, <br/>
or maybe being a little further north affects my judgement of what is nice. <br/>
What am I talking about. You all got dumped with snow this week. We didn't. <br/>
Idaho used to be consistently crazy, but 7 years of drought has convinced me <br/>
that there is some cosmic force pushing weather systems away from us. Maybe <br/>
it's like a biblical plague. Didn't they usually go in increments of seven?<br/>
 Cadenza<br/>
-who's rambling on after lack of sleep. Thank you Boxer Lover for the <br/>
caffeine pills. I usually avoid those faithfully, but they were a lifesaver <br/>
last night!<br/>
