if this will help or not, but ya'll who are Bard obsessed (and at <br/>
least one other boxer with whom I've been having an email convo) <br/>
should have a look at this weekend's Sunday Denver Post (4/16/06). <br/>
<br/>
There you will find a front page article on the original Elitch <br/>
Gardens site and a theatre there that is about to start a $14 <br/>
million renovation (I live near here, they've been raising money for <br/>
years.  So NICE to see it's proceeding and they have the likes of <br/>
Cloris Leachman, Debbie Reynolds, and Patty Duke on the advisory <br/>
board...)  I might add, that since I go to the farmers markets and <br/>
the free weekly films I know that Robert Redford has his first ever <br/>
stage appearance at this place.  I got to take a toure one night on <br/>
film night.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when you flip to the inside page of the A section to keep <br/>
reading, an accompanying article begins with:<br/>
<br/>
"In the Wild West days, anything having to do with Shakespeare had <br/>
to mean class.  So when John Elitch decided to build a world-class <br/>
theater on his 32-acre farm in northwest Denver, he used the Bard's <br/>
Globe Theater as his model.  The original painted linen curtain <br/>
depicted a cottage owned by Anne Hathaway, Shakespeare's wife."....<br/>
<br/>
and so on.... I thought of all of you when I read this and knew I <br/>
had to share in case it helps...<br/>
