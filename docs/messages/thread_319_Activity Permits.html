                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just spoke with Cathy - she is the one that will approve or deny or<br>
applications. I asked her how we were to fill out the applications<br>
BEFORE we placed the boxes.  She said we will need to go out and find a<br>
spot, write up the exact directions to where it is located and then send<br>
in the application w/ the information.  The rangers go out, check the<br>
spot and then she approves or denies.  We have to be specific as to<br>
where the box will be. It can't just be a general area.  Oh, and if the<br>
clues are coded - you need to uncode them for her =]<br>
 <br>
Oh - one last thing - she mentioned that the geocachers have gotten<br>
together and one person is handling all the permitting aspects.  She<br>
said we can do that - but again, we have to be 100% specific as to where<br>
the box will be found.  If we want to go this route, we will need to<br>
contact her.  If we don't, then they only want 1 person's boxes per<br>
permit.  Of course, if you are taking responsibility for a box with an<br>
out of town owner, you can put that on your own permit.<br>
 <br>
Hope that helps everyone with filing out the form.<br>
