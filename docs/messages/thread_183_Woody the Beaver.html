Wow, your 13-year-old carved that!  That's great!  Perhaps she will <br>
need to give a class in carving shall we ever get together for an <br>
event!  I also do not design from scratch and I'm still not up to <br>
par on my carving.  Impatience has a lot to do with that though - <br>
ha!  Kudos to your 13-year-old!<br>
<br>
Thanks again for Woody the Beaver!<br>

There are a ton of kids who play in that area, so it really isn't too <br>
terribly surprising. But I would watch Woody if I were you - he may <br>
not last long.<br>
<br>
That whole area is also cared for by South Suburban Parks and Rec, <br>
and I don't know what their policy is if they find something like <br>
that. I would hope they would drop you an email if they didn't want <br>
it placed there, but who knows.<br>
<br>
I'll have to re-carve my lizard, and hide him somewhere else. The <br>
stamp isn't too big of a deal, but I would really like my logbook <br>
back. *sigh* <br>

I am glad I had the opportunity to get it before it disappeared.<br>

I am hoping Woody will make it a while... but you  never know.  I lost<br>
my first stamp (I think), Blue HEron) and like you, I can recarve, but I<br>
want the logbook! <br>

I don't know if you noticed or not, but The Alchemist's Lizard has <br>
gone AWOL. =[<br>
<br>
There are a ton of kids who play in that area, so it really isn't too <br>
terribly surprising. But I would watch Woody if I were you - he may <br>
not last long.<br>
<br>
That whole area is also cared for by South Suburban Parks and Rec, <br>
and I don't know what their policy is if they find something like <br>
that. I would hope they would drop you an email if they didn't want <br>
it placed there, but who knows.<br>
<br>
I'll have to re-carve my lizard, and hide him somewhere else. The <br>
stamp isn't too big of a deal, but I would really like my logbook <br>
back. *sigh* <br>
