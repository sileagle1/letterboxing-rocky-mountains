                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last time out there were two Astrology boxes missing.  Box # 10 Virgo <br/>
&amp; Box # 11 Sagittarius.  Today (4/9/06) I replaced box # 10 Virgo with <br/>
a brand new box (and first finder artifact).  The box has been moved <br/>
and is resting with box # 9 Aquarius due to high tide and a suspicious <br/>
looking beer bottle where the box should have been.  I hope to get Box <br/>
# 11 replaced soon.  Please make sure to re-print the clues when <br/>
heading out for this series, as it seems to be my most difficult <br/>
series to keep out in the wilds.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you to all the great letterboxers in the Northwest for all your <br/>
kind words regarding my husband, Anthony's, Spring Break Colorado <br/>
skiing accident.  He had surgery for his broken collarbone on Friday <br/>
night and so far so good.  Thank heavens for strong pain relievers.  <br/>
He may be back to work again as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday at the <br/>
latest.  I really appreciate all the support!<br/>
