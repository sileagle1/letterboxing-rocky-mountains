  From US Hwy 34 just outside of the West entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park turn onto West Portal Rd into the town of Grand Lake. Come down the hill and turn at the first right, you will pass the post office and then the elementary school on your left. Turn left at the stop sign. At the next intersection turn right and see how the other half lives as you wind along by a few of the homes on the lake shore. Start looking for the small brown signs leading you towards Hilltop and Point Park. Pass the sign that points you across the rainbow bridge to Hilltop continuing straight towards Point Park. Stay right at the Y and then turn right into the very small parking area for Point Park. Lucky you if you find a spot! If not you can pull back out, turn right again and then parallel park on that street. <br>
   <br>
  See you there!<br>

See you all soon!  Well, most of you...<br>
