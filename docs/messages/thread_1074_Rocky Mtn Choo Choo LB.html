I ended going up by that way today.  Yep folks, the stamp for this <br/>
box is gone.  I got out a flashlight and had a really good look back <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
The mini box and log ARE still there, just the stamp is missing.<br/>
<br/>
Boo!<br/>

&gt; Thank you so much!  I appreciate it! =]  If it does need a new <br/>
