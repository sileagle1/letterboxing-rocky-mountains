Oooh ... and congratulations, too.  That's a LONG hike, from what I <br/>
can tell on the clues.  6 miles or so - maybe 4+ hours?  Tell us <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">    Actually, the hike is fairly casual, mostly level until the very <br/>
end. Gorgeous country, lots of different mushrooms along the trail. <br/>
And the waterfalls are pretty cool. I was alone and cruising, so it <br/>
only took me about 2 1/2 hours. I would suggest spending more time if <br/>
you can just to soak it all in.<br/>
    I did send the Drew Clan a note. They were wondering if that box <br/>
had been swept away by nature.<br/>
    I found the Rocky Mountains micro last weekend near RMNP. Neat.<br/>
Is it appropriate to stamp into a micro box pad? I didn't know so I <br/>
squeezed mine in. I hope it is alright.<br/>
