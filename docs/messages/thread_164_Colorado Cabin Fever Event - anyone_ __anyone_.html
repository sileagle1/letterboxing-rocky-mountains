Tons of interest. And cabin fever through the roof. But, alas, I have<br/>
no free weekend in March.<br/>
   Thinking SPRING,<br/>

&gt; C'mon, there must be more interest????  Thanks to all of you that<br/>
&gt; have replied so far!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hey Autumn, no wimps allowed - hee, hee!  Of course, YOU must be<br/>
&gt; there!  Perhaps if the weather IS bad, we can find a warm, cozy<br/>
spot <br/>
&gt; inside - maybe even a happy hour, Saturday lunch or dinner.  Just<br/>
&gt; some time to gather, catch up, exchange ideas, stamp in, etc.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don't be shy!  Where is everyone?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello RMLetterboxing!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Here I am, putting myself on the line, I have severe cabin fever<br/>
&gt; &gt; (perhaps fault of my own), okay I am going snowshoeing this<br/>
&gt; weekend -<br/>
&gt; &gt;  cut to the chase:  Would anyone be interested in a late March<br/>
&gt; &gt; gathering?  March 27th perhaps?  I am willing to coordinate/host<br/>
&gt; &gt; this event.  I simply want to know if there is interest first? If<br/>
&gt; &gt; so, I will look for a suitable location (depending on weather) -<br/>
I <br/>
&gt; &gt; would prefer to have it outdoors.  As we all know, Colorado<br/>
&gt; weather <br/>
&gt; &gt; is unpredictable.  It would be nice to see everyone again and<br/>
&gt; &gt; hopefully meet the newer boxers.  I suppose I miss the dialogue<br/>
in <br/>
&gt; &gt; our area for this hobby.  Don't let cabin fever stop YOU!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Looking forward to your replies!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Ciao,<br/>
