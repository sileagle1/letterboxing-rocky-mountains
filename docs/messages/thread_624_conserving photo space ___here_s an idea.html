Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Boy, I am totally bummed stuck here reading all the fun you guys had<br/>
this past weekend.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I belong to well over 100 yahoo groups (I have no life) and a lot of<br/>
the groups use the "FILE" section when the "PHOTO" section gets<br/>
filled.  The "file" section lets you store up to 20MB of space.  You<br/>
create a folder: whether: "Moab pics" or "Jane Doe's pics" or "Group<br/>
pic's" and then post all the pictures in that folder.  This way<br/>
everyone can have their own folder with 'permission' to<br/>
add/delete/change anything.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps you.  Going to back to lurkdom.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Great pics by the way you guys.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Okay, I have an idea to conserve space and add as many photos as we<br/>
want so <br/>
&gt; that we can all share!!!<br/>
&gt;  I have set up a new account with Yahoo under the username<br/>
lbadventures. I <br/>
&gt; created a folder in there that can have public access. I can post as<br/>
many <br/>
&gt; photos as I want with no limitation. I can only put up to 300 in a<br/>
folder, <br/>
&gt; but I can keep making folders. <br/>
&gt;  This means I could take photos from the site and add them all to<br/>
the photos <br/>
&gt; page and post the link on the list. I think it will be a great idea and <br/>
&gt; provide no limitations on how many photos we share. <br/>
&gt;  I can think of a couple of down sides though. For one, I would have<br/>
to be <br/>
&gt; the one to post things on there, so you could put photos on the list<br/>
(or <br/>
&gt; email them to me) and I can put them in the photos page, but others<br/>
can't <br/>
&gt; add or take them away. If someone wants one in or out. I can do it.<br/>
I am <br/>
&gt; happy to do this though, and if anyone has concerns about a certain<br/>
photo, I <br/>
&gt; could remove it immediately. Another possible concern is that in<br/>
order for <br/>
&gt; us to let anyone on the list see them, I would have to leave it open<br/>
for <br/>
&gt; public access. Much of Yahoo is like this anyway already and I don't<br/>
have a <br/>
&gt; problem with this since I don't think we would put anything in there<br/>
that <br/>
&gt; could be used maliciously, but I understand that some might have a<br/>
problem <br/>
&gt; with it. The only other options are totally private (which defeats the <br/>
&gt; point) or me inviting certain email addresses (which could take<br/>
forever and <br/>
&gt; change constantly.) <br/>
&gt;  Anyway, I think this might be a nice option. I've seen some do it<br/>
already. <br/>
&gt; Ryan's old website had links to his yahoo photos page so other<br/>
letterboxers <br/>
&gt; could look at his photos if they wanted to. I thought it worked well<br/>
in that <br/>
&gt; situation. <br/>
&gt;  If you want to see how it works, I already added a couple pictures<br/>
into the <br/>
&gt; "links" section of the list. I can take it off easily, but I thought<br/>
I'd <br/>
&gt; give you a couple of pictures to let you see how it works. You can<br/>
still <br/>
&gt; download pictures, print them, order photos or gifts with those photos <br/>
&gt; without my permission. I think it will even let you have 10 free <br/>
&gt; professional prints. Of course there is no charge to save or print it <br/>
&gt; yourself. Let me know what you think. If I feel you all like it, I will <br/>
&gt; start transferring photos over!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've seen that too. Many had done that at the big letterboxing list. The <br/>
problem was, it still ran out of space oftentimes. As a moderator there, we <br/>
have had to make various pleas to empty out old files and photos and it is <br/>
sad to have to erase that part of history to make room for more. Also, if we <br/>
want to add a bunch--like a community pool of different pics from the <br/>
gathering, I think a website is a better way to go. <br/>
 just my two cents<br/>
