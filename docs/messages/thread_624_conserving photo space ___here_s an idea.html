Hi all,<br>
<br>
Boy, I am totally bummed stuck here reading all the fun you guys had<br>
this past weekend.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I belong to well over 100 yahoo groups (I have no life) and a lot of<br>
the groups use the "FILE" section when the "PHOTO" section gets<br>
filled.  The "file" section lets you store up to 20MB of space.  You<br>
create a folder: whether: "Moab pics" or "Jane Doe's pics" or "Group<br>
pic's" and then post all the pictures in that folder.  This way<br>
everyone can have their own folder with 'permission' to<br>
add/delete/change anything.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps you.  Going to back to lurkdom.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Great pics by the way you guys.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've seen that too. Many had done that at the big letterboxing list. The <br>
problem was, it still ran out of space oftentimes. As a moderator there, we <br>
have had to make various pleas to empty out old files and photos and it is <br>
sad to have to erase that part of history to make room for more. Also, if we <br>
want to add a bunch--like a community pool of different pics from the <br>
gathering, I think a website is a better way to go. <br>
 just my two cents<br>
