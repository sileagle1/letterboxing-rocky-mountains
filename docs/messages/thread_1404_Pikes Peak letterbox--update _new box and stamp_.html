                    <div class="plaintext-content">A couple of weeks ago, our family ventured to the Crystal Reservoir <br/>
at Pikes Peak and located this box (bag). We were quite disappointed <br/>
to find no stamp, and from the looks of the logbook entries, many <br/>
finders felt the same way upon finding this "box". When I contacted <br/>
Serena, the owner, she informed me that she is now living in CT and <br/>
is unable to maintain the box. So...she gave her blessing for me to <br/>
assume ownership of this LB. As of this morning, a "real" box was <br/>
placed in the same location including a new logbook and new <br/>
handcarved stamp (Old logbook is still there as well). I've also <br/>
included a couple of "First Finders" gifts :-) Please give this box a <br/>
second find next time you are in the area! Preboxed's "Pike's Hike" <br/>
and "Big Foot X-ing" are nearby as well :-)<br/>
<br/>
This box is also now listed on Atlasquest under the author's <br/>
trailname "Sunfloweerr" for now. I'll soon be assuming ownership and <br/>
making a few minor adjustments in the clues (For instance, there is <br/>
no longer a small log in the trail), but the clues should still be <br/>
able to lead one to the box.<br/>

bag some time ago and tried to contact Serena but never got a <br/>
response.  I'm glad it's finally restored.  By the way, if you're <br/>
heading up the Peak to find some of these boxes, the Altitude <br/>
Sickness box is no longer at the summit, but there is still an <br/>
unpublished JeLyBean box on the mountain (as far as I know).<br/>
