                    <div class="plaintext-content">Missed all the postings yesterday, I was out shoveling, shoveling, <br/>
shoveling!  Then came in for some holiday cheer by the fire!  But <br/>
today....YOWWIE!!!  Just got back from the Honey Baked Ham store and <br/>
felt like I was in some disaster movie along with uncountable others <br/>
and we were all buying ham and turkey for the holidays!<br/>
<br/>
Traffic lights are out...Frosty won't know which way to go!  Some of <br/>
the major streets are in great condition and then some are in <br/>
terrible condition!  A lady in a GEO did a 180 right in front of us, <br/>
luckily for all she didn't hit anyone, there was plenty of traffic, <br/>
she just got very, very, lucky!!!  YOW!!!  We're back home till <br/>
tomorrow...it's wacky out there folks!<br/>
<br/>
Boxlover, we were here for the Blizzard of '82 also!  It was wild <br/>
and the roads were icey/bumpy until Spring!  <br/>
<br/>
Jrsyboy, glad you're by light rail...it's the best thing Denver's <br/>
ever done!<br/>
<br/>
PRE, if you get that shovel (with attachments) for Christmas, tell <br/>
him to come out to our neighborhood to earn some extra cash!!!<br/>
<br/>
ES, glad you didn't get stuck here in port, I'd hate to be out there <br/>
today! <br/>
<br/>
Aljan, hope your moose show up for a holiday cheer!  They would take <br/>
a great picture in the snow in those trees!<br/>
<br/>
Merry Christmas, everyone!!!  Hope your holidays are safe and <br/>
bright!!!<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to all, Peach....off to make sure she has enough grog for the <br/>
festivities!<br/>

Hiya Coloradoans, from rainy and warm Michigan!  All your snow has <br/>
made it our way in the form of dreary rainy wetness.<br/>
<br/>
I was supposed to fly in yesterday.  But, obviously THAT didn't <br/>
happen.  I'm scheduled to arrive tomorrow night.  Hopefully the <br/>
airport and things will be cleared up by then.  I'm bummed because I <br/>
lost two days of my already too short trip to Colorado.  Even less <br/>
boxing time for me now!  May not be able to do ANY boxing with as <br/>
much snow as you guys got!  Unbelievable!<br/>
<br/>
Luckily my flight was originally on Thursday, not Wednesday.  So, I <br/>
didn't have too much hassle, other than being on hold for an hour <br/>
trying to get a new flight.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all are safe, snug and warm out there.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A couple of years ago I did a trip where I found a few boxes in some <br/>
fairly deep snow. On the plus side....there was nobody hanging around <br/>
wondering what I was doing, and I was able to use tree boughs to sweep <br/>
the powder back in place so I wouldn't leave behind a trail to the <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
On the negative side, I blew right past a "fork in the trail" because <br/>
it wasn't visible and it took me a while to deduce where one box was. <br/>
And I had to keep my ink in an inside pocket so the 5 degree cold <br/>
wouldn't harm it (I guess it had to freeze on the page anyway....).<br/>
<br/>
I imagine some urban boxes might be available depending on what the <br/>
maintenance people do. Some areas get shoveled out...while some areas <br/>
are used to stack snow.<br/>
<br/>
So good luck Beth, I hope you are able to find something,<br/>

<br/>
Denver Skatepark should be ok.  Door Open Denver "might" be <br/>
accessible, but the park hasn't been plowed yet.<br/>

I was out and about today.  Now, you know in summer weather I like <br/>
Slurpees as much as the next person.....but right now keep your <br/>
windows rolled up!  Something that merely LOOKS like Slurpees kept <br/>

Oh yes AND my much underloved, replaced GMEII box...sigh..I'm a fan of <br/>
that box, even if no one else seems to be..including the urban <br/>
gardener types...<br/>

Thanks to Amy for the email reminding me of that box that even I <br/>
forget about sometimes...and which should be accessible...snow-wise at <br/>
the moment.<br/>
