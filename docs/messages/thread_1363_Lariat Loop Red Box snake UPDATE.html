rescuing the Lariat Loop Red box in conjunction with last night's <br>
mini-meet-and-greet in Golden.  I can't thank you two enough!<br>
<br>
There was clandestine hiking. There were tongs.  There was almost <br>
an "oh $%*#" moment when we were leaving the area - good thing that <br>
gate wasn't really locked...  <br>
<br>
A great adventure in a beautiful area.  Most importantly, a really <br>
great letterboxing story I know I'll be thinking about for a really <br>
long time! :-)<br>
<br>
The online clue sheet for the LL red box was updated as of this <br>
morning, 7/19/07.  I'll be dropping by some key places on the loop <br>
to update the rattlesnake warnings after work today.<br>
<br>
Finders should still exercise extreme caution when hunting down this <br>
box!!!<br>
