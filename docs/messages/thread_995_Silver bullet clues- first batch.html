Howdy folks-<br>
<br>
The Durango Snowdown festival has begun and there are a LOT of cool <br>
prizes for whomever finds the hidden Silver Bullet. Those of you who <br>
remember last year's event will recall that the clues, especially <br>
the early ones, are very vague which keeps people glued to the radio <br>
all week. So here are the first four:<br>
<br>
1. North of Tuba City to Fair Dealing.<br>
<br>
2. South of 240. (This is a county road number and it makes sense.)<br>
<br>
3. Montrose east to Bernalillo.<br>
<br>
4. West of 234. (Also a county road number, this clue basically <br>
means that it is in Durango.....duh!)<br>
<br>
So there you go, there will be five clues a day until Saturday <br>
afternoon, when the last clue basically tells where it is if it <br>
hasn't been found yet. <br>
<br>
Very appreciatively,<br>
