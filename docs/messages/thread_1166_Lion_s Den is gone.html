had a box go missing for a while, until now. I'll be working on <br>
replacing the Lion's Den this Fall. The clues to this letterbox have <br>
been pulled from another local letterbox for the time being. There are <br>
no published clues.<br>
<br>
To lose this one is a little bit tough for me. It was first found in <br>
June of 2004 by the young SplendidBuccaneers, Nightcrawler and <br>
Pixiejunction. One of the very first local boxes ever found, it <br>
reminds me of how excited I was when I realized that people would <br>
actually visit these things.<br>
<br>
I'll poke around for another hiding spot, but the new lion will <br>
probably live in the old den.<br>

Happy Trails,<br>

one of the first I found also. I sooooo remember the excitement of <br>
finding those extra clues and how long we waited to casually get the <br>
box those clues were in. Classes were getting out at that time and <br>
there were people everywhere. I remember we had to use Aspen as the <br>
distraction to get the box with clues!<br>
