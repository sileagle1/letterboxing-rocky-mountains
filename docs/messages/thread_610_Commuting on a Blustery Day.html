Wow.. I'm looking at the window thinking of all of you and WILLING <br>
this nasty wind and rain to go away!!  It best be blowin' itself out <br>
tonight so that tomorrow is a perfect letterbox day for y'all.. or <br>
someone is walkin' the plank!<br>
<br>
This morning was oooh so lovely and I had the very great pleasure of <br>
a drive in the pirate-mobile out towards Utah to visit Kat's new <br>
Commuting box.  What a perfect place for it!  I tell you, there is <br>
just nothing like the feeling of slamming the car door shut, <br>
slinging your letterboxing bag over your shoulder and heading down <br>
the trail on another adventure.  It just makes me want to sing sea <br>
ditties.  Which, surprise, I do. arrrr.<br>
<br>
Kat,  I've lived here for eleventy billion years and had never heard <br>
that story... loved it!!   And loved the picture!  And the stamp!  <br>
And the journal!  And the first finder certificate!  Thanks for the <br>
wonderful morning... it was like something special to keep me from <br>
feeling so sad about not being there with y'all tomorrow. <br>
<br>
Pirates love letterboxing.<br>
<br>
Es, going out to shake her cutlass at the sky and demand that it <br>
clear up by 2 tomorrow <br>

Yayy! oh, I mean Arrr, (spits in the dust), I'm glad you had fun and <br>
found the new box this morning! Isn't that a fun story, and fun to <br>
imagine as we drive along out there in the boonies!(And didn't you <br>
love the "J" in Junction? For the life of me, I have yet to carve <br>
a "J" in the right direction. Duh!!! It WAS a gorgeous morning, and <br>
actually it hasn't rained here yet, so maybe it will just bluster a <br>
bit and go away! It is so strange to be here going about a normal <br>
Saturday (soccer, lunch, dance exhibition, checking in at work, <br>
etc..) knowing there are people crawling all around Moab searching <br>
for the hidden treasures! <br>
<br>
We surely will miss Es and TDG this time around, but I think we may <br>
make this a happy habit of getting this group together!!<br>
<br>
You made my day, Es, by getting out and having fun, thanks!!!<br>
Kat<br>
