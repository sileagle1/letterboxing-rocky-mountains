                    <div class="plaintext-content">Idaho is actually divided fairly accurately.  I've been happy with our regions.  Utah was fine as one, but it is becoming more cumbersome as there are many more boxes now than there used to be.  I don't know that I would change much with UT though other than to divide it into N and S, and maybe Central (which doesn't really have any boxes right now).<br>

    I could vote for that. But I would like to hear from some other <br>
people on this list. Arizona and Utah have all boxes listed together; <br>
is that becoming too much as more boxes are planted? Idaho, Montana, <br>
Wyoming and New Mexico are divided into regions. How is that working <br>
for you folks? <br>
