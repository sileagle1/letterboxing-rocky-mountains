Island Park Idaho is a bit farther for me. But it would also fulfill <br/>
a lifelong dream. I would not be able to go to the Tetons without <br/>
climbing a peak, so for me it would be a weekend of boxing and a week <br/>
of climbing and traveling.<br/>
<br/>
So, just throwing my two cents into the ring, I'd love to gather <br/>
around Yellowstone. The best times for me (and for climbing) would be <br/>
May-June or September. But I would try to make it anytime there was a <br/>
group of letterboxers getting together.<br/>
<br/>
And a pirate told me once that there is an awesome Museum in Cody. If <br/>
you can believe pirates. <br/>

Okay.. that was an official spit take when I read that.  I should know <br/>
better than to be mid-drink when reading any notes on here!  <br/>
<br/>
There is not only one awesome Museum in Cody.. there are five.. <br/>
count 'em.. five.  And one day I will visit them.  Arrr.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">there are amazing museums in Cody. It is an interesting town. Outside of the <br/>
hotel Buffalo Bill Cody built for his daughter, Irma, they have shootouts <br/>
each evenening for the tourists. It's pretty funny. There are also a bunch <br/>
of letterboxes, some by Don and Gwen, but most are by a small group of <br/>
school kids in Wapiti. There are a lot of manufactured stamps, but this is <br/>
the only time I didn't give a flip about that. It was so cute to know that a <br/>
group of school kids, in what is almost a one room school house from the <br/>
outside, decided that letterboxing would be a fun way to teach themselves <br/>
and others about the history of their area. It made my day to find most of <br/>
their boxes. <br/>
 I wasn't really thinking this year would work. It sounds as if there are <br/>
already enough plans in the works and a third gathering in a few months may <br/>
be a bit much. I was thinking more along the lines of next summer. that <br/>
would give us time to catch our breath a bit and some time to psych <br/>
ourselves up for an excuse to make another long drive to a fun new place. <br/>
It's funny how many have never been to Yellowstone. I'm embarrased to admit <br/>
that I didn't go until I moved here four years ago (and I went to jr. <br/>
college in this area for two years). I just thought it was so fun to get out <br/>
and explore Moab and all it's fun and doing this area might be too. If we <br/>
do, I will definitely get working on planting this summer.<br/>
