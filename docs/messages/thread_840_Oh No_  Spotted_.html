                    <div class="plaintext-content">So I stopped by to check on my Commissioners Shooting LB this afternoon as I was running a little early to leave for work.  Those of you that have stamped in know what a wickedly busy spot this is and I have been in a constant state of worry about that box disappearing.  There was one lady fishing and a young boy throwing rocks over on the other side of the bridge from where the box is...  anyhow, short story long, the box was actually peeking out of its hole (YIKES) and as I was digging out some rocks and making sure it got stuck waaayyyyy back in there I had the horrible feeling that I was being watched.  The boy was standing right over me!  Damn.  I said hi and he bolted but I am sure that he will go back to investigate.  I'll have to go and check on it again tomorrow!  Cursed by my own choice of such a busy spot!<br/>

Think good thoughts for my box!  Aljan<br/>
