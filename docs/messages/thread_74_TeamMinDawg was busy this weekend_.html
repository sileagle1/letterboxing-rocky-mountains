                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just noticed that they planted two new boxes in Deer Creek Park <br>
(Jefferson County, Littleton Colorado).  And as is pointed out in the <br>
clues ... this open space area is Dog Friendly and Free! :)   <br>
<br>
Whoop!  (my dog is too much of a wimp to box with me, but I digress)<br>
<br>
I don't know if I'll ever be in good enough shape for the Homesteader <br>
box, but I think the Deer Stick box is doable for me on a good day!<br>
<br>
Thanks for planting more boxes!<br>
