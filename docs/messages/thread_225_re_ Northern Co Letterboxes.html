As far as I know there are no boxes in this area.  We are also in Fort<br>
Collins.  I hope to plant one by the end of the month.  (Gotta get my<br>
artist husband to make a cool stamp.. and this could take so pushing.) Let<br>
me know if you find one.<br>

Carrie - I am planning to plant a box before I leave - do you think <br>
you could adopt it?  I probably won't be back for maintenance or <br>
anything, so I'd feel bad just leaving it without a guardian.  I'm <br>
