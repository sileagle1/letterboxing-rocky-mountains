  Has anyone heard anything from Ewok?  She and I were supposed to meet up for<br/>
  an exchange last weekend.  We wrote many times about it, and she said she<br/>
  was going to call as she figured out some plans.  I guess I was a little<br/>
  nervous for her since I haven't heard anything of her since earlier this<br/>
  week.  I'm sure things are fine, but I was a little worried anyway since she<br/>
  had sounded pretty excited about coming this direction for some letterboxes.<br/>

you get snowed on too?  It has been pretty cold the last couple of weeks.<br/>
You will have to let me know what boxes you found.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just glad to hear you made it back safe and sound.  Too bad we missed<br/>
each other, I received Martha by Mail this week and I held on to it for a<br/>
few extra days to stamp in with you :(  Would you believe I got a hitchiker<br/>
with it too (my first ever!).  Sorry we weren't able to cross paths.  I left<br/>
my number in one of my boxes in Idaho Falls in case you went looking in<br/>
there.  Oh well, I will catch you sometime when I head to CO.<br/>
