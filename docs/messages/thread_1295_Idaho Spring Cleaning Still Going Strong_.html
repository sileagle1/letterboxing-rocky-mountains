                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Dixie Peach!  Sorry you can't make it to Idaho this spring for <br/>
some boxing.  Things have really heated up here and we are like <br/>
boxing maniacs these days.  I think just about every other day I have <br/>
either been out checking my old boxes, searching for new boxes or <br/>
replanting.  Last night Lizman, Raisin and I were out in the dark re-<br/>
planting boxes.  I was too tired to even post when I got home.  Not <br/>
to mention that it was really getting chilly out.  Lizman talks about <br/>
wanting to go back to Moab to box all the time.  One of these days we <br/>
will need to come to Colorado to box with you.  My sister had a baby <br/>
in October she is still living in Colorado Springs.  Eventually I am <br/>
sure we will be thinking road trip your direction.  Until then we are <br/>
planting lots of boxes up here to tempt you and Captain Ron to come <br/>
for a visit.  Our home is always open if you need a place to crash <br/>
when you come!  Letterboxing hugs from up North!  Blackvelvetrav &amp; <br/>
