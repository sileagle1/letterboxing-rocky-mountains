to say a few (or many) words about Renaipalooza.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Sasha and I went early to the Rock so we could leave a HH <br/>
in the box...we passed a smiling gentleman and his daughter on our <br/>
way down but didn't see any letterboxing stuff so didn't stop or ask <br/>
questions.  Of course, when they came back down with the HH in their <br/>
hands we wooted and were soon introducing ourselves to Silver Eagle <br/>
and his lovely daughter.. only moments before the Noughts pulled up <br/>
and joined the party. A most excellent adventure that had us smiling <br/>
the rest of the night.  <br/>
<br/>
Early this morning we met the Noughts outside the faire and had just <br/>
a superb morning following them around (are they still behind us?!) <br/>
and saying arrrr to strangers.  At the appointed time Y and I went <br/>
to the gate to watch for boxing faces and it wasn't long before we <br/>
were all at our table stamping and chatting and sharing and eating <br/>
eclairs and taking pictures and.. oh my heck, I had such a great <br/>
time!  Even though I've known y'all are just coolest of people, in <br/>
person you're surely the nicest bunch of folks I've had the honor to <br/>
be around in a very long time.  And, come on, sitting around a table <br/>
in the shade eating eclairs and talking about letterboxing while <br/>
kilted men play bagpipes in the background?!  I'm still smiling! Of <br/>
course, we had our very own kilted Y.  Is this a great country or <br/>
what?<br/>
<br/>
So.. sorry for all the notes but had to say WOOT and see you all <br/>
next time!  Huzzah!<br/>

As previously feared, I ended up winning the Greeley Tennis Championships and thus was on the court playing while the rest of you were eating tasty treats.  Hopefully I'll be able to make it to the next gathering.<br/>
