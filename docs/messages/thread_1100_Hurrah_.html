<br/>
I'll bet John Mayer was very good, and not in a heart throb kinda <br/>
way. I just like his music.<br/>
<br/>
The Hippies were awesome! And I also appreciated the way the Race <br/>
was set up, following a very physical challenge in Alaska with a <br/>
mental/observational challenge at the end with the flags.I probably <br/>
would have been there guessing at flags all night.<br/>
<br/>
I back my stamps with plexiglass ever since I saw a Ravenwolf stamp <br/>
backed that way. It has just the right amount of flex for a good <br/>
image. I do use rubber cement and I have had one melt on a Moab <br/>
trip, but it solidified again after we got into a cooler climate. I <br/>
think it is crucial to just use a little bit and let it dry really <br/>
well before sticking the two halves together.<br/>
<br/>
I want to go letterboxing something feirce!<br/>
