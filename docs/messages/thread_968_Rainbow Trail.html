We found Rainbow Trail some time ago, as well.  Yes, the plastic shoebox<br/>
is hard to hide and it is right next to the trail.  We sent Edna a<br/>
message about its situation and never heard back.  What do you do about<br/>
boxes like that?  I consider it abandoned and personally hate to see<br/>
people go out of their way to look for it.  Is their any way to get a<br/>
note put onto the letterboxing.org website, which states its condition???<br/>
 If that isn't possible, can it be adopted and completely revamped into a<br/>
functioning letterbox?  What happened to Ramdelt's idea a while back<br/>
about having a database with problematic boxes?<br/>
<br/>
It is a beautiful area and it seems as though Calli-K's new box is in<br/>
that same general area???  Is it off the same trailhead?<br/>
<br/>
Is there a procedure to take off a confirmed problematic box or can it be<br/>
adopted by someone else and have a new stamp carved?  There isn't an<br/>
image of the old stamp and the new stamp is purchased.... I believe it is<br/>
a star ... something unrelated to the box name or place.  I'm thinking<br/>
that we didn't stamp into the logbook.  I do know we didn't put the new,<br/>
unrelated stamp into our journal.  There are two edna's listed on<br/>
letterboxing.org ... one with a big E and one with a little e.  The<br/>
little "e" placer has five boxes in Illinois.  I've written to her asking<br/>
if she is the same placer.  My guess is they are not one in the same, as<br/>
I thought the log at Rainbow Trail said it was her first box and two of<br/>
the placement dates in Illinois predate the boxes in Colorado.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Was this an issue that was also brought up on the main list?  Just<br/>
curious.  I can understand some concern about having a box listed as<br/>
being a problem, as someone could be looking in the wrong place.  That<br/>
often happens.  However, there are some boxes that are a CONFIRMED<br/>
problem and it is not good to have person after person go look for it. <br/>
Rainbow Trail is now listed as recently found in the database, but there<br/>
is critical information missing.  It really is a long way over there to<br/>
that box.  We happened to be in the general area for other reasons, so it<br/>
wasn't a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
We encountered lots of missing boxes this summer in the northwest and it<br/>
was very frustrating.  In most cases, it was obvious that we had found<br/>
the right spot, but no box.  Essentially, we made it a point not to look<br/>
for any boxes that were remotely out of our way and that is sad for us<br/>
and for box owners.<br/>
<br/>
I love all you box owners who follow up on reports of missing or damaged<br/>
boxes.  I've found that to be the norm in our area, but I understand the<br/>
difficulty of that for boxes placed far from home!  In fact, we went out<br/>
and found A Mountain Monogram today.  It was our second attempt.  I<br/>
appreciated the fact that No No Girl quickly responded to our report of<br/>
the A Mountain Monogram missing back in October.  I personally think that<br/>
it was accidently found by the folks who repainted the A and they might<br/>
have passed it around for others to look at and then simply put it back<br/>
in the wrong spot.  No No Girl and her Brother must have worked hard to<br/>
find it in all that white rubble.  Good job!<br/>
<br/>
That's enough rambling ...<br/>

&gt; Catamount Carvers, I appreciate the message.  I have been recently <br/>
&gt; released from the hospital from the attacks that I took over this <br/>
&gt; suggestion a few months ago.  Maybe when I recover fully and I get <br/>
&gt; back out to do more boxing, I will get more serious about this <br/>
&gt; again.  It's tough to make everyone happy.<br/>

&gt; It is a beautiful area and it seems as though Calli-K's new box is in<br/>
&gt; that same general area???  Is it off the same trailhead?<br/>
<br/>
No, the box I left for you folks in Colorado is off highway 50, seemed<br/>
like maybe the northern-most point of Rainbow trail, although I<br/>
couldn't be sure.  We parked at a trail head that WAS the Rainbow<br/>
Trail, not a trail leading up to it, so it was either the beginning or<br/>
the end, or appeared to be.  Having placed "A Gift From Oregon" and<br/>
having found Edna's "Rainbow Trail" I can tell you they are not in the<br/>
same vicinity at all.  There are several postcards with Edna's address<br/>
on them, and I took one and mailed it today, telling her I had<br/>
e-mailed her as well.  And yes, the stamp in there now is a commercial<br/>
 stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
My concern over a box like that is that it says bad things about<br/>
letterboxing to hikers.  It looks trashy sitting there with its broken<br/>
lid and all.  A hiker seeing that would certainly not be very<br/>
intrigued by "letterboxing" - anyway, maybe someone will hear from<br/>
her.  If I were a local I would just go on up there after not hearing<br/>
via e-mail and postal mail to her address and revamp the box.  I'd<br/>
carve my own stamp and just put it in there, put in a new smaller log<br/>
book, and hide it the way a letterbox should be hidden, strictly for<br/>
the sake of letterboxing's good name.  I'm not local, and I wouldn't<br/>
want to step on toes as a guest in your state, just my opinion as to<br/>
something that could be done without any guilt.  One of the first<br/>
people I met to learn about letterboxing told me an untended box is<br/>
considered "trash."  That's a bit harsh, because there are so many<br/>
people who place boxes all over the place and can't possibly tend to<br/>
them, but they at least stay in touch with the letterboxing site and<br/>
allow others to adopt them or tend to them if they like.  Placing a<br/>
box and then never coming back to the web site or the physical site to<br/>
check on it seems kind of like abandonment to me, in which case anyone<br/>
interested should not feel bad about tending to it.  <br/>
<br/>
I will certainly come back here and let you all know if mailing the<br/>
postcard to her house results in anything at all.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, I sure loved your beautiful state - JeLyBean told me a critter<br/>
has been chewing on the box I left you - hope it got frustrated and<br/>
gave up and doesn't come back to do further damage.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year to you all.<br/>
