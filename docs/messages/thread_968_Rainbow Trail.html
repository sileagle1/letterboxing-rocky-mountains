We found Rainbow Trail some time ago, as well.  Yes, the plastic shoebox<br>
is hard to hide and it is right next to the trail.  We sent Edna a<br>

boxes like that?  I consider it abandoned and personally hate to see<br>
people go out of their way to look for it.  Is their any way to get a<br>
note put onto the letterboxing.org website, which states its condition???<br>

functioning letterbox?  What happened to Ramdelt's idea a while back<br>
about having a database with problematic boxes?<br>
<br>
It is a beautiful area and it seems as though Calli-K's new box is in<br>
that same general area???  Is it off the same trailhead?<br>
<br>
Is there a procedure to take off a confirmed problematic box or can it be<br>
adopted by someone else and have a new stamp carved?  There isn't an<br>
image of the old stamp and the new stamp is purchased.... I believe it is<br>
a star ... something unrelated to the box name or place.  I'm thinking<br>
that we didn't stamp into the logbook.  I do know we didn't put the new,<br>
unrelated stamp into our journal.  There are two edna's listed on<br>
letterboxing.org ... one with a big E and one with a little e.  The<br>
little "e" placer has five boxes in Illinois.  I've written to her asking<br>
if she is the same placer.  My guess is they are not one in the same, as<br>
I thought the log at Rainbow Trail said it was her first box and two of<br>
the placement dates in Illinois predate the boxes in Colorado.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Was this an issue that was also brought up on the main list?  Just<br>
curious.  I can understand some concern about having a box listed as<br>
being a problem, as someone could be looking in the wrong place.  That<br>
often happens.  However, there are some boxes that are a CONFIRMED<br>
problem and it is not good to have person after person go look for it. <br>
Rainbow Trail is now listed as recently found in the database, but there<br>
is critical information missing.  It really is a long way over there to<br>
that box.  We happened to be in the general area for other reasons, so it<br>
wasn't a big deal.<br>
<br>
We encountered lots of missing boxes this summer in the northwest and it<br>
was very frustrating.  In most cases, it was obvious that we had found<br>
the right spot, but no box.  Essentially, we made it a point not to look<br>
for any boxes that were remotely out of our way and that is sad for us<br>
and for box owners.<br>
<br>
I love all you box owners who follow up on reports of missing or damaged<br>
boxes.  I've found that to be the norm in our area, but I understand the<br>
difficulty of that for boxes placed far from home!  In fact, we went out<br>
and found A Mountain Monogram today.  It was our second attempt.  I<br>
appreciated the fact that No No Girl quickly responded to our report of<br>
the A Mountain Monogram missing back in October.  I personally think that<br>
it was accidently found by the folks who repainted the A and they might<br>
have passed it around for others to look at and then simply put it back<br>
in the wrong spot.  No No Girl and her Brother must have worked hard to<br>
find it in all that white rubble.  Good job!<br>
<br>
That's enough rambling ...<br>

No, the box I left for you folks in Colorado is off highway 50, seemed<br>
like maybe the northern-most point of Rainbow trail, although I<br>
couldn't be sure.  We parked at a trail head that WAS the Rainbow<br>
Trail, not a trail leading up to it, so it was either the beginning or<br>
the end, or appeared to be.  Having placed "A Gift From Oregon" and<br>
having found Edna's "Rainbow Trail" I can tell you they are not in the<br>
same vicinity at all.  There are several postcards with Edna's address<br>
on them, and I took one and mailed it today, telling her I had<br>
e-mailed her as well.  And yes, the stamp in there now is a commercial<br>
 stamp.  <br>
<br>
My concern over a box like that is that it says bad things about<br>
letterboxing to hikers.  It looks trashy sitting there with its broken<br>
lid and all.  A hiker seeing that would certainly not be very<br>
intrigued by "letterboxing" - anyway, maybe someone will hear from<br>
her.  If I were a local I would just go on up there after not hearing<br>
via e-mail and postal mail to her address and revamp the box.  I'd<br>
carve my own stamp and just put it in there, put in a new smaller log<br>
book, and hide it the way a letterbox should be hidden, strictly for<br>
the sake of letterboxing's good name.  I'm not local, and I wouldn't<br>
want to step on toes as a guest in your state, just my opinion as to<br>
something that could be done without any guilt.  One of the first<br>
people I met to learn about letterboxing told me an untended box is<br>
considered "trash."  That's a bit harsh, because there are so many<br>
people who place boxes all over the place and can't possibly tend to<br>
them, but they at least stay in touch with the letterboxing site and<br>
allow others to adopt them or tend to them if they like.  Placing a<br>
box and then never coming back to the web site or the physical site to<br>
check on it seems kind of like abandonment to me, in which case anyone<br>
interested should not feel bad about tending to it.  <br>
<br>
I will certainly come back here and let you all know if mailing the<br>
postcard to her house results in anything at all.  <br>
<br>
Again, I sure loved your beautiful state - JeLyBean told me a critter<br>
has been chewing on the box I left you - hope it got frustrated and<br>
gave up and doesn't come back to do further damage.  <br>
<br>
Happy New Year to you all.<br>
