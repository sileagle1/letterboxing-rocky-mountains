Once you find the location of your starting point park and follow the <br/>
red path to a large yellow circle. Continue on the red path to a <br/>
smaller yellow circle. Leave the circle and the red path to the south <br/>
heading towards a flowing body of water. Go through the fence posts <br/>
and in front of you there is a rusty bridge. Located below "inside" <br/>
the "ribs" of the bridge on the left you will find the black <br/>
magnetic "Big Dog Letterbox" hiding. Make sure to reach carefully <br/>
inside for the box and watch out for screws.<br/>
<br/>
Continue over the bridge and once you reach the Greenbelt take the <br/>
dirt path to your left. Note the round green wooden posts on your <br/>
left. Start counting from the first round green wooden post until you <br/>
reach the 45th post. Stop. Turn and face the river. Standing at the <br/>
edge of the path take 4 careful steps down the hill towards the water <br/>
or two cautious paces. "Big Dog Barks" is hidden under the rocks at <br/>
your feet behind a triangle shaped rock that is hidden under a larger <br/>
rock that acts as a ledge. The box is directly across from the 45th <br/>
post so align yourself from there. The box is not as far down as the <br/>
tree that is to your right if you are now facing up hill as you <br/>
search the rocks with your back to the river. Please watch your <br/>
footing as some of these rocks are loose. <br/>
<br/>
Should you note the box missing or its contents in bad repair please <br/>
