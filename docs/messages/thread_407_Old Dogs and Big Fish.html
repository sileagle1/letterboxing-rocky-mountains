The drizzling rain held off long enough today for me to head down to <br>
the river to check on Big Fish.  I pulled him out of the now <br>
leafless Nightshade bush and found him a perfect home further down <br>
the trail.  While there I found the sweetest little old dog, Sadie <br>
Dog HH, waiting patiently for a ride.  I was going to leave Sadie <br>
there for the next person, but people come along so seldom down <br>
there and she looked at me with such sweet, wistful eyes that I <br>
relented and brought her home.  She's curled up in front of the fire <br>
sleeping and dreaming of a road trip next week where I'll find her a <br>
new home and she can wait for her next family to take her in for a <br>
spell. <br>
<br>
It was a lovely day. <br>

That's great, Es. That Big Fish deserves a good cozy home. Are you <br>
sure you saw a dog? That fish appears different to everybody. When I <br>
saw it, I thought it was a '53 Buick.<br>
