But our fortune changed when the good buccaneer Esmerelda sailed into <br/>

fetching of essentials, and her greatest deed was the lifting of our <br/>
spirits; turning our travails into joyous adventure.<br/>

So even though the Pirate's Code is to leave behind those who fall <br/>
behind, Esmerelda noted that the Code is really more of a guideline <br/>
and used her discretion to help the poor seafarers.<br/>

Thanks Es! You are, and will always be, the Greatest Buccaneer Ever!<br/>
