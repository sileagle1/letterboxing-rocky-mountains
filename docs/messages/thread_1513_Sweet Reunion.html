When I got home from work yesterday I found my long lost luggage <br>
sitting on my doorstep. The logbook had been opened and was in a <br>
different part of the bag than it started in, but it was intact. (Too <br>
bad my luggage wasn't able to pick up a stamp or two that would let me <br>
know where it's been).<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the well-wishng and encouragement I recieved while it <br>
was gone. Most of the other folks I told about the loss of my logbook <br>
just didn't quite get how important it is to me.<br>
<br>
And it looks like my karma is recovering too, because I got my journal <br>
and stamp back just in time to head out he door with La Paloma and our <br>
new dog "Linus"..... for Indian Creek, Utah.<br>

Linus is an Australian Code-Cracking Dog, also known as a Blue <br>

We found two letterboxes at Indian Creek (Great stamps and hidden in <br>

It has been 24 years since I've had a dog and I haven't really <br>

dogs aren't allowed on trails even if they are leashed (Duh!). So we <br>

the wind.<br>

After we had our fill of that comedy we decided that Moab would be <br>
more fun..........and it was! Linus proved to be a mellow tent-mate <br>
and the canyons blocked the wind. We didn't have any Moab clues with <br>
us, so I decided to show La Paloma a few letterboxes on a dog-<br>

Linus is adorable, I hope to meet him soon.  My four-year-old boxing <br>
buddy, Finbar, recommends having his own stamp and Personal Traveler <br>
(or "canine traveler", as Allemeyn calls it). Boxing with a dog is <br>
lots of fun, and dogs can make great diversions as you grab a box. <br>

is that we have a couple of Blue Stampers as well, and one of them, Highway (guess where <br>

Linus is as smart as Highway, you're in for a great time. If Highway had thumbs, he would <br>
