New letterbox: Fountain Creek<br/>
Fountain, El Paso County, CO<br/>
Placed by: Kallaya<br/>
Box webpage located at: Webmaster<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
 The Fountain Creek letter box is located in Fountain Creek Regional <br/>
Park, 5 miles south of Colorado Springs. It is mostly flat terrain, <br/>
great for kids. It takes about 20 minutes to get to the box walking <br/>
at a moderate pace. Restrooms, drinking fountain and maps are located <br/>
at the Nature Center (open Tues-Sat 9-4).<br/>
<br/>
Directions- Take I25 South to exit 132 Hw. 16. Go east over the <br/>
highway. Take the first exit on the right to Hw. 85. At the stop sign <br/>
turn right onto Hw. 85. Travel south for .5 miles. Turn right on <br/>
Cattail Marsh Rd. (Fountain Nature Center Sign). Go to the end of the <br/>
dirt road .2 miles and park in the parking lot. Begin walking on the <br/>
concrete path in front of the Nature Center. Go down the hill and <br/>
cross the bridge. At the first fork in the trail stay to the right. <br/>
Pass "Grandpa Cottonwood" on your left and at the fork go left. <br/>
Anne's bench will be on your right as you continue down the path. Go <br/>
through the gazebo and at the next fork stay to the right. You should <br/>
be walking above the pond which is on your right. Check out the <br/>
Dabblers and Divers at the overlook on your right. Continue down the <br/>
trail. Stop at the second bench on your right. Stand with your back <br/>
to the back of the bench. You should be facing West toward the creek <br/>
and mountains, not the pond. Take 12 paces across the trail and stop <br/>
at the edge. In front of you is a very large boulder that even <br/>
Hercules couldn't lift. To the right of this boulder is a large rock. <br/>
You'll find the Ftn. Creek letter box under the rock. Take the box to <br/>
the bench so as not to reveal its location. Replace the box, <br/>
carefully concealing it. The grass will be gone in the winter and the <br/>
rock will be visible from the trail. You can continue on down the <br/>
trail to a picnic area. On your return trip after passing Anne's <br/>
bench, go left at the fork across the bridge. This trail will take <br/>
you back up to the parking lot. Enjoy! <br/>
