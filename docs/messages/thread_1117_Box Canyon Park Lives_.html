                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well it took me about a week after Esmerelda reported this box missing <br/>
before I remembered to edit the clues. That was the best mistake I <br/>
made that day because Echo and Jessi had already printed those clues <br/>
and went looking for it. And when they saw that it was gone they put <br/>
one of their own stamps and a logbook together and hid it in the same <br/>
place. So this letterbox has found new life in the kindness of it's <br/>
visitors. <br/>
<br/>
Since I didn't originally place this box I was not planning on <br/>
replacing it. But I couldn't be happier that it is alive <br/>
again, "owned" by Jessi, Echo, Floating Feather, and myself, (but <br/>
really having a life of it's own).<br/>
<br/>
A big thanks to Jessi and Echo,<br/>
Viva Box Canyon!<br/>

y-nought...who can't wait to stamp in to the new one...<br/>
