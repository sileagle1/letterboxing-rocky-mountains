I tried to go check on this box this weekend, but there is a fence, <br>
and a gate around the entire parking lot to the ren fest. We couldn't <br>
get anywhere near it without arousing some serious suspicion. You <br>
would have to park outside on the street somewhere and then jump the <br>
fence to get anywhere near the fence.<br>
<br>
Sorry! We did try, we even thought about sneaking in, but a police <br>
officer stopped to ask if we needed any help, and we took that as a <br>
sign to move on.<br>
<br>
I wish I could have been more help!<br>

It was so kind of you guys to go to so much trouble and so far out <br>
of the way to check on that. Thank you!<br>
<br>
I had no idea they fenced the whole place off in the winter.. duh.. <br>
way to research, Es. <br>
<br>
I'll make a replacement and put it outside the property soon.<br>
<br>
Thanks again!<br>
