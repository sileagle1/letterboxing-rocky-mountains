       I posted clues for a new letterbox earlier this week. Campus <br>
in the Sky is in town and therefore accessible this time of year. I <br>
have handed clues to a few people, hoping to generate some interest. <br>
Looking forward to the day I start seeing local stamps in the boxes <br>
around here.<br>
       As I was perusing a topo map I realized that the Engineer <br>
Mountain box is in fact just over the county line in San Juan County. <br>
When I changed the county on the clues it of course moved them to the <br>
Western Slope clue list.<br>
        The box is in the same place, it just looks like it flew <br>
across the state.<br>
       Happy Stamping,<br>
