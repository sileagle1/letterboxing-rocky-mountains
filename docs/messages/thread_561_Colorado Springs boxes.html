Okay, I know I haven't checked in for sometime, but, I gotta tell <br>
you all that I feel that I need a reward for my latest letterbox <br>
adventure....pie would be great, ES!<br>
<br>
Anyway, we spent Friday boxing in the Springs.  Gorgeous day!  It <br>
happened to be our 26th Wedding Anniversary and I couldn't have had <br>
a funner day!  Our first box, Garden of the Goddesses, awarded us as <br>
first finders!  WHOO-HOO!  We were thrilled!  Thanks Goddesses!  <br>
Then we stopped for the second one in the area, Red Rock Canyon.  <br>
This park is so beautiful and we had the best time.<br>
<br>
On to Pikes Peak.  Our luck changed and it appears that the Cog Rail <br>
LB went amissing.  We then went up Pikes Peak Road for the Pikes <br>
Peak LB.  More bad luck.  We found the box, but NO STAMP!  It <br>
appears that the stamp has been missing since it was placed (the <br>
First Finders wrote "NO STAMP").  So, just FYI!  But, The lake was <br>
beautiful and relatively warm day for March. But, it was getting <br>
late.... <br>
<br>
So, we went to our last Letterbox of the day....UTE PASS!  <br>
JELYBEAN!  You scared the living daylights out of me!  At the very <br>
least, I have more white hair then I did at the beginning of the <br>
day!  Now, you did WARN us with your clues, but, in our haste to get <br>
going that morning, we printed the clues without reading them....of <br>
course, we didn't have a flashlight!  We did have our hiking sticks <br>
and that helped immensely with the climb...wouldn't do it without <br>
them!  But, TUNNEL #3 is a very, very, PITCH BLACK tunnel and your <br>
imagination runs wild when you can't even see a pin prick of <br>
light!!  YOW!  But, the stamp was well worth it! Coincidentally, we <br>
were married on the old D&RG Winter Park Ski Train and so the train <br>
stamp was very appropriate for us to find on our Anniversary!  Alls <br>
well that ends well, but, I would love some pie for an extra <br>
reward....I mean this was scarier than any FEAR FACTOR stunt!<br>
<br>
Home safe and sound and looking forward to more adventures in boxing!<br>
<br>
Hugs, Dixie  <br>

Woohooo!!! That sounds like a wonderful fun way to spend an <br>
anniversary!  Even the scary part!<br>
<br>
You should get TWO pieces of pie.. once for each direction through <br>
the tunnel.  I looked it up in the rule book. <br>
<br>
Es, stricken with a near fatal case of boxing spring fever<br>

Dix - The first time I went up there I didn't have a flashlight <br>
either.  About halfway through tunnel 3 a flock of pigeons took wing <br>
suddenly and let's just say I wish I'd been wearing a diaper.  So, <br>
welcome to the I-Got-The-S**t-Scared-Out-Of-Me-At-Ute-Pass Club.  T-<br>
Shirts are available in the gift shop.<br>
<br>
Anyway, glad I could reward you with a train on your anniversary.  <br>
Too bad about Cog Rail, that was a really nice train stamp as well.<br>
