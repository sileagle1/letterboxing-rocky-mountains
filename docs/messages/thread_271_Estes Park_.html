                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Debbi - well, let me tell you about the Rocky Mountain Wedding <br>
box - there are three "Crosier Mountain" Trails (or access to that <br>
trail) in the Glen Haven area.  Not knowing this, my friend and I <br>
went out a couple weeks ago to get the box, and we were apparently <br>
on the WRONG trail!!!  It was a very steep climb, and we had been <br>
hiking for about 2 1/2 miles before we even got to a fork (which was <br>
supposed to be a mile).  After looking around and being very puzzled <br>
by the lack of any landmarks mentioned in the clues, we gave up and <br>
headed back down the trail.  We ran into someone who informed us <br>
that there are three trails, and we deduced we were on the wrong <br>
one.  So, I THINK the correct trail is the one that actually starts <br>
in the town of Glen Haven (by the horse stables), instead of the one <br>
about 2 miles east of the town (and there's another one even further <br>
east).  At least that's what it looked like on the topo map.  Lesson <br>
learned: these are *clues*, not so much directions - always check <br>
the topo map!!!  We'll be trying again in the next couple weeks.<br>
<br>
As for kids, it might be a rough hike.  It was GORGEOUS up there - <br>
great views, wildflowers and rocks, but it was a little steep (hey, <br>
it's a mountain after all).  If you go, bring lots of water!<br>
<br>
By the way, I'll be planting a box really soon at Horsetooth <br>
Mountain Park in Fort Collins - I've got the stamp carved and I just <br>
need to get the box together.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Cattail  :)<br>
