                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was wondering if you all may want to help me with our local search<br>
which is a lot like Y's in Durango.  We are looking for a rock hidden<br>
somewhere in Northern Colorado.  This is a larger black rock with little<br>
green specks on it. I am missing one clue from today and do not have the<br>
last clue word for word, however I will post them tomorrow if the stone<br>
has not been found.  Any help would be GREAT!  Thanks!  Ramdelt<br>
 <br>
The clues so far have been:<br>
 <br>
1.       Some advice to start out week five.<br>
You have to LOOK CLOSE when you seek. <br>
            Think of where we haven't been,<br>
            That's where you'll find the blarney this week.<br>
 <br>
2.       The Original King of Late Night times three,<br>
Then just a few paces to the northwest.<br>
These boxes aren't really necessary here,<br>
For this is where the water flows best.<br>
 <br>
3.       High in the sky the watch over the blarney.<br>
During the day, but especially at night.<br>
Most with just one, but some with two.<br>
Blue is what you need to have in your sight.<br>
 <br>
4.       Fred, Barney, Wilma, and Betty.<br>
This foursome nearby watches and checks.<br>
The town, the trees and the path below,<br>
Look for the one with little green specks.<br>
 <br>
5.       All around to the east of the blarney,<br>
Warnings tell you what not to do.<br>
A letter, a line and a post for good measure,<br>
Will prevent financial ruin from coming to you.<br>
 <br>
6.       Some play with, some play without.<br>
But we all have one above our head.<br>
Three up, three down, they scream from the pavilions.<br>
As does the leprechaun resting in his bed.<br>
 <br>
7.       A famous song can tell it all,<br>
Especially when two colors become one.<br>
But a certain lyric will lead the way,<br>
To where the search for the Blarney will be done.<br>
 <br>
8.       Finding the blarney and winning the green<br>
Will surely make your day.<br>
East of Woody and also Toby,<br>
And baby you're on your way.<br>
            <br>
9.       You'd think the beach was to the south,<br>
For what you see up in the sky.<br>
Not a ball, not a Frisbee, not a seagull.<br>
But the place where you hear the waves crash by.<br>
            <br>
10.   Take a big yellow taxi to the scene<br>
The far west side of paradise is peaceful if you know what I mean.<br>
 <br>
11.   (Something like) The artist of Sunflowers who cut off his ear's<br>
last name goes to bed here<br>
Once you find it, everything will become clear.<br>
