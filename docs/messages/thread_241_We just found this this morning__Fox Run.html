in a different spot, and neither time was it anywhere near where the <br/>
clues led me!  The last time I found it about three weeks ago, it <br/>
was very poorly hidden.  You can tell by looking at the log book <br/>
that many, many people have stumbled upon it by accident, all of <br/>
them putting it back safe and sound. Maybe we didn't get lucky this <br/>
time?<br/>
