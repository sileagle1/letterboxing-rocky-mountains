<br>
>Hey everyone!<br>
<br>
Let's all get together and talk shop. Transfer and carving techniques, logbook creation, pouch making, etc, etc.<br>
<br>
The always spectacular Tai Chi and Chai Tea have been generous enough to find an indoor venue for us to meet in.<br>
<br>
Couple of notes:<br>
<br>
1. I am NOT going to carve an event stamp for this. I'm sure there will be some new folks, and feel free to exchange if there is time!<br>
<br>
2. This won't be your typical meet-and-greet. I had gotten several requests to share how I do what I do, and my plan is to do this in a seminar or workshop type setting. As a result, I am limiting this to ages 12 and older. I love all of your wolflings! Please don't get me wrong, I don't want to offend. But I am gearing this toward an older audience. Let's see how this goes, and maybe we can talk about a kid-specific workshop in the future.<br>
<br>
I'm still working on all the details. Look for a materials list to be posted within the next two weeks. Don't panic! I won't be making you bring any specialty items. Everything can be bought at any of the local craft stores, or brought from your own stashes.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing you all!<br>
<br>
