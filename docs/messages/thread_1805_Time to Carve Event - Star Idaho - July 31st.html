We are hoping to have the new boxers in our area join us next weekend for a little 1-on-1 carving time. A big thank you to Capperpillar for arranging the event and to A-Bear for opening her home.<br>

July 31, 2010<br>
4:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m.<br>
Star, Idaho<br>
Snacks will be provided<br>
<br>
Details:<br>
<br>
A group of us are going to get together for a carving workshop. If you're new to carving, this should be a great opportunity to find out more about transfer techniques, carving tools, carving material, and more. Contact me (Capperpillar) for the address of the location.<br>
<br>
Bring some images that you would like to try to carve. If you have carving tools and supplies, bring them along, too. If you don't have any yet, that's fine. I'll bring all of my stuff so you can try out some different things.<br>
<br>
If you're looking for images online, the image search on google has advanced search settings where you can limit your search to "line drawings". If you find something that's not a line drawing, that's fine, too.<br>
<br>
There's a free online pencil sketch tool that converts jpg, gif, or png files into line drawings. You can find it at http://www.dumpr.net/sketch.php. It works better for some images than others. Sometimes it helps to mess with the brightness and contrast of the image first.<br>
