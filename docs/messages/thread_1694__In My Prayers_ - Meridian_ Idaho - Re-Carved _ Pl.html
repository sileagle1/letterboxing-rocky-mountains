Clue Difficulty: Easy<br>
Terrain Difficulty: Easy  <br>
Wheelchair Accessible:  Yes<br>
Child Friendly:  Yes<br>
Pet Friendly:  No<br>
Number of Boxes: 1<br>
Hand Carved Stamps:  Yes<br>
Stamp Pad/Ink:  No<br>
<br>
5/3/2009 - Box replanted.  Carving the same but smaller with more detail.  Clues altered slightly.  Make sure to print the clues for Nightmare Before Christmas:  Jack Skellington & Sally:  http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=58407  They are alive and well at Joplin Cemetery too.<br>
<br>
Special Notes:  Joplin Cemetery is your destination.  Pets are not allowed in the cemetery.  The cemetery is open 8:00 a.m. to sundown seven days a week.<br>
<br>
Joplin Cemetery has a memorial to commemorate the cemetery.  It reads:  To the memory of the pioneer families who came to this valley in 1880.  This sacred place is reserved and perpetuated just as they found it dry and desolate.  Many were the hardships and privations they endured.  Dedicated to the spirit of the old timers and pioneers.<br>
Location:  Joplin Cemetery located at 4700 East Chinden Boulevard, Meridian, Idaho.  Chinden Boulevard & Joplin Road.<br>
<br>
Clues:  Enter the cemetery from Joplin Road through the chain link fence.  Take the paved path to the very northwest corner of the cemetery  section H near plots 183-186.  Locate Fay N. Beberness who lived from June 29, 1914 to March 12, 1999.  Directly behind Fay is a large round pine tree.  Hidden in the base of the tree as it splits into many smaller sections on the left hand side camouflages by two very thin rocks and a couple of twigs you will find this angel hiding.  Please place the box and rocks back securely as they are the key to keeping the box hidden from muggles.<br>
<br>
Should you note the box missing, its contents in bad repair or if you just want to say "Hi" please contact me at Blackvelvetrav@yahoo.com. Thank you & happy hunting!<br>
