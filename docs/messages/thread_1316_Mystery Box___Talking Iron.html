A Mystery Letterbox <br>
<br>
FIRST OF A SERIES OF LETTERBOXES FOR OUR OWN ROCKY MTN. PIRATE, <br>
Esmerelda...our favorite ducky! It's an "Ace in the Hole"!<br>
<br>
Fer all ya cowboys and cowgirls out thar, I jest wanted to bring yer <br>
attention to the fact that it's a Series! Yep, more than one.  How <br>
many, ya ask...shucks, I'm not gonna tell ya and ruin the fun fer the <br>
Posse! Now being a mystery and all, ya'll have to find the first box <br>
to get yerself the clues for the next and so on.  The other clues <br>
can't be found out any other way.  Unless ya'll willing to bribe the <br>
Posse with pie!  Har...jest a little joke thar! <br>
 <br>
Now seriously, the Posse done asked me to let ya'll know that since <br>
thar are more than one of these hidden around and about the state and <br>
the fact that ya'll might not be able to wander all over the state <br>
like them cowboys did, that we propose that if ya want the clues to a <br>
box that may be hidden in an area that ya'll live or will be <br>
traveling to AND you don't intend to find the whole series in order, <br>
that you jest feel free Pony Express me and ask me fer the clues to <br>
the box in yer interested location!!  Phew...Clear as mud??? My head <br>
is spinning...need to get some shut eye!  But, one catch...if the box <br>
hasn't been found yet, we reserve the right to wait until it's been <br>
found the proper way, by doing the series in order...after that, <br>
ya'll can hunt till yer hearts content!  That's all I got to say, <br>
except....<br>
<br>
Yeehaw!  Giddy-up for a rootin' tootin' time!<br>

Mother Nature know that I'm on a mission from the Posse?!<br>
<br>
Y'all need to get yerself these clues and start your adventure.. <br>
Skeetch and I are having a blast!  These are excellent boxes filled <br>
with fun things and located near fun people!  hehehehehe!  They're a <br>
bunch of fibbers, but they're fun.  We're discovering some great new <br>
places as we learn some interesting history along the way.  I won't <br>
tell you how many we've found or where they are because the posse <br>
would likely string me up.  But I'll tell you that I highly recommend <br>
the journey!  Eeeee-ha!<br>

first box, TALKIN IRON, to the next and so forth....nah, I'm not <br>
messin' up again and telling ya how many boxes...figer it out <br>
yerself....<br>
<br>
BUT, there are boxes that ya'll would get a kick at, from the Front <br>
Range (Denver and burbs south to the Springs) all the way up in them <br>
thar hills to the Western slope and of course even down Durango <br>
way...ya'll know Cowboys love to travel!  So, git yerself started and <br>
the Talkin Iron will "Talk" ya into another and then another...!!!  <br>
And, have fun...there are some cowboy tricks and surprises awaitin' <br>
ya!  Yippee cay yo cay yea!!!  Now skidaddle to the first box!!!<br>

Jest Peach....flushed with embarassment about messin' up an important <br>
message from the Posse! <br>
