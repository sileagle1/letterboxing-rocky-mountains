that correct?  There's been a thread on AQ about Final Boxes: <br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/boards/messages.html?gMsgId=559415&gThreadId=8\<br>
0930  (Read the whole thread.)  Kind of an interesting concept.  I know<br>
Holly truly enjoyed poking around in cemeteries and I wondered if those<br>
of you who are creating her memorial letterbox might consider something<br>
along this line, or planting in a cemetery.  Does Denver have a<br>
columbarium?  There's a beautiful one in San Francisco and there's been<br>
a letterbox/geocache hybrid there sitting in plain sight since 2003: <br>

Just throwing this idea out for what it's worth,<br>
