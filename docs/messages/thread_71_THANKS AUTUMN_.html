coming up with "gold"!  What fun we all had and now we are newly <br/>
inspired to find more and plant more!  My friend Jyl is new to <br/>
letterboxing and would like to host something at her house.  I will <br/>
check with her and post for her....I need to get her up to speed on <br/>
this site and how it works.  <br/>
<br/>
Welcome Phoenix, et. all....look forward to meeting you at the next <br/>
one along with everyone else who wasn't able to make it.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to you again, Autumn!<br/>
