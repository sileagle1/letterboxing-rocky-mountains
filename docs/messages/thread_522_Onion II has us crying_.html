Ed, HELP us PLEASE!  *sob*  We have spent countless hours upon hours <br/>
trying to decipher the "inner layer" of the onion and need another <br/>
clue!  We have tried oh so many things and feel that we must be <br/>
making it harder than it is.  Please email me off list if you can <br/>
part with a bit of a hint...I can tell you what we've tried and <br/>
maybe we just need to tinker with it a bit, we feel we must be on <br/>
the right track...  Me oh my O, that Onion is a stinker! <br/>
<br/>
Hugs, Dixie<br/>
