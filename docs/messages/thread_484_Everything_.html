Wow, you guys covered some ground today! Interesting stuff, that <br>
hiker's insurance. We don't have that here in Utah, but I wonder if <br>
I got it in Colorado for when we hike in Colorado, if it would cover <br>
us if we are residents of Utah? Did that even make sense?<br>
<br>
Bad dog indeed! My dogs get the blame for a lot of things, but <br>
luckily it hasn't entered their minds to chew stamps.....yet!<br>
<br>
Es, that Left Hand box is back in place today. You know what they <br>
say, "Fourth time is a charm". OK, maybe not.<br>
