Where is everyone! We just got home from a trip out to CA and did <br/>
some wonderful boxing on the way to and from. Finally made it to <br/>
Navajo Code Talkers, Monument Valley, and Mexican Hat letterboxes, <br/>
as well as some others!<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone had a great holiday! It appears as if everyone is in a <br/>
turkey and leftovers stupor! LOL<br/>

Now THAT is what I call contacting the placer! A dose of my own <br/>
medicine. Sounds like a great trip, Kat.<br/>

Welcome home, Kat!<br/>
<br/>
I think everyone went to Wyoming or something.  The clubhouse has <br/>
been empty all week.  I made sure all the pies were safe, though. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter and I will be driving from Phoenix to Disneyland next <br/>
week and I'm hoping we can find a few boxes along the way.  Any <br/>
suggestions?   I'd try and plant one in the Park, but I bought the <br/>
parkhopper passes without the full body cavity search option.  I bet <br/>
it wouldn't last 12 seconds in that place and I don't look good in <br/>
jail-house orange.  But I figure there must be some on the way!<br/>
