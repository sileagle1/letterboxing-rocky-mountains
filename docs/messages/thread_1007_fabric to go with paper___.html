I realized in reading them that I should have shared my own <br/>
recommendation for scoring fantastic fabric for anyone who wants to do <br/>
fabric covers.  It's an online store only based in Boulder called <br/>
www.equilter.com  They are the best I've found for what, in quilting <br/>
cirlces (ha) is called "novelty fabric."  If you do a search on their <br/>
site with those key words you'll be amazed what they have to fit just <br/>
about any theme. <br/>

I was in Guery's today (still think I'm spelling it wrong) and they <br/>
had an impressive supply of some pretty sweet handmade paper.  They <br/>
have stores scattered around the east slope.<br/>

dragging some away to go into the secret pirate stash<br/>
