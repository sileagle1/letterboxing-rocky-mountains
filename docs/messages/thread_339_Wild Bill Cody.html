We went to visit Wild BIll Cody on Saturday.  What a beautiful box.  This<br>
is the third box of yours that I have found and I believe the most<br>
beautiful.  Thank you.  It was hidden well and in good condition.  We did<br>
not have a lot of time to hang out in the area becuase it started to<br>
sprinkle and we did not want it to get wet.<br>
Thanks again<br>

Thanks so much!  I kind of worry about him up there in such a busy <br>
place and it's so good to hear he's doing well!<br>
<br>
I sure had fun making and placing it...Bill is my kindred spirit. <br>
Same birthdays and all. <g> <br>
