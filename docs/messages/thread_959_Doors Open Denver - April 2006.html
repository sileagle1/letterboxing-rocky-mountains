strictly-speaking letterboxing event...but I thought you might be <br/>
interested, and with a enough warning, maybe those of you from further <br/>
afield than the Front Range might be able to make plans to attend -<br/>
 'cause it IS an exploring event, just like boxing!<br/>
<br/>
The second annual Doors Open Denver dates for 2006 dates have just been <br/>
announced. <br/>
<br/>
Second annual Doors Open Denver<br/>
April 22 - 23, 2006<br/>
http://www.denvergov.org/doorsopendenver/<br/>
<br/>
I went to the first one last year.  Only planned on one day, but ended <br/>
up going back on Sunday for more.<br/>
<br/>
Highlights for me included - going UNDER the stage at the Paramount <br/>
Theatre with volunteers who play the organs there (only one of 2 <br/>
theatres like it in the entire country), a tour of the Presidential <br/>
Suite at the Brown Palace, the Miniature Railway Museum in the basement <br/>
of Union Station (usually opened only about one day a month), the <br/>
Governors Mansion was open for the day (it has very limited hours for <br/>
tours), downtown/LoDo lofts...including some private residences with <br/>
bazillion dollar views, Capitol Hill Mansions almost never open to the <br/>
public, a guided tour of the Denver Press Club with working journalist, <br/>
and so on.  My friend and I barely scratched the surface of the 80+ <br/>
buildings which were open for the weekend...even in two days!<br/>
<br/>
You never know - there just might be some letterboxes placed in time <br/>
for the event, or perhaps a meet could be organized! <br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned on the link for when the map/guide of which lists the <br/>
locations participating this year comes out, and on this list for <br/>
boxing-specific info as the dates draw closer.<br/>
<br/>
