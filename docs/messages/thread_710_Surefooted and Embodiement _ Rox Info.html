know where they are but have not looked for them - yet!!   <br>

News from Roxborough State Park:  I spoke with the new manager out <br>
there and she was very open to Letterboxes - but on a limited basis.  <br>
I told her I already had two planted and must get  them approved this <br>
week - or they may be replaced.  She told me they now have geocaches - <br>
letterboxes and something called virtual boxes or sites or something.  <br>
Anyone know about this?  Can't be as fun - it's done on the computer.  <br>
