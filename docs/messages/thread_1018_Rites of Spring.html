   Funny you should mention the wittle birdies, because I've been <br>
seeing even stranger things. I just saw that dilbox Charlie Papazian <br>
looking around for a missing piece (of what, I don't know). It's a good <br>
thing his gaurd dog was along to help with his master's vision. After <br>
that I had to come back to Durango and relax.....have a home carved.<br>
<br>
Those sunny afternoons are giving me Spring Fever.<br>

I had actually planned to stay awhile in yer fair city. But the <br>
scurvy dogs at a certain company told me to go to Denver for a class <br>
being held in Tucson. After driving up there I turned around and <br>
drove back. If I hadn't had some clues with me, it would have been a <br>
total waste of time. <br>

Next time I'll let ye know,<br>

ya, that would indeed have been a bummer!  How in the world did they <br>
mix up Denver with Tucson!  Although lately the weather may be much <br>
the same!  Hope you will find time to come back soon...we would love <br>
to see ya!<br>

<br>
P.S.  Did you drive home via I-70???<br>
