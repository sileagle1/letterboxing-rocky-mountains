&gt; wittle birdies every morning are starting to make it sound a lot <br/>
&gt; like spring in Denver.  Bring on Boxing Season!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
   Funny you should mention the wittle birdies, because I've been <br/>
seeing even stranger things. I just saw that dilbox Charlie Papazian <br/>
looking around for a missing piece (of what, I don't know). It's a good <br/>
thing his gaurd dog was along to help with his master's vision. After <br/>
that I had to come back to Durango and relax.....have a home carved.<br/>

Those sunny afternoons are giving me Spring Fever.<br/>

I had actually planned to stay awhile in yer fair city. But the <br/>
scurvy dogs at a certain company told me to go to Denver for a class <br/>
being held in Tucson. After driving up there I turned around and <br/>
drove back. If I hadn't had some clues with me, it would have been a <br/>
total waste of time. <br/>

ya, that would indeed have been a bummer!  How in the world did they <br/>

P.S.  Did you drive home via I-70???<br/>
