In New Zealand, we say "kiwi" to mean the bird, and "kiwi fruit" to <br>
mean the green furry fruit.  So when I read your message my first <br>
thought was, "Yuck - Kiwi [bird] pie!  Poor endangered Kiwis!".<br>
<br>
And then I realised you meant a fruit pie. <grin><br>
<br>
I'm glad the letterbox is approved.  Those rangers at Cherry Creek <br>
are good by the sounds of it.  <br>

I wonder if Kiwi pie would taste like chicken pie?<br>
<br>
The ranger in charge was great and got the form right back to me.  It <br>
showed up in the mailbox just a few days after I sent it to them with <br>
a big APPROVED stamped on it.  I actually had cake to celebrate.  But <br>
I'll have pie this weekend just to extend the celebration.  I mean, <br>
come on.  Life... she is good.<br>
<br>
Es, a celebrationriffic<br>

I know the Ranger is supposed to be more of a manager than a <br>
participant, but it would be REALLY cool if they would stamp APPROVED <br>
in the logbook.<br>
<br>
On second thought, I might need to buy one of those APPROVED stamps <br>
for myself. I've already rescued a FIRST CLASS stamp from the trash. <br>
It comes in handy when I make birthday cards--- or when I need to <br>
express how I feel about pie.<br>
