OMG That's horrible!  I've been so out of the loop on letterboxing <br/>
lately, I didn't even know she was sick.  What a horrible loss.  I'm <br/>

<br/>
Aljan, buddy, if ever there was a collaboration between the two of us, this should be it! I don't want to step on any toes, there were certainly those among us who knew Holly better than the two of us, but I  would love to contribute in some small way to her memory.<br/>
<br/>
A *HUGE* hug to our Colorado angels - Tai Chi and Chai Tea who I know spent a great deal of their time and energy with Holly lately. Our dear moderator Kat who reports that Holly was in good spirits this past Wednesday. And to anyone else who got a chance to brighten her days as she struggled with this illness. <br/>
<br/>
She certainly left her mark upon us these last 5 years. With her eclectic posts, and funny hat - she won't be forgotten any time soon. =3 <br/>
<br/>
So, we raise our glass, and our thoughts to one of our own. Happy Howls Preboxed. May we meet on the trails in the next great adventure.<br/>

Holly was one of the all time letterboxing greats!  She had more cleverness, passion and commitment to this game in her little finger than I have in my whole logbook.<br/>

I am so fortunate that I got to do that 'boxing marathon day with her and Joan.....great memory!  She will be sorely missed.<br/>

 <br/>
I think that her illness has also underscored for me just how many great people we have in our little boxing circle.  AutumnsFolly buoyed Holly's spirits while she was undergoing chemo and radiation.  TaiChi and ChaiTea showed Holly great kindness and watched over her when she was ill.  Already people are thinking about how best to honor her memory.  We're so lucky to have such people among our friends.<br/>
<br/>
Holly loved letterboxing, and I suspect that she would love the idea of a gathering in her honor and would be especially touched by the idea of a RavenWolf/Aljan collaboration to honor her memory.<br/>

Holly was so lucky to have all of you. Thank you for taking care of her so well. Pre's "pre"sence will be greatly missed and wil leave a huge void not only in Colorado but throughout all of letterboxing. She had a huge personlity and no one will be able to fill her shoes. Please let me know if you think of anything that I can do to help.<br/>

<br/>
Tai &amp; Chi, do you think you could find out her favorite charity so I could make a donation in her name?  I think she would prefer that over flowers. <br/>
<br/>
As you guys probably know, April first was Pre's bday and fave holiday. I'd like to suggest you declare it national pre- day and have an event in her honor every year. It's on a Friday next year. <br/>

I am so disappointed I never got a chance to meet her. We just moved to CO and had talked to her before we moved about having a gathering. Now we will never get that chance.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Unfortunately, I have to work this Saturday (and no getting out of it).  Please keep us posted on the memorial times.  Holly's mother also said she wanted to hold a mass in Seattle (am I right about the location, Peg?).  <br/>
<br/>
When I spoke to Holly on Wednesday, as Dick &amp; Peg will attest, she was still her same self - full of "piss and vinegar" as my folks would have said.  Though her body was failing, her mind was not.  She was still funny and we shared a laugh, we both agreed that her dying "sucks", and then we shared a cry.  If you were among the many who did not know she was ill, it's because she was just that way - very private, PRE-ferring to hop online when she felt good, and put a witty quip on Atlas Quest.  You'd never know she'd been battling this for the last year and then some.    <br/>
<br/>
She did ask for a mini-meet in her honor, especially something that would pull the community together.  Dick &amp; Peg will be coordinating that, which is awesome.  She's asked that her letterboxes be adopted and her letterboxing things be shared "with those who will USE them". Hah! I'm sure all of those details will be worked out later.  I think a box carved for the meet and planted for her would be just a grand thing - thanks for the offer and suggestion RW.  <br/>
<br/>
Though I dont know her favorite charity to suggest a donation, Holly did have breast cancer, so a donation to Susan G. Komen would not be amiss.  <br/>
<br/>
I want to give a very special thank you to Dick &amp; Peg - TaiChi &amp; ChaiTea for their countless hours helping Holly.  You two were a literal godsend for her, and for her family.  Without TC&amp;CT, Holly's final days would have been much more challenging. I am deeply, deeply grateful. <br/>

I will have fond memories of meeting her in Breckenridge with Front Range Hiker, and at Live &amp; Breathe, where we formed our "High Five Gang." She truly did add a lot of fun to this hobby. May her PREsence linger on! <br/>

We had a lot of fun doing Doors Open Denver, LODO tour last year.  We shared a big laugh and will cherish our favorite letterboxing experience of her night box and giggling over Y trying to find Fandango.  We used to avoid Denver.  I told her that because of her, we now love it and can't wait to go back.  As Shurtugal said last year...we end up in a lot of cemetaries because of her... I wish this last one was for a letterbox.  We will miss you Pre.<br/>

<br/>
We've been quite out of the letterboxing loop lately, but we think of all of you with great fondness!  We will miss Holly.  She was so passionate about and dedicated to letterboxing.  Our most interesting adventure with Pre was going out with her to retrieve her Lariat Loop red box.  That box had its very own "rattling, fanged, and venomous keeper" . . .  a Prairie Rattlesnake in its summer den!<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, we can't make the memorial tomorrow, but our thoughts are with you and her family!  We may be able to come to the 9/25 memorial event.<br/>
<br/>
Much love,<br/>

One of my favorite boxing memories was doing Pre's boxes in Utah way back in<br/>
<br/>
the boonies. What a good day that was.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any idea how late you'll be at the park on Saturday?<br/>

My thoughts will be with you guys long-distance as you celebrate Holly's<br/>
life at her memorials and share your anecdotes about her.  There will be<br/>
much laughter, I'm sure! [:D]<br/>
