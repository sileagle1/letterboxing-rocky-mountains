Wow! I was doing a little Hibernating and I thought I heard someone <br>
say Fandango.<br>
<br>
Pre....I don't know what your schedule looks like, but I'm sure you <br>
would have fun if you came to Durango DURING the Silver Bullet <br>
Search. It's Jan 28 through Feb 1. Four clues a day and the whole <br>
town looking for a hidden treasure worth a few hundred dollars in <br>
coupons and merchandise. And the clues are cryptic and challenging <br>
enough to keep the amatuers confused. (And most of us veterans too).<br>
<br>
Plus...there is a crazy parade and about fifty other events to take <br>
in betweeen flashes of inspiration.<br>
<br>
This year the theme is "Durango in Da Nile", so an eqyptian outfit <br>
and makeup can really boost the fun level. Here's the link to this <br>
year's shindig: http://www.snowdown.org/ ......but they don't have <br>
the schedule posted yet.<br>
<br>
My job involves plowing snow, so the weather has a lot to do with how <br>
much I get to participate. Last year I didn't even get a chance to <br>
look for the Silver Bullet. I was, however, able to run over and <br>
enter the Cat-A-Pult contest after a ten-hour shift and take last <br>
place in that event. It was great fun tossing stuffed kitties with <br>
trebuchets while the crowd picketed against us with ASPCA signs that <br>
the event organizers handed out.<br>
<br>
Anyway....just thought I would toss that idea out there.....<br>
<br>
Oh!...and also I should say that the letterboxing is not so lonely <br>
around here anymore. There is an active 'boxer in Bayfield and a few <br>
in Farmington, New Mexico. Woot!<br>

It just so happens that I am dropping La Paloma off for a massage at <br>
5:00 today, a couple of blocks from there, and I'll have a half hour <br>
to kill......<br>
<br>
So you probably will be able to see a suspicious-looking fellow <br>
snooping around and scratching his head and doing whatever other <br>
contortions (Fandango?)it takes to "think like PRE".<br>
<br>
I have high hopes, but I know that sometimes I can be tripped up by <br>
the smallest things.<br>
<br>
Wish me luck,<br>
