Personally, I think by an large we are a warm, friendly, welcoming group.  Aren't we?  :-P  <br>
<br>
Yeah ... after reading the article I was rather bummed, too about our group being accused of being elitist.  (Again, these are not about your quotes, Joan).<br>

Oh Joan....please know that my "Ouch" comment in no way was a reflection on your section of the article (cute picture btw).  I was just bummed that on the one time there is an article focused on our group that it would reflect on one incident rather than the group as a whole.  I'm with Autumn....I have always felt that we have a special group here and I'm glad I can be a part! <br>
<br>
C'est la vie!<br>
<br>
Hugs, Peach<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh my, the article is a bit sharp at the end.  Its unfortunate the experience left a bad taste in her mouth.  I would have let it roll off my back personally and would have focused on my previous experiences (even just a few) vs. allowing someone to ruin my fun but I tend to be thick skinned.  I have found the Colorado boxers to be warm, friendly and wonderful to box with but as I said one sour apple would not have stopped me from my quest. <br>
 <br>
Some of her comments do worry me just a bit though.  I have lost upward of 25 boxes due to vandalism this past winter and 3 very recently AFTER re-posting my clues with restrictions (figure that one out).  I am forced at this juncture to protect my remaining boxes and only allow individuals I trust to have access to the clues (here in Idaho).  In Idaho because our population of active boxers is so low I realize I risk the appearance of being an elitist or letterboxing snob (nothing is further from the truth) but I am forced to these extreme measures based on the vandalism which has been largely out of my control.  This is my only way to regain control of my own boxes.  I never dreamed it would come to this.  It could be that the Colorado boxer mentioned was having the same things happen to her boxes as I have.<br>
<br>
We welcome any new boxers with open arms and are more than happy to show them the ropes from finding, to planting and even most recently holding a carving event.  I often send tips, tricks and ideas to new boxers to help them in any way I can.  I even get requests from out of state boxers for help.<br>
    <br>
I hope that the comments in the article are an isolated incident, miscommunication or maybe an incorrect perception.  With Geocachers taking over the world we just can't afford to lose any letterboxers (especially new and enthusiastic baby boxers). <br>
