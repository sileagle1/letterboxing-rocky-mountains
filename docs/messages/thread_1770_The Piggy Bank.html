We all spend a few bucks every time we plant or find a single letterbox. Why not set aside a few of those dollars from your letterboxing budget for those horribly unfortunate people living in Haiti? Help me out and let's see how generous we can be helping those who can't help themselves. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I donated via texting "HAITI" to 90999 - that puts $10 on your cell phone bill and it goes to the Red Cross.  There are lots of ways to support and contribute to Haitian relief efforts.  It's important to research your charity and make sure your donation dollars are doing the most good.  Thanks for the recommendations for those charities!! <br>
<br>
I also want to thank funhog for reminding us that supporting those in need is an important thing for every community to do.  And we have a totally awesome (if often quiet) community here!  :)  <br>
