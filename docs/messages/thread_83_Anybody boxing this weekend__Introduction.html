<br/>
I've been lurking for about a month and thought I should introduce <br/>
myself.  My name is Holly (aka Zenroxie) in Northern Utah.  I've been <br/>
letterboxing for 1 1/2 years, and I'm so excited about the growth of <br/>
Letterboxing in the Rockies!  When I planted my first box it was Utah's <br/>
3rd, and now there are almost 20.<br/>
<br/>
I'm amazed and inspired by A-Bear and Cadenza's work in Idaho.  Keep it <br/>
up!  Just think what could be accomplished in another year!<br/>
<br/>
This weekend I found A-Bear's "Rings" box and Heather's 2 "Teddy's <br/>
Waterhole" boxes in Utah.  They are all alive and well with frequent <br/>
visits.  I also planted a box near Bear Lake.  (The clues will be up as <br/>
soon as my film is developed.)  <br/>
<br/>
In addition to letterboxing I'm involved in The Carving Consortium <br/>
(http://theccforum.proboards9.com/) and Found-Art (found-art.com).  If <br/>
you enjoy carving and want to imporve your skills, the Carving Consortium <br/>
is a wonderful, fun, and supportive place to do it.<br/>
<br/>
The hardest part about planting boxes for me is writing the clues.  What <br/>
kind of clues do you like to write?  And what clues are your favorite to <br/>
decipher?<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all had a lovely weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Holly<br/>
