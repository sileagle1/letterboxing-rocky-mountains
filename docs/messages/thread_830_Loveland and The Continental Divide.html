I think that the one by Keystone may be missing due to what the directions state but I think "Continental Divide" and "Loveland" may still be there.  Long hikes to find out if they are still there or not but we would all like to know.<br>

Debbie - that is good news about Jeffco and our Letterboxes.  It will <br>
make it so much easier.  Hopefully, yours will turn up.   I am <br>
wondering how this will affect Roxborough - <br>
<br>
Does anyone know if the letterboxes on Loveland Pass are still<br>
there???<br>
I want to go real soon - maybe tomorrow - and look for them.  I will <br>
be moving to Phoenix sometime in September, so I must get busy and <br>
find those special ones that I have been wanting.     Puppypaws<br>
