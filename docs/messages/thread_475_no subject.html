Actually, I'm more partial to ice cream or swedish fish than to pie, <br/>
but I understand that pie is like the "food of the gods" to pirates! <br/>
LOL! <br/>

Welcome home, Es! I'm glad you could visit Lulu &amp; Ticaboo. Ok, admit <br/>
it, you had to throw rocks off that big pourover into the swimhole <br/>
below, didn't you guys? Did you break the ice? We didn't last time <br/>
we were there.<br/>

to plant!)<br/>

Quick! Plant them fast! We're coming back soon!!!  Like... tomorrow <br/>
maybe! Woot!!! ARrrrr!<br/>
<br/>
We didn't throw any rocks, I swear.  We were too busy scrambling up <br/>
and over to every rock that looked vaguely like a diving board in <br/>
the wrong place.  BWAH!  We had fun walking through the dark and <br/>
scary pipe of doom.  <br/>
<br/>
Why.. how did you know that pirates like pie? <br/>
<br/>
Es, especially anything with maaarrrangue on it. arrrrrrr. <br/>
