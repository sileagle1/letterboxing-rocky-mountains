                    <div class="plaintext-content">Kenna and I had sooooo much fun in Santa Fe last weekend! We boxed for <br/>
about 7 1/2 hours on Friday, and about 8 hours on Saturday, met a fun <br/>
new crew of boxers, had dinner and a good chat, and stamped to our <br/>
hearts content! Thank you Pre for the topper of the evening by <br/>
bringing PREcut quality paper for journals! And big thanks to the <br/>
talented Astro D and Lionsmane for putting together the event! <br/>

Santa Fe (we didn't get in until late on Saturday).  We spoke with <br/>
Rubberpeace and had hoped you all were meeting downtown somewhere so we <br/>
could stop by, but, alas, not to be!  We did love seeing that you had <br/>
stamped in and watched for a special jeep to come zooming by!  <br/>
<br/>
PRE we noticed an unfamiliar stamp with yours...Lore?! Welcome, <br/>
Lore...if you're not new to boxing you're just new to me! <br/>
<br/>
Rubberpeace...thanks for calling us back!  Sorry we couldn't attend!  <br/>
Next time!  We love all the boxes we did find and wish we had time for <br/>
more!  We'll be back for the boxes and the great food we found!<br/>
<br/>
Hugs, Dixie Peach...who was amazed to see snow flakes near the Plaza <br/>
Sunday morning....bbbrrrrrr...it was a chili..errr...chilly one!<br/>
