restaurant's general manager instead of chucking it away. The manager wrote me a note, <br/>
telling me 'how thrilled and excited' they are to have the box hidden away out there, and <br/>
offered to buy us lunch or dinner next time we're in GJ! Wow, hard to beat that!<br/>

Kat, I remember your Johnny Carino box....we got it on our way to the Moab gathering!  What <br/>
fun memories!  That is so darn COOL that they were excited and offered to buy you a meal!  I <br/>
love to hear happy endings like this!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, maybe I'll get a call from the super secret agents that uncovered Mile High and tell me <br/>
that I won a MILE HIGH trip to a secret destination!  <br/>
<br/>
Hugs, Dreadly <br/>

I love this story!  That's SO cool that they are happy to have the <br/>
letterbox there and even nicer that they offered you dinner.<br/>
<br/>
So glad that your story had a happy ending!<br/>
