I called the Forest Service about the road to Animas Overlook and they <br>
said that the tentative opening date for that road is MAY 1! Their <br>
website lists it as open now, but I checked last evening and it is <br>
indeed closed. I'm in the process of being a pest and trying to nudge <br>
them toward an earlier opening since we are having record high temps <br>
and I'm sure the snow is melting fast. We'll just have to see.<br>
<br>
I also finally got around to putting up revised clues for Celtic Tree <br>
after Tie Dye Girl told me about the new parking construction. In the <br>
process I found the container full of water (mixed with green ink). <br>
Happily the logbook baggie worked perfectly and all was saved. (The <br>
inkpad might be a bit weak, though).<br>

road opened early.  That would be very cool, I would like to do the <br>
Overlook while I am there.  I am bringing some goodies with me, and <br>
Es tells me there's a station or two still open up there.  If not, <br>
oh well, I find places for them.<br>
