                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well the security stuff is starting to kick in here in Denver for the <br>
DNC next week, including the following press release last week:<br>
<br>
"On Thursday, August 28th, I-25 will be closed from I-70 to 6th Ave. <br>
starting approzimately 5:30 p.m. for the Democratic National <br>
Convention Event at Invesco Field. The highway will remain closed <br>
until the conclusion of the event."<br>
<br>
I'm sure there will be much more security stuff to come.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, letterboxing in Central Denver until after next <br>
Thursday probably isn't the best idea.  I have pulled a few of my <br>
boxes, or made the clues go bye bye, for the time being.<br>
<br>
Ironically, the one on the topic of what's happening happening next <br>
week is the one least likely to be affected....<br>
<br>
Anyway, after next week all should be returned to normal.  I will <br>
post again only if that is NOT the case.<br>
