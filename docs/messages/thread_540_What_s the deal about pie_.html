Dear Boxer Lover, please do not ever say anything like "What's the <br/>
deal about pie?" on the Rocky Mountain Letterboxers and Pie Lovers <br/>
Talk List.  Comments like that are easily misconstrued by a bunch of <br/>
hungry pie lovers and may result in you getting hit in the face by a <br/>
whipped cream pie as you leave your house.<br/>
<br/>
Then you'll be attacked and eaten.<br/>
<br/>
JeLyBean, who thinks it was actually Esmerelda who started it...<br/>

You guys crack me up.<br/>
