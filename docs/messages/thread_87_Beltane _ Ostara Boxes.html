in good shape and it was a great walk!!  Had to turn back a couple of <br>
times on Ostara, but I eventually found it.  Probably just not paying <br>
too much attention!!  I did put the Ostara stamp and pad in a new <br>
Ziploc because the bag it was in was not sealable and was kinda icky <br>
with some ink.  Definately need bug spray if doing these boxes.  Trin <br>
and I both got bit up pretty good at Ostara before we put the bug <br>
repellant on.  Thanks Autumn for a great afternoon at a beautiful <br>
place!!<br>
<br>
Peace!!<br>
