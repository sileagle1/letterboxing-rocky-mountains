Locate the Welchester Tree Grant Park. Probably the best way to get <br>
there is to exit onto Indiana from 6th. Turn onto 7th and follow it <br>
around (it will eventually become 8th). The park is on your Left. <br>
Park on 8th,  there are places near the stoplight, or you can park in <br>
the neighborhood nearby.<br>
<br>
Follow the cement path to the large wooden bench  turn right.<br>
<br>
Into the Woods.<br>
<br>
Out of the Woods.<br>
<br>
Down the stairs.<br>
<br>
1/2 way between stair and fence, a sentinel looms to the right.<br>
<br>
Sneak behind the giant, as his brothers scratch and grab trying to <br>
prevent your passage.<br>
<br>
But for those that are loyal and brave, C lies in wait under bark <br>
and leaf.<br>
