The Splendid Buccaneers placed two more boxes today in the Zebediah <br/>
Gump story. They are:<br/>
<br/>
Z Gump - Mustang<br/>
Z Gump - Sixteen Ton<br/>
<br/>
I have to tell you how much fun I'm having researching all the boxes <br/>
we've placed. I've lived here for over 30 years and know basic bits <br/>
of history, but have learned so many wonderful and intersting facts <br/>
since I started doing this. <br/>
I spent a great morning at the local library this week reading a one <br/>
of a kind, hand-typed book about the history of Palisade. Aside from <br/>
the great facts I uncovered, I was highly entertained by the <br/>
editorial comments placed in the stories from the local paper that <br/>
would never be tolerated today! A great time. So, I wanted to thank <br/>
you all for getting me going... my brain is all filled with fun new <br/>
facts that my family patiently listens to. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Esmerelda, patiently waiting...if you plant it..they will come!<br/>

   Yes, that is eventually true. I have been doing a little happy <br/>
dance ever since I found splendid buccaneer stamps in some of my <br/>
boxes here in Durango. Now I just need to get that road trip <br/>
organized.<br/>

were doing their own happy dance! :)  They had a blast and I heard <br/>
all about it today.  After we placed our boxes today, we came back to <br/>
Aunt Esmerelda's for a carve-a-thon, so the next time you see their <br/>
stamps they'll be their own special creations. heheheh. <br/>
<br/>
Es, patiently carving away and watching her P number pass up her F <br/>
number <g><br/>
