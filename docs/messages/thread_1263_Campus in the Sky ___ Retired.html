I recieved a note last week that the maps were no longer under the <br/>
deer hoof for Campus in the Sky. I went and checked and found out <br/>
that whoever took the maps also used them to take the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox was into it's fourth year and contained some very dear <br/>
and valuable stamps to me. I don't really have the heart to start all <br/>
over on this particular box, so I'm going to retire it. The clues <br/>
took a long time to walk through and the stamp was nothing very <br/>
special so I think it is better just as a memory. Lion's Den is still <br/>
there and unless the theives figure out what cougar the bonus clue <br/>
sheet is talking about, it will live on with it's own published clue.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not as dejected as I sound, and I have an idea or two for some <br/>
new boxes around here. I just thought I should let you folks know in <br/>
case you have printed copies of that clue.<br/>
<br/>
Box On!<br/>

one and only bonus box.  I remember being SO EXCITED to discover it! <br/>
I'm really sorry to see it go, but have great memories of the find -<br/>
and am glad you are not as torn up about it as I am.8~)<br/>

Looking forward to the next one,<br/>

this box is gone and other boxers won't have the excitement we had <br/>
walking around campus looking for the next spot (we had unraveled the <br/>

understand retiring it, however, since it was so exposed and hard to be <br/>
sneaky with all those students around. Way fun to find though! Hats off <br/>
to a great box with lots of pizazz!<br/>
