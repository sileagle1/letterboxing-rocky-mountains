                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmmm.  I didn't pace of the distance, Eric did.  I know it was about even<br>
with the three big boulders and up the rock wall.  (I had to reach).  I'm<br>
not entirely sure where Funhog was looking, I think she was looking near the<br>
ground, rather than up high.<br>
<br>
Funhog lives in Oregon, and she was out here on business to plant Rain Cloud<br>
and Shining Star.  She got stuck on a layover a few weeks back, and was able<br>
to check on her two boxes, and spend some time looking for Litha, too.  I'm<br>
sorry she didn't locate it - I would love to have her stamp in my logbook.<br>
<br>
Anyway - I'll check on it soon - since I know Fiona and Joe would like to<br>
get up Dinosaur Ridge for both boxes (once Fiona's back is in better shape,<br>
poor thing) and I'll check to see how the clues and my original placement<br>
hold up!<br>

Best,<br>
