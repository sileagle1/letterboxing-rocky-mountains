&gt; 5/3/2009 - Box replanted. Carving the same but smaller with more detail.<br/>
&gt; Clues altered slightly. Make sure to print the clues for Nightmare Before<br/>
&gt; Christmas: Jack Skellington &amp; Sally:<br/>
&gt; http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=58407 They are alive and<br/>
&gt; well at Joplin Cemetery too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Special Notes: Joplin Cemetery is your destination. Pets are not allowed in<br/>
&gt; the cemetery. The cemetery is open 8:00 a.m. to sundown seven days a week.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Joplin Cemetery has a memorial to commemorate the cemetery. It reads: To<br/>
&gt; the memory of the pioneer families who came to this valley in 1880. This<br/>
&gt; sacred place is reserved and perpetuated just as they found it dry and<br/>
&gt; desolate. Many were the hardships and privations they endured. Dedicated to<br/>
&gt; the spirit of the old timers and pioneers.<br/>
&gt; Location: Joplin Cemetery located at 4700 East Chinden Boulevard, Meridian,<br/>
&gt; Idaho. Chinden Boulevard &amp; Joplin Road.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Clues: Enter the cemetery from Joplin Road through the chain link fence.<br/>
&gt; Take the paved path to the very northwest corner of the cemetery  section H<br/>
&gt; near plots 183-186. Locate Fay N. Beberness who lived from June 29, 1914 to<br/>
&gt; March 12, 1999. Directly behind Fay is a large round pine tree. Hidden in<br/>
&gt; the base of the tree as it splits into many smaller sections on the left<br/>
&gt; hand side camouflages by two very thin rocks and a couple of twigs you will<br/>
&gt; find this angel hiding. Please place the box and rocks back securely as they<br/>
&gt; are the key to keeping the box hidden from muggles.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Should you note the box missing, its contents in bad repair or if you just<br/>
&gt; want to say "Hi" please contact me at Blackvelvetrav@yahoo.com<blackvelvetrav%40yahoo.com>.<br/>
&gt; Thank you &amp; happy hunting!<br/>
