When Fuelracer passed away, I took over maintainence of his boxes in UT.<br>
I visited one today that I hadn't found before in Tooele County.  Turns<br>
out it needs a new container.  It will be a while before I get out there<br>
again, so if any UT boxers intend to visit Fanfueler, would you please<br>
take a Lock & Lock or Rubbermaid big enough to hold a 4x5 inch log book?<br>
The stamp is in a pill bottle, but if it doesn't fit in the box, a<br>
ziploc bag will do nicely.<br>
<br>
Also reprint your clues before going to Fanfueler because I moved it<br>
slightly for better cover.<br>
<br>
Thanks!    BL47<br>

The log book has gotten wet, as well, although it is dry now and still<br>
usable.  I will get another one out there when I can.<br>
