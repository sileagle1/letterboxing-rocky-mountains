Kat!  Pirates can go anywhere they want!  That's one of the cool <br>
things about being one!  They put up signs saying, 'no pirates <br>
allowed' and you just sail right in anyway singing a sea ditty <br>
because you're a pirate and you just scoff at signs like that!  But <br>
we always use good manners when we do it. <br>

Boxer Lover.. I promise the flight attendants will vote me their <br>
favorite passenger of the day!  I'll be keeping all the people around <br>
me from hitting their call buttons or putting trash in the seat <br>
pockets.  I'll call the flight attendants by name, say 'please' <br>
and 'thank you' and tell them what a great job they did when we're <br>
deplaning.  <br>

I'll let you all know about the pie situation.  I'm on it.  <br>
