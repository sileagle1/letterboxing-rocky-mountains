<br>
How many is too many in one area?  I'd like to do several here where <br>
I live, Palisade, but it is a VERY small town. Sort of like Mayberry. <br>
Is there a saturation point that takes the fun out of it for <br>
searchers?  If you could find, say, 3 or 4 boxes in a couple of hours <br>
would that be too many?<br>
<br>
All the boxes I've done are historical and have something to do with <br>
where they are planted. All the stamps are handcarved and all the <br>
journals handmade. They all have first finder stuff. So I'm not <br>
trying to pump out quantity versus quality.  But is there some kind <br>
of guideline for how far apart they should be to keep them <br>
interesting?<br>

     I guess my opinion on the density has to do with the style of <br>
the boxes. Some places just cry out for letterboxes. Other locations <br>
are more random and just happen to be a hiding place that the clues <br>
lead to. I have placed boxes of both types. I guess I am saying that <br>
it can get to be contrived if there are a lot of the second type of <br>
box within a 15 minute drive of the placer's house. From what I have <br>
seen of your clues, Esmerelda, they sound like pretty special spots, <br>
and they definitely aren't all in downtown Palisade. I hope this <br>
rambling makes some sense. And I guess the short version is- place <br>
them and let the seeker decide what is right for them.<br>
<br>
     Also, for some perspective, a newbie in CT just started a couple <br>
of weeks ago and has just surpassed F 100. There's some density for <br>
ya. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks... that helps a lot.  I haven't had the opportunity to find <br>
enough boxes to make me feel like I know what's good and bad. If that <br>
makes any sense. <br>
<br>
I would like to do 3 in Palisade and was concerned that might be <br>
overdoing it. <br>
<br>
I haven't done any 'general' boxes yet, but I'm sure I'll end up with <br>
some sometime. Probably sooner than later.  I promise not to put 300 <br>
of them in a square mile, though! :::laughs:::<br>
<br>
At this point I can't imagine being F100!  Your Grand Valley Box is <br>
the only one within hours and hours of us! (and we thank you and hope <br>
you bring more next time you visit.. hehehehe).  I was able to find a <br>
few in Denver when we placed the Parker boxes, and also some in <br>
Oregon.  But even so, I'm just F13.  It's not just about the numbers <br>
for me, but, on the other hand, the numbers indicate how many times I <br>
get to go on an adventure to find a box. So, I guess it *is* about <br>
the numbers in a way, eh?<br>
<br>
We're working on one for Durango. We figure you gave us one, we <br>
better return the favor. :)<br>
<br>
Thanks to both of you for your answers.. I appreciate it. <br>

 Hey, for the record I am at F12 P7. I am very lucky to have had some <br>
pretty famous letterboxers leave some in SW Colorado and SE Utah, but <br>
there are no other local boxers that I am aware of. I am at the point <br>
where it will take a multi-day road trip to get some boxes that I <br>
haven't stamped. <br>
<br>
   I couldn't believe there were no boxes around Grand Junction when <br>
I started. And still only one in Steamboat; none in the San Luis <br>
Valley. But it wasn't that long ago when that was the case for Denver <br>
and Colorado Springs. Things are changing and the boxes we are <br>
planting now will be the "dear old" boxes when a few more people are <br>
involved. It is pretty cool, actually.<br>
