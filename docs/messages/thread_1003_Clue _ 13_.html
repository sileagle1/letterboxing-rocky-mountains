                    <div class="plaintext-content">y - Looking back over the clues, I seem to be missing #13.  Do you <br>
have that one?<br>
<br>
A lot of these clues do seem to fit some kind of golf theme:<br>
<br>
6. Bayfield zip plus 1679. (Sheridan Hall behind the golf course)<br>
11. In a roundabout way Big 5 Sports and Gardenschwartz could lead <br>
you there. ("round" could refer to the frisbee, or is there <br>
a "roundabout" - traffic circle nearby?)<br>
12. You won't find it at the snowshoe shuffle.  (Snowshoe Shuffle <br>
for Snowdown was to be held at the Hillcrest Golf Course, which <br>
seems fairly near the frisbee golf course)<br>
14. Beware of the Cobras and Sharks (again, Cobra clubs and Shark <br>
gear - beware of the golfers - maybe it's near a boundary between <br>
the disc golf course and regular Hillcrest course?)<br>
15. It's like Tiger in the woods. (disc golf course again)<br>
<br>
These clues may indicate where on the disc course it is, but not <br>
being a local, many don't make sense to me:<br>
5. The Frosty Difference (Still don't know this one.)<br>
7. Hop right above it. (???)<br>
8. Walk in the direction that the walking man just came from. (Is <br>
there a ped crossing sign somewhere near either the disc golf course <br>
of the Hillcrest golf course, maybe at a golf-cart crossing?)<br>
10. Turn at the light just before the river, park at the third light <br>
after that. (???)<br>
16. No Motorcycles, No Parking, No Camping.  (Is there a sign that <br>
says this somewhere near the woods or courses?)<br>
17. A woodpecker may point the way. (???)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, that's what I'm saying, sorry to be unclear - a lot of clues lead <br>
you to golf, but then this one says it's NOT at Hillcrest, but there <br>
is a nearby frisbee golf course, behind Sheridan hall, which seems to <br>
confirm y's suspicion it is at the frisbee golf course.  The clue <br>
about beware of golfers (cobras & sharks) leads me to believe it may <br>
be NEAR the regular golf course, but not on it, so I was wondering if <br>
these two areas border each other.<br>
<br>
No posts from y... he must be out hunting around...<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, that was exactly it. The two courses are near each other and that <br>
clue was to point us toward the disc golf course.<br>
<br>
Also JeLy bean was right about the fact that a Roundabout is planned <br>
for the intersection between the two courses. And that Big 5 and <br>
Gardenschwartz are the two places where you can buy golf discs in <br>
town. Pretty good clue writing for a DJ I think....he would be a good <br>
letterboxer.<br>
