BTW, since the image map for the state of colorado is still messed up <br/>
at LbNA, you have to click in the lower left part of the state to get <br/>
to some of the central area clues. Looks like they reworked how they <br/>
grouped the counties but forgot to update the image map. Anyone know <br/>
if Wes is aware of this?<br/>

Yes, Wes let me know recently that map problems are different than <br/>
simple navigational problems. He has to shut down the whole map part <br/>
of the site to work on those. Therefore, he is saving up a list of <br/>
things to do when he shuts down the site. Sounds like it might be a <br/>
while, but he is aware of the problem.<br/>
