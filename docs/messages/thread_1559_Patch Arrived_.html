Wow! I am so amazed by the patch, it is gorgeous!<br>
In fact, my current letterboxing bag is not worthy enough to sew the patch onto... I need to get a new backpack now :-)<br>
<br>
Thanks again for all you brilliant designing and work!<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
