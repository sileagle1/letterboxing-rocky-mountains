Yeah, I guess the finders, TaiChi and ChaiTea, were circling the area <br>
when a Ranger asked them if they were looking for a letterbox. I <br>
guess they needed some rocks to shore up some erosion and the Onion <br>
is now soup.<br>
<br>
On a happier note, my boys and I found Kokopelli of the Ruins today  <br>
and had a great time checking out an awesome kiva that I didn't know <br>
was there. Another great day because of letterboxing.<br>
