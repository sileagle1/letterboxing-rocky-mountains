running out of room for photos on RMLetterboxing.  Those of you who have<br>
uploaded photos should delete the full size versions of your images, if<br>
you haven't done so.  This would free up space for more photos.  What you<br>
do is ... go into your album, click on the photo, click on full size<br>
version and then hit "delete full size version only," and then hit the<br>
confirmation when it comes up.  It's simple enough and we might add a few<br>
more photos when there is more room available.<br>

I went through and deleted the full size images on all of the photo <br>
albums. I hope this doesn't upset anybody, but I think we all want <br>
to see as many photos as we can without deleting any of the older <br>
ones. With the full sizes gone we are using less than 10 percent of <br>
our capacity. <br>
<br>
If anyone wants the high resolution copies, I'm sure the photo <br>
takers can send you a copy.<br>

I added some more photos and think there will be a couple more that I'll<br>
add tonight.  Some got downloaded to Yoque's computer and I don't have<br>
access at the moment.<br>
