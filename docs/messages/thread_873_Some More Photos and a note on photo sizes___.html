you haven't done so.  This would free up space for more photos.  What you<br/>
do is ... go into your album, click on the photo, click on full size<br/>
version and then hit "delete full size version only," and then hit the<br/>

I went through and deleted the full size images on all of the photo <br/>
albums. I hope this doesn't upset anybody, but I think we all want <br/>
to see as many photos as we can without deleting any of the older <br/>
ones. With the full sizes gone we are using less than 10 percent of <br/>
our capacity. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants the high resolution copies, I'm sure the photo <br/>
takers can send you a copy.<br/>
<br/>
Box On!<br/>

I added some more photos and think there will be a couple more that I'll<br/>
add tonight.  Some got downloaded to Yoque's computer and I don't have<br/>
access at the moment.<br/>
