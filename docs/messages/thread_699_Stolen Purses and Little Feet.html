exactly what a pain it is.  Good advice to boxers out there.  Stow your <br/>
valuables in your trunk.   If they cant see it, they wont break in.  Bummer <br/>
.....<br/>
<br/>
I haven't had any news that Little Feet is missing.  It's a microbox, so are <br/>
you sure you had the right location?  When we were there, we had trouble <br/>
finding it - so we waited until the coast was clear, and one of my party <br/>
literally laid on the ground to find the film cannister.  He nearly missed <br/>
it.  Was this your first attempt at it??<br/>
Anyone in the Springs want to double check this one, and let A-Bear know??<br/>
<br/>
:( on both accounts.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

&gt; For those interested - the Lamb has a new home and the clues are<br/>
&gt; posted.  Also, last Saturday, I went to the Rock to check on my LB<br/>
&gt; there and while hiking, got my window smashed and my purse stolen from<br/>
&gt; my car.  We all know better than to leave our purses under the front<br/>
&gt; seat of the car, so please remember this good advice.  This has been a<br/>
&gt; real pain.    Puppypaws in pain<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; A friend came in to town over this past weekend &amp; we met up at GofG for<br/>
&gt; Little Feet. It is my sad duty to report that Little Feet is missing. Does<br/>
&gt; anyone know if the box was pulled? I know that GofG doesn't allow Geocache<br/>
&gt; or Letterboxes, so perhaps that is why? <br/>
