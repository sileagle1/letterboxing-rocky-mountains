<br/>
Santa Fe Letterboxers are hosting a Dinner Mini Meet on Saturday, <br/>
November 11th at 6:00 pm. The Meet will be at a local restaurant <br/>
specializing in New Mexican cuisine.<br/>
<br/>
Maria's New Mexican Kitchen<br/>
555 W Cordova Rd<br/>
Santa Fe, NM<br/>
<br/>
We are planning for a very casual dinner event, with plenty of time <br/>
for exchanges, story telling and sharing of ideas. We hope this is <br/>
an opportunity to meet letterboxers from surrounding areas. No <br/>
structured events are planned, although there are plenty of boxes in <br/>
the nearby area to keep you busy for a few days.<br/>
<br/>
We hope to see you there!<br/>
<br/>
The event has been posted on Atlas Quest. Please sign up if you plan <br/>
to attend. We need to know how many people will be there so we can <br/>
make reservations.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
lionsmane63 and Astro D<br/>

<br/>
  We would love to have you if you can juggle it. I don't need to know until a few days before - so you have a little time.<br/>
<br/>
  By the way - thanks for the paper stuff. It is great. It will come in handy. I am going through buttons now - I only have a few that fit your rings. I have one more jar to go through and then I'll send them to you.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks again!<br/>
  Mark<br/>
