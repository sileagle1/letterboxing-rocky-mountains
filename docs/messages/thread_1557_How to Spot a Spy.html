world.  They have false identities.  They deal with codes, ciphers and <br/>
methods of concealment.  They are seeking a kind of treasure.  They are <br/>
trying to learn something most people don't know.  So, how could you <br/>
tell if someone you know is only a letterboxer, or a real KGB spy?<br/>

I have come up with a patented failsafe JeLyBean method for spotting a <br/>
spy.  Here's how it works.  You walk up to someone who is seemingly <br/>
only a letterboxer and say some improbable phrase.  I recommend, "It is <br/>
lovely this time of year in Minsk."  If the person looks at you like <br/>
your medication has worn off, they are probably just a plain <br/>
letterboxer.  But, if they reply with an equally improbable phrase and <br/>
hand you a strange object, they are probably a KGB spy.  Brilliant, huh?<br/>
