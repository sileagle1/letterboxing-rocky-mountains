Gathering! It truly was GRAND!  Grand weather, grand location, grand <br/>
food...think peach pie...JeLy, think PEACH PIE!, and grand <br/>
letterboxers and GRAND stamping!  <br/>
<br/>
Aljan and Silent Wings did some GRAND carving on the Event stamps!  <br/>
Talk about COOL!  Well, check out my photos, they speak for <br/>
themselves!  <br/>
<br/>
It was GRAND to see boxers we've known for awhile and to meet new <br/>
ones!  Eoghan, Autumn and I were talking about the 1st gathering and <br/>
how much fun that was....we miss you and Pumpkin Princess!  Start <br/>
reading this site more than once a month...I'm STILL trying to <br/>
pronounce your name with the correct pronunciation!  We need you <br/>
there to explain it AND, THE MEANING OF LIFE (sorry, but, I loved <br/>
that box!).<br/>
<br/>
Okay, must go...must check out the new Bronco team....I will post <br/>
more later!  <br/>
<br/>
We missed you all that weren't able to make it, and ate pie in your <br/>
behalf!<br/>

faces is fun to see. The pictures of stamps show some absolutely <br/>
beautiful carving from everyone! It is fun to see faces I met last <br/>
year, and faces to be put with names! However, I don't believe I saw <br/>
any pie, eh?<br/>

a few things quickly...<br/>
<br/>
First, Aljan &amp; Clan, thanks for everything!  Especially for the <br/>
moose.<br/>
<br/>
Second, thanks for all the great stamps everyone; our journal is <br/>
positively swelling.<br/>
<br/>
Third, we asked at Jenny's on our way home whether anyone had <br/>
stopped in for the Yes! letterbox and we were told that five or six <br/>
had stopped in over the weekend.  A few minutes later, two kids came <br/>
in from the other room to take the cracker tin down.  They weren't <br/>
anyone who had been at the gathering, though.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we ended up bumping into Rubber Peace and her hubby on <br/>
Saturday evening and again on Sunday morning at two different <br/>
boxes.  Tomorrow I will post a picture of our two cars parked <br/>
together near the Rafter Laughter box.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure I have forgotten quite a bit of what I wanted to write, but <br/>
I will add more tomorrow when I am not so tired (we also picked up <br/>
Happy Dance in Fraser - whew!).<br/>

It was a lovely time of fishing, raspberry eating and stamping.  Thus, we<br/>
were up on Trail Ridge for the sunset last night, which was a grand way<br/>
to end a grand weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the Aljan family for everything!  Thank you Boxer Lover for<br/>
bringing the sun.  The weather held out ALMOST to the very end of the<br/>
gathering!  Special thanks to FRH and Preboxed for planting four lovely<br/>
new boxes in Aljan territory.  We enjoyed all the traveling boxes,<br/>
travelers and sig trades.  Cooties also made some appearances at this<br/>
Grand event.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Dixie, I can't take credit for the Osprey postage stamp ... that<br/>
was Yoque's work.  I'll try to get some other photos posted in the next<br/>
couple of days.<br/>

and making new friends, too. Many, many thanks to Aljan and Silent<br/>
Wings for all your efforts! Even the weather held up for the most<br/>
part. Thanks, too, to Preboxed and Front Range Hiker for adding new<br/>
boxes for our enjoyment. Great photos, Peach! I'll be adding some near<br/>
the end of the week. I'll try for an accurate caption for the group<br/>
shot, but no guarantees! We also kept running into Rubberpeace and rbr<br/>
horno at letterboxes. Loved the fun, food, pie, 'boxing, MOOSE,<br/>
exploring, stamping, dodging rain drops, shopping, library, new towns,<br/>
personal travelers, scenery, history, conversation, hiking - all of<br/>
it! Can hardly wait for next time! I neglected to get the Dread Peach<br/>
stamp and Captain Scapula, so Peach and JerseyBoy, bring those again<br/>
next time - please.<br/>
