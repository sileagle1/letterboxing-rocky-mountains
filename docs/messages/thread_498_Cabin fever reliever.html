Hello folks-<br>
    My little town is having it's annual winter festival called <br>
Snowdown. As part of the festivities we have the "Search for the <br>
Silver Bullet" which is a treasure hunt put on by the local radio <br>
station and the Coors Plant. They give out five clues a day over the <br>
radio, spaced three hours apart, and recap all previous clues with <br>
the evening clue. This lasts for five days. The clues lead to some <br>
treasure that you turn in for $250 cash plus other prizes which makes <br>
this thing hugely popular.<br>
<br>
     Two years ago the clues were hard, but not hard enough, and <br>
someone found it on the third day. This loses a lot of advertising <br>
potential so last year they made the clues ridiculously hard and on <br>
the sixth day they announced the 26th clue which was it's exact <br>
location. Pandemonium ensued as hundreds of people raced for The <br>
Bullet. I just got the first five clues today for this years' hunt. I <br>
should say that I've never even come close to ever finding it. But I <br>
have considered offering my services as clue writer.<br>
<br>
     Anyway, it's a LOT of fun and maybe I'll crack it early enough <br>
this year. Who knows?<br>

What a hoot!!  I'll be thinking good pirate thoughts for you to zoom <br>
in and grab it!<br>
<br>
Es, thinking about how much carving stuff you could buy with $250<br>
