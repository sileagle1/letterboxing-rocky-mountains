                    <div class="plaintext-content">Turns out it was Beltane.  Apparently there was a note inside saying <br>
it had been floating in the water!  *blinks*  It's not even that <br>
close to the water!  Alas!<br>
<br>
But the finder said he would re-hide it, and I sent him the clues to <br>
Ostara as well, so maybe we'll have another new boxes among us!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile - consider Beltane down for maintenance until further <br>
notice.  Clues were updated to reflect the same.  <br>
Thanks all,<br>
