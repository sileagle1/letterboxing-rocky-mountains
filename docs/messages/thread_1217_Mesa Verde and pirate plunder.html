                    <div class="plaintext-content">And RIGHT before the snow.. that makes it an even better adventure.  I <br>
hope you took along some good snacks. When springtime rolls around I'm <br>
gonna have to sail back over there to grab all the new boxes I've <br>
missed.  <br>
<br>
I finally got down to the river to find CWSunseeker's new box.  I was <br>
waiting til my niece and nephews arrived and we all went off on an <br>
adventure.  I gave them the clues and the compass and they tracked it <br>
down.  When they found the awesome stamp they liked it so much they <br>
stamped it all over their hands (ala Stupender Man!).  Now, these kids <br>
are 19, 16 and 14!  We also scored an excellent hitchhiker and <br>
stumbled onto some geocachers a stone's throw away.  The 19 year old <br>
thought it was such a kick that he carved a stamp that night and will <br>
be seeking out boxes in the Greeley and Ft. Collins area soon.  Is <br>
this a great hobby or what?!<br>
<br>
Es, who thinks this is a great hobby<br>

LET IT SNOW, LET IT SNOW, LET IT SNOW!  Wow, is this snow beautiful or <br>
what!?!  I've had to do some pretty hefty shoveling (we got 12-15 <br>
inches here), but, I can't complain when those beautiful huge white <br>
flakes fall all around me!  Lovin' it!  And then of course, sitting by <br>
the fire and dreamin' of special treaures buried under lots of white <br>
stuff...havin' to wait until Spring to uncover them...well, it just <br>
gives you something to look forward to in 2007!  But, then again, we <br>
live in Colorado, and we have done boxing all year round, so, what am I <br>
sayin'!!!  Gadszooks, we need to get out there and hunt...forget the <br>
yulelog! <br>
<br>
Hot chocolate anyone???<br>
