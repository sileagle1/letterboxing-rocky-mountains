One thing to consider is contacting Lock Wench over on AQ. She did a <br>
whole research project based on not liking what was currently available <br>
in 'boxing patch land, then had a bunch done up.<br>
<br>
<br>
You can see samples and contact info on her AQ profile.  Although I <br>
don't know her personally, I've certainly seen her around enough on AQ <br>
that I would feel quite comfortable sending her a note to ask about her <br>
vendor if you shouldn't happen to feel comfortable doing so.  I can't <br>
say for sure, but I have this feeling she did everything by mail, not <br>
locally.  (New England)  I do know she was extremely pleased with the <br>
quality of what she got.<br>

Their quote is a little under $3.00 a piece, that's for 200 patches.  <br>
Decent, but I am going to do some shopping around too.  Anybody know a <br>

I'd don't know much about patch prices, but, I'd be happy to pay <br>
$3.00 each and would buy several.  Should you need to purchase a <br>
minimum, I would be happy to join in your endeavors and invest in the <br>
initial run of 200 until all can be sold.  Aljan, you've taken the <br>
lead on this and you're doing a great job.  You tell us what you need <br>
and you already know that you have a bunch of rag tag mateys to lend <br>
a hand, however you see fit!  Just you hollar, Captain of the <br>
patches!!!<br>

You might try Creative Hands Emporium in Lafayette, near the scout<br>
office.  Dunno if you'll get a better price quote, but it is a local<br>
company that did a patrol patch for my son's troop ("double quarter<br>
pounder with cheese" - guess they were hungry when they picked their<br>
patrol name).  We started with "blanks" that were purchased from the<br>
scout office...might be another way to reduce costs, but probably not<br>
for a large order.<br>

project and coordinating everything. And the patch design - wow! That's <br>
all I got - W-O-W! You know you have a ton of helping hands if and when <br>
you may need them. We would also snag perhaps half a dozen on the first <br>

I'll update the database. Thanks to Autumn, our fearless moderator, for <br>
