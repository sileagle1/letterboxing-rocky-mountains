started carving.  We are in the process of remodeling our kitchen, so I<br/>
spend most of the day trying to entertain the kids or get them out of<br/>
the house so they don't bother the workers.  This means absolutely NO me<br/>
time till 3pm when they nap.<br/>
<br/>
I too plan to plant these boxes when they return home.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I have a question... hmmm, I think I will post it in another email<br/>
as I want everyone to read it and reply - hopefully no one yells at me!<br/>

Which one can't you do with the kids? :::tries to think of it:::<br/>
<br/>
I had to run out and get my journal to count. I am F30 HH1 (I didn't <br/>
count the two I found that didn't have stamps) and P...umm...16 I <br/>
think. I have one almost ready to go to the Monster Mash that I'll <br/>
place in Colorado when it returns, and a hitchhiker that will get <br/>
shoosted off soon. Also a mystery box that I can hopefully place in <br/>
the next week or so. I'm looking forward to getting the monster mash <br/>
one back and seeing the journal full of east coast stamps!  I bet I <br/>
won't get a Scotland, though!!<br/>
<br/>
I've been covering the state because that's the only way for me to <br/>
find any boxes! :D  And it's fun for me to take some along to place <br/>
as we go.  I really enjoy making them. <br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Out of curiosity what is your placed vs find count?  (mine placed is<br/>

&gt; We managed to plant a few as we zoomed around the mountains last <br/>
&gt; weekend. They are:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wings of Eagles<br/>
&gt; Olga Little<br/>
&gt; Denver Rio Grande<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I forgot to say in my report that we picked up the Happy Birthday <br/>
HH <br/>
&gt; at one of the boxes and will send it on it's way soon!<br/>
