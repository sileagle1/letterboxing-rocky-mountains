Boxer/Pie Lover!<br>
<br>
No comparing silver hairs... mine have somehow 'vanished'.  I'll be <br>
one of those 127 year old ladies playing bingo with elegantly coiffed <br>
pink hair.  Woot!!  <br>
<br>
If you're still searching for the location, the ren faire is between <br>
Colorado Springs and Denver in a very small town called 'Larkspur'.  <br>
It's basically a grocery/gas store.. and a renaissance village.  My <br>
favorite kind.  If you type Colorado Renaissance Festival into <br>
google, it'll pop up the page and it has maps.  I'd do a link but I'm <br>
at work and it won't let me open a second window.  I'm being <br>
repressed. <br>
<br>
Because of my schedule (yes, back to that again) I won't know a date <br>
for sure until the month before.  And, yes, the faire is certainly <br>
farther from Idaho than Fort Collins is!  I would completely <br>
understand it if y'all want to meet there instead.  I, myself, will <br>
still be going to the faire since, well, that's what pirates do. <br>
hehehe.  A year just isn't a year until I have my day at the faire. :)<br>
<br>
You're so kind about the stamp and box.  I'm so lucky and grateful to <br>
be involved with such a fun group of boxers!<br>
<br>
Es, deep in the bowels of DIA and pining for the open sea<br>
