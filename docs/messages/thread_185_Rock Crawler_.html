Ha!  I won't tell you how I REALLY felt about Rock Crawler - heh, <br>
heh, heh!  No kidding, it's amazing that this microbox is still <br>
there.  A ranger with a group of about 10 people were a few steps <br>
from the location!  And that's close!  I can't believe the ranger <br>
didn't spot it because he was squatting as to point something out to <br>
the group!  Once again, awesome carving efforts!  <br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
