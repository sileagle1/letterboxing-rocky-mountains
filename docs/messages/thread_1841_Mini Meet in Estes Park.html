                    <html><body><div>Breakfast and Boxing anyone? </div><div></div><div>Sarcasmo is coming to town, and what a wonderful excuse to drive up to the beautiful Estes Park!  We'll meet for breakfast and exchanges at 9am at Molly B Restaurant <a href="http://www.estesparkmollyb.com/" target="_blank">http://www.estesparkmollyb.com/</a> (you can view their menu online here) - and then everyone can go letterboxing (this way folks can box as long as they are able).  There are MANY beautiful letterboxes in Estes Park - and we're right at the entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park - so yeah ... can you think of anything better for a Monday morning?    Mondays typically suck, so let's make this one awesome!!<br/>
<br/>I know ... I know ... many of you will have to work.  Consider going in late!  Tell your boss you have ... um ... sarcasmo-itis, and it can only be cured with breakfast and boxing!   or letterboxing and lunch??? C'mon ... you know you want to!!!<br/>
<br/>(okay - I'm setting this up now, but I'm technically waiting on confirmation from our visiting guest of honor - stay tuned!)</div><div></div><div>Here is the link to the AQ event. I hope a few folks can come! And I want to do a little boxing in EP!!!</div>
