I've been participating in the Race for the Cure for several years now since a colleague of mine was first diagnosed with breast cancer.  This past year, of course, two of our letterboxing friends have also battled breast cancer.  In recognition of this, I decided to create a special team for this year's race called "Stamp out Cancer!":<br>

<br>
This year's race is October 3.  I hope that some of you will be able to join me at the Race for the Cure.  Since three miles *is* a long way to walk without the prospect of a stamp, I'd be open to the idea of a post-race mini-meet if anyone else is game.<br>
