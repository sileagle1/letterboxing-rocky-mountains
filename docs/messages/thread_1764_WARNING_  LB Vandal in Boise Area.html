Yeah, I agree with the recommendation to list your boxes as "word of mouth clues" - you can do that on AQ, and just list it that way on LBNA, too.  That way, you can give out the clues slowly to someone you dont know and check the boxes between visitors.  <br/>
<br/>
What rotten news!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for the support of my locally murdered letterboxes. I have completed my investigation tonight and have posted my conclusions on my LB blog: http://lbwithblackvelvetrav.blogspot.com<br/>
<br/>
I did check two other boxes that are mere blocks from these two and they were still alive and well. But it makes you wonder how long it will be before this person strikes again and/or if they have already and I am unaware of which ones have been targeted. It makes your mind race!!!<br/>
<br/>
WOM boxes migth be a lot of work but if more are murdered I may not have a choice.  What a pain in my pa-tootie! And worst of all is they took my good carvings that were new. At least if they are going to murder my boxes they could pick the old ones with my carvings that sucked!<br/>
