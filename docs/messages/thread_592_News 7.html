I have mixed emotions about putting this on TV because many of the <br>
rangers are already thinking tons of LB's tramp all over the <br>
environment and destroy stuff. This is the problem we have been <br>
running into here in our area when we want to put out a box and this <br>
is why they want to limit us in Jefferson County and now other <br>

I agree with what you say but I think this is a perfect opportunity to state<br>
our case and why we are a benefit to the parks and there future rather than<br>
a problem.  Think about the opportunity we have to positively effect<br>
letterboxing!  As long as we watch our "step" and what we say, we could come<br>

out on a hike and shows them a box, we can feel comfortable that they <br>

You wrote earlier that Mitch "does understand that we are not going to<br>
give too much away and put letterboxing or our plants in jeopardy."<br>
Are you going to demonstrate the process by taking him to a letterbox?<br>
In order to protect existing plants, would it be a good idea to plant<br>
a temporary box just for that purpose? Perhaps you have a retired<br>
stamp with log book that you could write a new set of clues for, for<br>
just the interview. Or someone there in your area might have one to<br>
use. If the hike is this Saturday, you don't have much time to put a<br>
new one together. Just a thought.......<br>

Personally, as one of those who have had a box disappear, I would like <br>
Mitch to know that is one of the reasons that we are leery of too much <br>
publicity.  We like to get people genuinely interested involved, but <br>
we also fear the exposure to a few bad apples.  We're not elitists but <br>
we hold ourselves to a high standard and want to make sure that is <br>
respected.<br>
<br>
Maybe in addition to concerns, we can add why we are each so <br>
interested in this hobby and pass that information along to Mitch as <br>
well.<br>

Well put!  I have been in contact with Mitch and we are planning to hit the<br>

I think it was also mentioned previously when a reporter wanted to do <br>
a story on letterboxing that they will keep looking until they find <br>
someone willing to talk.  Isn't it better that this group is in <br>
control of what information is going out rather than Joe Schmo who <br>
isn't as respectful or knowledgable?<br>
<br>
Maybe for those who will be talking to 7News, the rest of us can <br>
contribute via this board, each indicating what we think is most <br>
important to be covered in the story.  Then, if someone takes 7News <br>
out on a hike and shows them a box, we can feel comfortable that they <br>
will continually hear about the importance of respecting property, <br>
whether it be parkland or the boxes themselves, and whatever other <br>
important points we can come up with amongst ourselves.<br>

Here's why I like letterboxing. I like the "hunt." I like being in on<br>
the "secret." I like hiking in our beautiful mountains, along our<br>
refreshing rivers and through our awe-inspiring canyons. Letterboxing<br>
provides me with an additional purpose for that exploration. It (and<br>
geocaching) take me places I would never have thought of investigating<br>
without the impetus it provides. <br>
<br>
At the other end of the spectrum, letterboxing also includes the<br>
opportunity to implement my creativity and artistry in a very unique<br>
manner by planning and contructing stamps, log books and boxes, and<br>
writing stories and clues. I enjoy some of the ancillary aspects of<br>
the hobby, like hitchhikers, travelers, and postal letterboxing. I<br>
like the liberating facets of the game that are limited only by our<br>
collective imaginations.<br>
<br>
I have met - online - many boxers who are supportive, positive, and<br>
downright hilarious. Letterboxing allows the possibility of having<br>
friends to whatever degree satisfies me. I could never actually meet<br>
any of these people face-to-face and thereby preserve my anonymity. Or<br>
I could choose to attend gatherings, learn to match faces to trail<br>
names, and build on those relationships. <br>
<br>
Letterboxing provides me with both physical and mental expression,<br>
both left- and right-brain exercise. And mostly it is just a whole lot<br>
of fun!<br>

Well said!  That about covers it all.  The only thing I'd add is <br>
that in addition to exploring places and trails I might never have <br>

Boxer Lover: You're eloquence speaks volumes for us all! You summed <br>
up every reason I have for boxing in your lovely statement! I love <br>
the hunt! I love having something to hike to. I love seeing these <br>
beautiful hikes (and stamps!!) that people have gone out of their <br>
way to research and share with me!<br>
<br>
I had to move the Alchemist's Lizard from its spot because the <br>
people who owned the land didn't want it there. When we got the <br>
logbook back, we were so disappointed it had to be moved! People <br>
from all over the country commented on the wonderful hike, and the <br>
wildlife they saw and how pretty the park was. Now that I have to <br>
put the box somewhere else, other people will miss out on that <br>
experience, and the park will miss out on having all of these people <br>
come to visit. I think if it is done right (and we try to be soooo <br>
careful to place a box the right way) then it can be beneficial to <br>
everyone!<br>
<br>
Ramdelt - thank you for being our representative in this matter!<br>
<br>
See you all in Moab!<br>
