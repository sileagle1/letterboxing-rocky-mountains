Here is the final count for Eagle, Idaho<br>
<br>
  30 Boxes Planted Originally<br>

  9 are Alive and Well<br>
  16 Were Taken and/or Vandalized within the last 3 months<br>
<br>
<br>
These are the boxes that are still alive and well in Eagle: <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am so sorry to hear this and it makes me worry that the same thing might happen elsewhere.  Based on the boxes that were taken or vandalized vs. the boxes left alone, can you draw any conclusions as to why only certain ones were targeted?  Were they the easiest to find or all near each other?  I guess I'm hoping it is a local problem and the vandal is too lazy to go far.<br>
<br>
Instead of pulling clues off the websites, you could leave the box descriptions with a note saying clues can be obtained with an email.  This would at least let people know they boxes are still available.  Also, if you get an email request and a box gets vandalized, you might have your culprit.  Just a thought.<br>

I do appreciate the time you have taken to check on your Eagle boxes so<br>
that the rest of us will know which ones to pursue when we are up there.<br>
You have always  been a conscientious boxer and I see that hasn't<br>
changed.  I don't have plans soon to visit your area, but when I do, I<br>
trust I can get the clues from you directly?<br>
<br>
Hoping the destruction is over!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you so much for everyone's on-line hug's, good juju and unique vandal stopping ideas.  As you can imagine Capperpillar and I have been on the vandals trail.  We even received some hot IT information from Ryan including IP addresses and the bogus profiles of our young vandals.  One of the IP addresses is located at a local high school.  Let's just say we have already been in touch with the schools IT department and the principal.  We take our missing and vandalized boxes very seriously!<br>
<br>
Although I have pulled my clues off of both LBNA and Atlas Quest there is a note on each page that I will share my clues with known boxers and/or ask for references of individuals I do not know (from boxers that may have introduced them to boxing).  What was very interesting is not very long after I did that I received two requests from individuals who said they were new to boxing (learned it from friends and relatives in another state) and wanted to know if they could have my clues or how they could get in my good graces.  I offered to meet in person with both people to show them the ropes and/or provide them with the clues to one box so I could ensure that they were taking proper care as new boxers before providing them with more clues.  As soon as I offered that to both I never heard back from either.  Seems a little fishy if you ask me.<br>
<br>
I am going to get my blog updated again tonight (I am boxing daily now so updates are VERY frequent) and today I checked on 5 Boise Boxes.  Three of the Five were vandalized.  I will post more pictures of the vandalized logbooks on my Blog.  Heavy sigh.  I really won't know which are alive and which are not until I check every last one of them.  The Capperpillar clan has been great trying to check on some of my boxes for me too.  They located one today that had been moved slightly that I could not locate so that was a wonderful surprise.  <br>
<br>
But no fear for the boxers we know and love.  I am mentally planning new boxes (instead of trying to replace all of these) that will be worth the Boise visit to find.  My carving skills have greatly improved, I am dreaming up new log books and even more challenging clues.  So all of this will eventually be just a bad memory as I will put out the welcome mat and wait for you all to come and visit.  The vandals will never get the best of us Boise boxers.  I think I have about 25 more to check in Boise.  It looks like my evenings will be spent boxing after work.  <br>
<br>
Thanks again for all the support!  Blackvelvetrav, Lizman & The Pei's of Adventure  <br>
