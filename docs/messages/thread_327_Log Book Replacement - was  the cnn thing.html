But, that brings up another question... How often do you change the<br>
logbook in the boxes that are close to where you live/work?  <br>
 <br>
I have had to change some of mine, due to leaks, etc... but, I always<br>
feel guilty - because now the people who go to visit don't get to see<br>
all the older stamps.  So, I go back and forth - do you pull them<br>
regularly so you have the stamp images to keep, or do you wait till the<br>
book is full and hope it doesn't get lost/destroyed/taken?<br>

Am I right in my understanding that CNN is doing something on <br>
letterboxing this weekend?<br>
<br>
Because, if they are, I'm seriously thinking about gathering up all <br>
my logbooks (replacing them with new ones) so that the stamps I have <br>
will be safe and I can enjoy them.  I'm still smarting after losing <br>
the two that disappeared. The boxes would still be out but have new <br>
journals.  And, maybe not all of them, but the more urban boxes that <br>
seem to get the most visitors. <br>
<br>
Crazy? More crazy than usual? <br>
