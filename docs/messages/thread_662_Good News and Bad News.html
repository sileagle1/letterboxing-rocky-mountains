First, the good news:  the Enginerd letterbox isn't a total loss.  <br>
It did stink of urine, but probably only got in through a small hole <br>
in the outer ziploc.  Nothing inside the box itself seemed to have <br>
been affected.  The logbook was damp, and was noted as such by the <br>
next to last stamper-inner, but wasn't discolored and didn't smell <br>
of urine.  Nothing inside the inner ziploc bags smelled like they <br>
had been peed on.  I'm not sure how the logbook got damp, but am <br>
relieved that can still be used.  We pulled the box but will find a <br>
more secure location to place it near that spot that won't run the <br>
risk of being used as a urinal.<br>
<br>
The bad news is that on our way to pull Enginerd, we stopped to <br>
check on Have a Homebrew and it was nowhere to be found.  It has <br>
become apparent that I need to do some serious thinking about my <br>
hiding places.  Lemony went missing, Bite my Shiny... had a tendency <br>
to wander, Enginerd got peed on and now Have a Homebrew has run <br>
away.  I believe I will be focusing on my F count over my P count <br>
for a while, and maybe take notes.<br>
<br>
I will keep working on improving my carving since I got a bunch of <br>
new Speedball tips for my birthday (which was spent letterboxing, <br>
imagine that).  After finding Homebrew missing, I was ready to give <br>
it all up, but finding boxes in Castle Rock, Boulder and Lyons, as <br>
well as dropping off one hitchhiker and picking up another, I can't <br>
seem to do it.  I'm going to do my first hitchhiker and hope to drop <br>
it off near Disney World in June.<br>
<br>
I also still can't log into the LbNA member section.<br>
<br>
Sorry for rambling, but had a lot to get off my chest.  Saw some <br>
familiar stamps this weekend, which always makes me smile. <br>
<br>
Thanks for listening,<br>

Dang! It's been a tough couple of weeks. In my opinion, it's just a <br>
lot more challenging to place letterboxes in an urban or suburban <br>
environment. There is a letterbox where I work, that I can watch for <br>
days and not see anyone go near it, and it still gets found by non-<br>
letterboxers from time to time.<br>
<br>
I sure hope that there will be another version of Have a Homebrew. <br>
Years ago I used to stop by a brewing supply shop in Boulder and talk <br>
about yeast and hops and malt with the wonderful people there. I <br>
don't know if it was owned by Charlie Papazian, but I got his <br>
newsletter and everyone that brewed thought of him as THE guru. <br>
<br>
I hadn't thought of that in years until I saw your clues for that <br>
letterbox. And I was hoping to get the chance to find it.<br>
<br>
Glad you're still hooked, Jrsy Boy.<br>
