parents wanted to plant a box in that area.  They went up there and had<br>
trouble finding a place where you did not have to pay a fee to visit. <br>
Then they got out of their car for 15 minutes to look around and a ranger<br>
gave them a ticket.  He was not eager to go back and place a box there. <br>
Maybe someday. :-)<br>

Subject: Cameron Pass area?<br>
<br>
So our family is heading to the hills this weekend, and doing a search<br>
turned up no clues to boxes up Poudre Canyon/Cameron Pass/Never Summer<br>
Wilderness area...I know a good hunk of this is State Parks, but are<br>
there any unpublished clues someone knows of?  It seems a lot of space<br>
to not have a single box!<br>
(and I am thinking we may rememdy that...teehee!  We are hoping to find<br>
some good places for a couple of plants,,our first and second!)<br>
<br>
Any tips on getting ok from State Park officials?  My MIL worked for<br>
them for years, and we will be up there with her, so I am hoping that<br>
she can help point me in the direction of a friendly person who may let<br>
it happen..<br>
<br>
Thanks a bunch!<br>
<br>
Staci<br>
