Those of you that have been lucky enough to find some of Kat's <br/>
letterboxes in Moab will not be surprised to hear that the view from <br/>
her letterbox in Carmel is breathtaking. I mean.....the seals and the <br/>
pelicans were just small pieces of the whole grand scheme that ebbs and <br/>
flows into those coves.<br/>
<br/>
And the stamp and logbook were really cool too!<br/>

that!<br/>

And yes..... the view is incredible and helps overlook the early-on-<br/>
learning-to-carve-stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Aspen and I are driving to Carmel for a couple of weeks tomorrow, so we <br/>
must have justed missed you, darn, I would love to show you my old town.<br/>
<br/>
Kat (who felt like she was part of it all after enjoying a few great <br/>
photos from Es!) Thanks, ES!<br/>
