<br/>
My daughter and I would like to plant a series that serves as a <br/>
reminder of all the wonderful places we visited on our relocation <br/>
trek from Utah to Florida in 2003. We have some great family memories <br/>
and we will write little stories to go with each plant. I want to <br/>
help the kids remember this important together time.<br/>
<br/>
We are hoping folks in each of these states will help. If you are <br/>
from one of the states below and would consider carving a stamp that <br/>
represents something for which your state is 'known' (your choice), <br/>
please contact me at 2brno2b@comcast.net . I will get these all <br/>
together and plant the series here in the Tallahassee area - "The <br/>
UT/FL Trek". I think I've found a great place for it. <br/>
<br/>
If interested, please email me off-lst at 2brno2b@comcast.net .<br/>

{Volunteers have spoken up for UT and CO.  Thanks!!!}<br/>
<br/>
UT (started in Ogden. 2 cars, , 2 parents, 4 kids, 2 jam-packed <br/>
trunks, lots of snacks &amp; one turtle!)  <br/>
WY (stayed at a really cool hotel with and painted murals on walls <br/>
and <br/>
pool)<br/>
CO (wasn't a 'necessary' state on our trip, but we wanted to hit as <br/>
many states as possible. Went to a little museum in the NE corner of <br/>
the state).<br/>
NE (blew a radiator in Kimball and stayed 4 unplanned days)<br/>
IA (barley clipped the corner of IA)<br/>
MO (stopped at a well kept hotel with an untreated, decorative fresh <br/>
water pool out front. Our turtle swam and thought she'd found heaven)<br/>
KS (Got lost in KC! LOL. Thanks to AAA.)<br/>
IL (special stop in Alton - one of one of my sons names)<br/>
KY (stayed an extra night in Paducah. We were exhausted and people <br/>
were so nice.)<br/>
TN (remember the color of green mostly. Beautiful.)<br/>
AL (we didn't stop anywhere in AL, just wanted to get there. Had <br/>
wanted to hit museums in Birmingham.)<br/>
FL (In was pitch dark when we hit the state and the drive on the 10 <br/>
from the P'cola area to Tally seemed neverending.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!!!<br/>
