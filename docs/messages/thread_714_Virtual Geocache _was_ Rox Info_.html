I "think" what you're describing is a virtual box.  You follow clues <br>
(same as a regular box, or in the case of a geocache, follow the <br>
coordinates) and then take a digital photograph of the location.  Then <br>
you post the photo on the computer, or email the photo to <br>
the "planter".  This way, there is no box left in the area, and you <br>
still get credit for a 'find'.  <br>
<br>
No, not as fun as a letterbox, but likely more environmentally <br>
friendly. <br>
<br>
Best,<br>
