<br/>
First of all - I must say that I am excited at the prospect of meeting <br/>
many of you at the scavenger hunt in Loveland!  I just recently <br/>
purchased a large pack of temporary pirate tattoos (you never know <br/>
when they might come in handy) along with some other booty and I am <br/>
thrilled to tell me hubby there WAS a reason I bought them.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to announce a new box in Fort Collins.  It's my first <br/>
traditional plant and I am curious to see what some of you more <br/>
expereinced boxers think.  It's titled "A pair of pears".  There is a <br/>
first finder's cert as well.  So race on over.<br/>

Like anyone confronted with the harshness of robbery on the high seas, you can be pessimistic at times. You can be a little bit unpredictable, but a pirate's life is far from full of certainties, so that fits in pretty well. Arr! <br/>
