<br>
First of all - I must say that I am excited at the prospect of meeting <br>
many of you at the scavenger hunt in Loveland!  I just recently <br>
purchased a large pack of temporary pirate tattoos (you never know <br>
when they might come in handy) along with some other booty and I am <br>
thrilled to tell me hubby there WAS a reason I bought them.  :-)<br>
<br>
I also wanted to announce a new box in Fort Collins.  It's my first <br>
traditional plant and I am curious to see what some of you more <br>
expereinced boxers think.  It's titled "A pair of pears".  There is a <br>
first finder's cert as well.  So race on over.<br>
<br>
Jessica (who feels she needs a better pirate name prior to April - <br>
suggestions???)<br>

A pirate name, ey?  hhhmmmmm....that one is a hard one!  Somebody <br>
once had a link on this site that was a pirate website that would <br>
help you come up with a pirate name, but, my gray brain can't <br>
remember it.  Anyone???<br>

Tattoo Jessi....I hope we ARE able to make it to the Loveland hunt to <br>
meet ya, but, it's too early yet to say for sure.  We're leaving to <br>
FL in a couple weeks to watch the Atlantis launch!  We are so <br>
excited!  So, we'll have to see what's shakin' when we return.  <br>

Your pirate name is: <br>
Black Bess Bonney <br>
<br>

Like anyone confronted with the harshness of robbery on the high seas, you can be pessimistic at times. You can be a little bit unpredictable, but a pirate's life is far from full of certainties, so that fits in pretty well. Arr! <br>
