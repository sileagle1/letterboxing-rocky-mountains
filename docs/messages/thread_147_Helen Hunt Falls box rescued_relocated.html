Pumpkin Princess and I were going for a few hikes in Cheyenne Canon <br/>
this past weekend and accidentally ended up letterboxing! We hadn't <br/>
planned on it so we didn't print out any clues. While walking up the <br/>
trail to the upper falls we found the Helen Hunt Falls letterbox bag <br/>
stuck on a branch hanging over the trail. Wow. We've found some easy <br/>
boxes before, but never had one materialize in front of us without <br/>
even looking for it! Apparently it had washed out of its hiding place <br/>
or someone had found it by accident and not replaced it. To keep it <br/>
from being stolen or thrown away we rehid the box. Unfortunately we <br/>
didn't know where it belonged so we had to hide it somewhere else. <br/>
Hopefully it will remain safe until it can be moved to its proper <br/>
home. We hid it in a pile of logs to the right of the trail about 20' <br/>
before the small wooden bridge near the top of the trail. Let me know <br/>
if you need a better description of the site. Hope it stays put. <br/>
Thanks for hiding the box. <br/>

Goddess and I found that box back on Jan 1, and the place was VERY <br/>
busy.  We had to sit around for quite some time before a break in <br/>
the traffic allowed us to stash it again.  As it is, the box was in <br/>
a location not very far off the trail, with what I consider to be <br/>
inadequate cover.  We hid it better than we found it, but I would <br/>
not be surprised if it was accidentally discovered and plundered.  <br/>
The box itself was very large and obvious in its hiding location.<br/>

Sorry about that. Not sure where I got the idea that it was your box. <br/>
I'll contact the placers directly.<br/>
