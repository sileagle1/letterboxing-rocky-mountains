 OH OH OH I forgot.... we bought some carving tools and some materials <br>
to carve and my husband made his first stamp - adorable but he said I <br>
couln't use it (pumpkin on one side, boo on the other) then he carved <br>
another eraser into a fire on one side and a marshmellow on a stick on <br>
the other - our first HITCHHIKER!!!!!  I'm so excited. I got a book <br>
made and it is all ready to go - just waiting for the right box to put <br>
it in!!!  YEAH!!! jamie<br>
