                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tis true, the ever vigilant preboxed has noted this 'lucky dog' has<br/>
indeed been on the move again. Made a trip to visit family in OK and<br/>
boxed our way over and back. <br/>
<br/>
We did try for your Clydesdales LB outside of Ft Collins, Es, but came<br/>
up empty. I feel like I got down under that bush pretty good, but keep<br/>
in mind the bum knee keeps me from my former agility! I'd hesitate to<br/>
call it missing; maybe Ramdelt could check on it, especially if he's<br/>
found it before.<br/>
<br/>
By all means, Dread Peach, meet Dread Es and find the elucive CO Nat<br/>
Monument LB up on the Mesa. The poor thing has already weathered one<br/>
winter (and spring and summer, now entering it's SECOND autumn)<br/>
without any attention at all. It is a sterling hike.<br/>
<br/>
Chasers, preboxed has it correct re: Face the Sun. The clues you want<br/>
are the ones WITHOUT the 'Gathering' notation; that's the permanant<br/>
location. A good excuse to actually go into the charming Grand Lake<br/>
proper.<br/>
<br/>
MANY THANKS! to preboxed for the cut paper, chip board, etc!!! I'll<br/>
check my stash for buttons and beads with big holes. Hope I can repay<br/>
the favor in some small way.<br/>
