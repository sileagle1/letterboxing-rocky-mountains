Got an email this morning letting me know that one of my placed <br/>
letterboxes had apparently been used as a urinal.  I'm not looking <br/>
forward to picking it up, but I suspect everything but the stamp will <br/>
be tossed and replaced.  Can't imagine anyone will want to stamp in on <br/>
yellow-stained pages.  I'll have to find a better hiding spot, too.  <br/>
Can't imagine this was an accident as the box was in a ziploc and the <br/>
contents of the box were also in ziplocs.<br/>
<br/>

I know it's been said before, but it really gets me that someone <br/>
would take the time and go to the trouble to ruin something like that.<br/>
<br/>
If someone finds a box, doesn't know what it is, and tosses it in the <br/>
trash it's one thing. But to realize that this is important to <br/>
someone and go out of their way to ruin it......?<br/>
<br/>
May their feet always be sore in addition to having to replace their <br/>
shoes! Cretins! <br/>
