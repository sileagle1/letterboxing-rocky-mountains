How totally fun! Throw the clues at us, and maybe between all of us, <br/>
we can help you win! That would buy a lot of carving stuff and <br/>
rubbermaids, not to mention how much pie you could get!<br/>

Okay---- here are the clues so far (and my ideas in parenthesis).<br/>
<br/>
1. It's south of the X-rock. (a cliff on the north side of town)<br/>
<br/>
2.I heard he was just cheering on his grandson. (?...new baseball <br/>
fields at the fairgrounds?)<br/>
<br/>
3. She just smiled and gave me a vega-mite sandwich. (From Men at <br/>
Work song "land of under"-- construction on 15th street bridge for a <br/>
trail underpass?)<br/>
<br/>
4. A local's guide to what's really up in the four corners. (This is <br/>
a tagline for a local magazine called Inside/Outside)<br/>
<br/>
5.Super-hero Snowdown nemesis, minus the medical personell and <br/>
General Hospital. (??? The theme for Snowdown this year is <br/>
Superheroes, so there are lots of people walking around in tights. <br/>
I'm thinking the clue refers to a Lex Luther type figure. The Mercy <br/>
Hospital is right by the bridge construction.)<br/>
<br/>
6. It's north of the Super 8 (a hotel south of town).<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas at all will be greatly appreciated. If you help me out I <br/>
would surely split the booty of Mastercarve (carves like butter) and <br/>
pie (carves like.....pie), or Butter pie .......butter pie?....the <br/>
butter wouldn't melt so I put it in a pie. (sorry)<br/>

Coupla' thoughts y-nought,<br/>
<br/>
Clue #2, a famous incident of someone cheering on his grandson <br/>
happened last year when convicted felon Charles Keating showed up at <br/>
a swim meet to cheer on his grandson.  Keating was convicted for his <br/>
role in the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan scandal of the 80s and spent 5 <br/>
years in prison.  I would investigate: 1) is there a Licoln Savings <br/>
in Durango, 2) any other connection with Lincoln, 3) there was a <br/>
Colorado (Denver?) man who was involved in Keating's prosecution, <br/>
don't know his name, but any connection with Durango?<br/>
<br/>
Clue #3, the song is Land Down Under, which refers to Australia.  <br/>
Vegemite is a uniquely Australian food.  I would investigate, 1) is <br/>
there a restaurant in Durango that serves Australian food, 2) is <br/>
there any other link between Australia and Durango, 3) what other <br/>
connotations of "down under" might have significance.<br/>
<br/>
Clue #4, Inside/Outside, get a copy of the current issue and <br/>
investigate for connections to the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Clue #5, the Snowdown poster this year shows Snowman and Weather <br/>
Woman battling Dr. Drought.  Minus the medical personnel, this would <br/>
just be "drought."  Investigate 1) areas of Durango affected by <br/>
drought, 2) organizations working against the drought, maybe the <br/>
local water company?<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

Suhweet!  I'll look into these. I think the Dr. Drought reference is <br/>
right on -- they had to close the fish hatchery during the drought. <br/>
There aren't any Australian restaurants in town but I think the down <br/>
Under might point to the Trail Underpass that they are working on. <br/>
The trail comes from the Hospital to the Fish Hatchery and then to <br/>
the underpass. <br/>
<br/>
I've got to check on the Keating thing, that sounds a lot like the <br/>
clues they used last year. <br/>
<br/>
I missed a couple of clues because, believe it or not, I'm at work, <br/>
but I'll get the rundown this evening and post the next four.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help!!!<br/>
