Hello Cluemasters-<br>
    We are getting down to the end of this treasure hunt and no one <br>
has found it yet. Yesterday there was a small altercation when the <br>
owner of El Rancho Bar on Main Street above Kroegers' Hardware heard <br>
noises on his roof. The two men up there had a list of Siver Bullet <br>
Clues and were sure that they were on the right track.<br>
<br>
More clues:<br>
<br>
18. The Gateway to Sleep. (Gateway was the former name of Santa Rita <br>
Park).<br>
<br>
19. The FCC won't allow us to give out this clue.<br>
<br>
20. Next Years theme is Snowdown Disco Do It.<br>
<br>
21. Truth, Justice and the European Way.<br>
<br>
22. Look. Up in the sky. Down. Pull.<br>
<br>
23. Misdirection, metaphor. Don't climb up on buildings anymore.<br>
<br>
24.No key is required. No one is gaurding it. (Last year the clues <br>
led to a hide-a-key under a table at a Chinese restaurant that opened <br>
a mailbox with the Bullet. In previous years it was in a Police car <br>
trunk. And in a Fireman's pocket).<br>
<br>
     I'm afraid I have less of an idea now than I had before. The <br>
last regular clue will come tonight but I might miss it because I <br>
will be at the parade. If no one finds it by tomorrow afternoon they <br>
will announce it's location on the radio. And I'm not really into <br>
that kind of "solving". If you have any more ideas until then I would <br>
be happy to check them out. And of course I'll let you know where it <br>
was and who found it.<br>
<br>
Thanks for playing this with me,<br>
<br>

Hmmm... a little too obscure for me.  I am guessing many of these <br>
can only be solved with some familiarity with the locality, so I <br>
fear I am at a disadvantage.  I'm rooting for you though, y-nought.<br>
<br>
Some thoughts:<br>
<br>
Clue #18: Some things that are considered by various groups to be <br>
a "gateway to sleep:" theta brain waves, alcohol, yawning, prayer, <br>
mattress or bedroom furniture stores, peaceful music.  ???<br>
<br>
Clue #19: see the following website for a discussion of what's <br>
prohibited by the FCC.  CAUTION: this site is explicit.  <br>
http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=Seven%20words%20you%20can%<br>
20never%20say%20on%20television<br>
<br>
Clue #22: Could refer to a skeet range?<br>
<br>
Clue #23: sounds like the "Krogers is under it" was a metaphor.<br>
<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

 Gosh, I wish I could help. It would be so helpful to just wander <br>
the streets there! How about, #18 hotels or motels coming into town -<br>
 gateway to sleep? But seeing where the past treasures were hidden, <br>
it really could be anywhere!<br>

I missed last night's clue and the early morning one today. Clue #27 <br>
is "We're really reaching and now you'll have to, too."  My thinking <br>
on this now is that it is on an "Old Timer" "European Style" toilet. <br>
One where you have to "reach up" and "pull down" to flush. DR. <br>
DROUGHT minus the medical personell is OUGHT, and that minus the GH <br>
for General Hospital is OUT. Then there is Our House (Out House) and <br>
the word the FCC won't let them say. Another possibility is baseball <br>
references with channel 2 and OUT and so on and so forth.....<br>
<br>
I don't know where an old euro water closet like that is in Durango. <br>
If anyone out there has stayed in some hotels here and this rings a <br>
bell please let me know.<br>
<br>
y- nought,... who celebrated National Pie Day without even knowing <br>
it.....I think it was pie-napple MMMMMmmmm.<br>

Some random thoughts:<br>
<br>
The east-west boundaries are actually pretty narrow, too bad the <br>
north-south are not the same.  East-west boundaries give you about a <br>
five block width where this can be hidden.<br>
<br>
If you went to Gateway (or Santa Rita) to Sleep you might be staying <br>
at the Doubletree Hotel near the park?  Or maybe a park bench?<br>
<br>
Our House, could be the Leland House or Red Cliff House hotels, both <br>
within the east-west boundaries.<br>
<br>
Get those two missing clues!<br>
