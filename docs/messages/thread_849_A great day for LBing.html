LOL We wanted to do three but after the second one hubby was ready to call it quits. So tomorrow the kids, dog and I may head back out. <br/>
We were able to get a couple hitchhikers planted. Ran into some geocachers that thought we were too. So we explained how ours worked and they showed us theirs. <br/>
<br/>
I did see some familiar stamps and names in the logs. Es, ravenwolf, Eoghan, JeLybean, CW sunseeker to name a few. It is much more fun looking through the logs when you recognize other's stamps. <br/>

Enjoy the nice weather this weekend and get outside! <br/>
