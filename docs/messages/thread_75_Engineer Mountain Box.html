Yes, I also sent an email to the webmaster regarding LaPlata County.  I<br/>
think they're just overrun with  emails to respond to from boxers<br/>
nationwide.<br/>

The webmaster is Wes Garrison, and here is his address directly:<br/>

Thanks for adopting the Box Canyon, box too.  I assume you already found<br/>
that one?<br/>

    I will just wait a bit and then contact Wes directly if it still <br/>
is listed with the Front Range.<br/>
<br/>
    I did find the Box Canyon Park box and it is in fine shape. A new <br/>
ink pad is the only thing it needs.<br/>
<br/>
    I would adopt the Andrews Lake box if I could find it. That one <br/>
may just be missing. I will poke around a little more before I give <br/>
up, though.<br/>
<br/>
  Cheers back at you,<br/>

I found it on 8/03/03 when I was on vacation and it was still<br/>
there but a little wet so may need another zip lock bag.<br/>
Email me offline if you need help finding it (I had a little<br/>
trouble finding it, too).<br/>
