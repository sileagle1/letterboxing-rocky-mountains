We are hoping the first finder will do a little doctoring. This box is extremely Urban and has been left in a very risky location. We ask that only experienced and careful boxers try to retrieve it.<br>
In an attempt to honor Holly, we did our best to offer the clues in her language. We hope that this frustrates and brings smiles to all who knew her.<br>
I wish we had done this in time for her to get to look for it. Happy trails Holly...you are remembered and will never be forgotten.<br>
