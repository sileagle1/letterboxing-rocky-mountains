                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a notice that beginning August 21, 2003, message attachements will not<br/>
be able to be viewed on the message board.  They will still arrive if you<br/>
receive "individual emails" but if you get a digest, or use the web to view<br/>
the messages, you will NOT see attachments.<br/>
<br/>
The best solution to this is to simply NOT use attachments!  :)  They're not<br/>
safe anyway on lists such as these.  So, if you've got something interesting<br/>
to share, either cut and paste, or save the interesting tidbit in the<br/>
"files" section of the list.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the catch:  To access access a group's Files and Photos area, you<br/>
need to have a "web membership" effective that same date.   To make sure you<br/>
have web memberships to all of your groups, please visit this page:<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/memwiz<br/>
Just run the wizard, it's easy!<br/>
<br/>
These changes (and a few others) are affecting ALL yahoogroups, not just<br/>
ours.  So - you may see messages like this if you subscribe to more than one<br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
