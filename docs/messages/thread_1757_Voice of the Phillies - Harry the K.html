                    <div class="plaintext-content">Early on this baseball season, I created a letterbox in honor of the late and great announcer of the Philadelphia Phillies, Harry Kalas.  This box was available to letterboxers at all the home games I attended this past season.  With this year's season coming to an unfortunate close for Phillies fans, I am now ready to send Harry on a postal journey to reach Phillies fans near and far that weren't able to get to any of the games I was at.  If you have an interest in getting Harry as a postal letterbox please send me your name and address in a message on Atlasquest or to my email:  fishthis@hotmail.com.  The message will end up in my junkmail box so be sure to put HARRY THE K in the subject line.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
