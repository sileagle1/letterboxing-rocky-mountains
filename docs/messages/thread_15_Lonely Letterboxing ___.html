<div><br/></div>Will do.  I suspect many of the posts will not really 
  apply to me, but this is the closest any have come.  I do consider myself 
  as being part of the Rockies (being a stones throw from Yellowstone, the 
  Tetons, and others) but there just aren't others out here yet.  Luckily a 
  few have been kind enough to come this way and leave some plants.<br/><br/>The 
  thing that appeals to me about this group is being able to communicate with 
  others who understand not only the terrain, but what it is like to be a 
  "lonely letterboxer."  I have to huff a bit when I see posts complaining 
  about only finding 15 of 20 boxes they looked for that day, or things like 
  that.  When I started here, there weren't that many boxes in my whole 
  state, and considering the fact that you could fit many of the eastern states 
  into one state out here, that's a lot of territory.  I love reading their 
  emails, but it is a whole different perspective when I still have to travel 
  hundreds of miles to get to boxes that I didn't find in my first week (there 
  were two in the east half of ID).  It is getting better, but it will be 
  fun to know<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm rambling a bit-sorry! (:  I'll end now. 
   See you all later, and if anyone is interested in coming to Idaho this 
  weekend, let me know.  We'd love to have more for our letterboxing 
  cookout.</blockquote></body></html>
