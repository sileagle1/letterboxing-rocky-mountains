<br>
I'm still doing a happy little skipping thing now and then because I <br>
got to share some ginormous cheeseburgers with the Ravenwolf Clan last <br>
night. Ravenwolf, Samurai Stamper, Little Wolf, Sparkle Fairy and <br>
Brother Raven are just delightful and seem to be having a great time <br>
solving clues, finding boxes and generally cheering up the natives in <br>
these parts. Plus, Ravenwolf dropped off a rare treasure that will be <br>
traveling around with me until it picks out a suitable home. (There'll <br>
be more on this later.)<br>
<br>
Then, with a song in their hearts and wind in their sails they headed <br>
north, despite the fact that those seas are known to be infested by <br>
Pirates!<br>
<br>
Good times........and all from a silly little hobby,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Y! (Hey I made a rhyme, gimme a dime...) We had a ball talking <br>
with you too! I see Ravenwolf has posted our finds and whew! what a <br>
load! It was amazing. Every box had a beautiful view or interesting <br>
story behind it. It was also loads of fun to read the log books and <br>
see who else had been there before us. We are already planning some <br>
trips around our hometown to both find and plant. <br>
<br>
Brother Raven is working on his carving skills so the "plants" will <br>
have handcarved stamps in them. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing <br>
wrong with store bought (some of them are so kewl!) but the <br>
handcarved add that little extra something. I will be making all the <br>
log books we plant as that is one of my areas for creative release. <br>
Will post them as soon as we get them planted. Try not to get too <br>
excited just yet for their release into the wild as we have a lot of <br>
yard work to do first but its coming along. :0)<br>
<br>
Thanks to All who plant boxes! What a wonderful hobby! I'm so glad <br>
we found each other.<br>

I'm dying to know why you crossed the stream 4 times!  We live on <br>
the river which is really high right now.  It never even occurred to <br>
me that the stream in the canyon would be high as well. I'm so glad <br>
you didn't get stuck! <br>
<br>
Es, revving up for a road trip and some serious stamping this weekend<br>

That little stream of yours crossed the road 4 times! So we had to <br>
cross 4 times! Apparently, it was so low when you placed the box, that <br>
you only had to cross once. Not so when we were there! Yea for Brother <br>
Raven's truck! Although - seriously - it didn't look near as high as <br>
it ended up being. In the middle of the first crossing, the water was <br>
over the wheel wells! A warning to passenger cars - that stream <br>
doesn't look to bad until you are in the middle of it!<br>
<br>
Bummer there weren't any pirates in GJ when we stopped by. Plenty of <br>
pirate booty tho... =3 Bummer we couldn't pick up more of it.<br>
