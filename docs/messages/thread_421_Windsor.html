There are two boxes that we visited:  Locomotion and Wizards.<br>
<br>
These are both beautifully carved.<br>
<br>
We especially liked the Locomotion because we had little ones with us.  We<br>
will have to go back after April 1st when the museum opens back up. <br>
Regardless it was a great afternoon.  Who could ask for better weather?<br>
<br>
I got my carving tools back from my Mom and we plan to plant another box<br>
up in the Red Feather area just after Thanksgiving.  We will go up to get<br>
our Xmas tree.. like we do every year and place a box at the same time. <br>
Sounds fun huh?<br>
<br>
Hoping that your SUN-day was just as fine.<br>
