                    <div class="plaintext-content">A month or so ago I took Raisin down to NW Pets to have her picture <br/>
taken for the Pet Friendly Magazine Dog Cover Contest.  Raisin was a <br/>
total wild child at the photo shoot and I swore that her pictures <br/>
would not turn out.  I was able to look at the proofs on the web <br/>
about a week later and even though one of her pictures turned out I <br/>
honestly thought it was not one of her better shots.  She just looked <br/>
so sad in it and it was not a very "crisp" shot either.  My copy of <br/>
the picture arrived in the mail about a week later and I stuck it up <br/>
on the frig not giving it a second thought.  That was until Saturday <br/>
when I received a call from Pet Friendly Magazine.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently Raisin's picture has been chosen out of about 130 pictures <br/>
as one of 8 finalists to be featured at the Family Pet Expo April <br/>
28th &amp; 29th at the Idaho Fairgrounds.  Visitors at the Pet Expo will <br/>
have a chance to vote on their favorite dog at the expo out of the 8 <br/>
finalists.  The dog with the most votes will be picked to be featured <br/>
on the Cover of Pet Friendly Magazine as the People's Choice.  The <br/>
other 7 dogs that are not selected will still have their picture <br/>
inside the magazine some time during the year.  So if you have a <br/>
chance to stop by and cast a vote I know Miss. Raisin would love the <br/>
support.  Although she remained remarkably unfazed by her new found <br/>
celebrity when I shared the good news with her on Saturday.<br/>
