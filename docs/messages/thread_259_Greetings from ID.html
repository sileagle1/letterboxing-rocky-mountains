                    <div class="plaintext-content">I didn't get a chance to write and let everyone know I was back from <br>
my rafting trip.  It was just amazing, by the way.  Everyone needs to <br>
do that one at least once, and to entice you a little further, I did <br>
leave a letterbox.  The only trick is that it can only be reached by <br>
raft.  That should add to the challenge.<br>
<br>
Hopefully I can make it to A-bear's gathering in Boise (well, in <br>
Star) I will have to see.  It is a five hour drive and a little <br>
tricky getting over there, but I always love getting together with <br>
her.  I also received the good news that Don and Gwen are coming my <br>
way soon after that, so I get to have another get-together with <br>
them.  They were the first boxers I ever met (along with A-Bear), so <br>
I am very excited to see them again.  They are just the greatest.<br>
<br>
Till later,<br>
