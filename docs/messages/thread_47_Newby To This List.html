the new places that your boxes took me to; places I had <br/>
never heard of but were great!  As you have probably<br/>
noticed, I also planted a box in Grand Lake near Rocky<br/>
Mountain National Park, one of my favorite places.  I made<br/>
sure the box is not on National Park land so hopefully it<br/>

time you are up that way (probably only accessibly in summer).<br/>
Thanks again for the great finds!<br/>

We're thrilled to have more boxes in our area!  Please let us know if <br/>
you are ever this way again so that we can meet to exchange, and <br/>
possibly get some of the (very few) boxes out here that you missed! <br/>
<br/>
I read your boxing report and was astonished at how many boxes you <br/>
were able to get in such a short period of time!  WOW!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - welcome aboard!<br/>
