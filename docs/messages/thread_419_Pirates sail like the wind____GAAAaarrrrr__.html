I knew I was going to have to be out there at DAWN to beat y'all! <br/>
LOL  I was on my way out of town (home) so left my folks' place <br/>
earlier than usual so I could skid into the parking lot of the <br/>
vegetable garden and careen down the path to the onion patch!!  The <br/>
only one around was a doe a few hundred feet away who wondered what <br/>
a pirate was doing so far inland. <br/>
<br/>
What time did you show up? I bet you were right on my tail!!  Woot!!<br/>
<br/>
Es, who had a blast and came &gt;&lt; this close to going in the dark last <br/>
night <vbg><br/>

&gt; Boy, Es, are you fast!  Of course, as you must know, I have a PhD <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; Latin and so I was thinking last night how I would go out this <br/>
&gt; morning and get some produce while it was still fresh, only to <br/>
find <br/>
&gt; the hour drive from the Springs has conspired against me!  <br/>
Arrrrgh! <br/>
&gt; (Exclaimed in proper pirate accent...)  But then, my anguish turns <br/>
&gt; to a big grin and I am glad you are the slightly quicker of us two.<br/>

JeLyBean, who is wondering if there is medication for this <br/>
