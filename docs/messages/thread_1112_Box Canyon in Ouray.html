Ouray.  We went to the falls this morning and wandered over to check up <br/>

under the tree.  A baggie with inky paper towel was tossed higher up <br/>
the hill.  I wandered all over the hill hoping to find the stamp and <br/>
journal with no luck.  We're guessing someone was either seen while <br/>
getting/rehiding it or didn't cover it from view and it was found by a <br/>

  We are tearing down our little OLD house and getting a systems built home (Modular)put in the same place. Brand new house without changing my address LOL. They will begin demolishing the end of June and by August should be getting everything back in place. Will take some work painting, unpacking, and landscaping again and everything else that needs to be done. <br/>
