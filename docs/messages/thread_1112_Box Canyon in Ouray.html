Ouray.  We went to the falls this morning and wandered over to check up <br>
on the box.  Sadly, we found only the container with the lid removed <br>
under the tree.  A baggie with inky paper towel was tossed higher up <br>
the hill.  I wandered all over the hill hoping to find the stamp and <br>
journal with no luck.  We're guessing someone was either seen while <br>
getting/rehiding it or didn't cover it from view and it was found by a <br>
hiker on the trail.  How sad.  It's been there for four years!  I was <br>
more upset with finding this box missing than any of mine so far!<br>

Box Canyon was the very first letterbox I ever found. It had stamps <br>
from everywhere in it. <br>

   <br>
  I am going to lose computer access the end of June because they will be tearing down my house and we will be lodging elsewhere while our new house goes up. I will try to keep up with my email whenever I get near a computer. <br>
   <br>
  Just give me a date and time and I will be there. <br>
   <br>
  Love those men in leather and tights!! <br>

  We are tearing down our little OLD house and getting a systems built home (Modular)put in the same place. Brand new house without changing my address LOL. They will begin demolishing the end of June and by August should be getting everything back in place. Will take some work painting, unpacking, and landscaping again and everything else that needs to be done. <br>
