Especially with Halloween coming up, he needs to get back out there.  Is there anyone close to that area, who has a bit of knowledge about it, that would be willing to replant him for me?<br>

<br>
QIL, you know that we tried to find a spot near his last resting place <br>
and there just wasn't a good spot to be found!  How far away from his <br>
resting place would you want to go?<br>
<br>
I've had a bit of the insane life myself lately and don't know if I can <br>
get to Lafayette in a timely fashion for you, plus, I'm worried about <br>
where to hide such a special box.  Autumn, are you available?  Anyone <br>
else in that area???<br>
<br>
Dread Peach...hoping that Fodor can get back in action because he's a <br>
very special box!<br>

Thanks Peach, you truly are one!  <br>

  Garrr!  I know.  I don't know as I will be able to get it anywhere near as close as it was before.  Anyone know if there is an open space type park anywhere in the fairly close area?  This box is so special to me that I am going to be a complete whacko about its placement.  I guess I better just find a way to get myself down there and do some poking around.  There has to be a sunless hidey hole for my boy around somewhere!<br>
