                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi - I'm looking for letterboxes in the northern Colorado region <br/>
(Fort Collins - Loveland) and haven't come up with anything.  Does <br/>
anyone know of any boxes stashed in my area?  I tried googling <br/>
Horsetooth, the Poudre, and a bunch of other places for letterboxes <br/>
(and of course, I checked the letterbox.org site) but it appears the <br/>
closest letterboxes to me are in WY (which I already have).  I know <br/>
there's a bunch in the Denver area (Golden, Boulder, etc.) and I <br/>
definitely plan to get down there at some point, too.  <br/>
<br/>
I just can't believe that there aren't any letterboxes in the little <br/>
old hills just to my west - if anyone knows of any near Fort <br/>
Collins, please let me know!  And yes, I'm planning on planting at <br/>
least one box in the area to remedy this sad lack of letterboxes...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
