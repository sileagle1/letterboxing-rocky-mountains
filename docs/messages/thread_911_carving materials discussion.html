OK, so I'm new to the hobby - but I can identify with this comment! :-)<br/>
(even finding LBs too)....I JUST managed to find the Budweiser one in <br/>
Ft. Collins on Saturday...in the dark, in the mud, with my butt in the <br/>
air on that county road.  Thank goodness I'd just put a flashlight in <br/>
my bag and security didn't pick that moment to drive by.<br/>
<br/>
I pulled tree bits out of my hair all the way home.  It smelled like a <br/>
pine tree inside the car! But I was GONNA get that "one last one" for <br/>
the day....but I was close to an "episode" after a long day of boxing...<br/>
<br/>
"I can't work today because I impaled my finger while carving some <br/>
spooky eyeballs and I can't serve complimentary beverages!"  "Nice <br/>
try."  <br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't it be great if we all "had" to reverse our time management <br/>
priorities viz work and hobbies?  "I don't have time to come to work <br/>
today, I'm too busy with all my hobbies and just can't find the time."  <br/>
(instead of the frustrating reality we all have to deal with!)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously... really helpful topic on carving materials!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
