Now that you have found the location you can find the location <br/>
address in the phone book or on the web. Once you are at the location <br/>
you will head to the cross walk to the east of the building.  You <br/>
will cross the street heading at 120 degrees towards a body of <br/>
water.  Continue at 120 degrees (south east) and walk down the hill <br/>
on the grass towards a large group of rocks near the waters edge that <br/>
conceal a drainage spout.  Watch your footing as some of the rocks <br/>
are loose.  The box is hidden inside the triangle opening between the <br/>
boulders under a couple of river rocks.  The cute little shop that is <br/>
there on the corner is open Monday thru Saturday 10 a.m.  7 p.m.  <br/>
They are closed on Sundays.  They are unaware of the box.  This can <br/>
be a busy intersection depending on the time of day so please be <br/>
discrete and hide well.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if the box is missing or in bad repair <br/>
