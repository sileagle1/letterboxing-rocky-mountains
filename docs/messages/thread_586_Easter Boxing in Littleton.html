What a beautiful day, after so much cold and ugliness!  Spent the <br/>
afternoon in Littleton and found Oh Dear 2, Fido, and then headed up <br/>
to Deer Creek and traversed a very muddy slippery trail to get the <br/>
Rattlesnake Gulch box.<br/>
<br/>
The best part of the day was arriving at Oh Dear, only to meet up <br/>
with Kim (Phoenix Ascending), Tim, and little Connor who were <br/>
stamping into T-I-Double G - Rrrrr!  So the four of us did the Oh <br/>
Dear and Fido boxes together.  What a pleasant surprize to get <br/>
exchanges in addition to my three finds for the day. <br/>
<br/>
The light got away from me (and my muddy boots took time to clean <br/>
before getting in my car) so I wasn't able to get Swimming in <br/>
Opposite Directions, but that's next on my list, I think!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all had a lovely holiday - and got some boxing in on this <br/>
beautiful day!<br/>
<br/>

(who is bummed that conflicting things will prevent a drive to Moab <br/>
for the gathering *kicks a stone in frustration* Dag nab it!)<br/>
