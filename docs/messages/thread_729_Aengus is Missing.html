I'll be carving a new stamp and putting another box together to place <br/>
nearby. I rather liked Aengus and I really liked the fact that a few <br/>

visit the new one too.<br/>

Aengus last summer.  Perhaps there are wee baby marmots now that <br/>
haven't been taught what they can and can't chew on yet. <br/>
<br/>
If Aengus has wandered to his new home before our next trip over,  <br/>
we will surely stop to say hello and hear his poetry again!<br/>

Es, who is always sorry to see a box have troubles<br/>
