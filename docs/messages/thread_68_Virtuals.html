gathering.  So - I went back to the 'big list' to find my post that <br>
had the URL's for the virtuals that I'm aware of.  At this point, <br>
these are not listed on the LbNA main website.<br>
<br>
Happy virtual hunting on rainy days to come!<br>

Hey there!  The subject of virtual boxes comes up from time to time.  <br>
I am hopeful that at some point Wes and his wonderful crew of <br>
webmasters and mistresses can put this information up on the LbNA <br>
site.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile ... here is my list of Virtuals.  Apologies if the links <br>
get cut off.  You may have to cut and paste the links since some of <br>
them are long:<br>
<br>
There's one more, but it's a real box that is/was also available as a <br>
virtual on the old site. For some reason, that box is not listed on <br>
the new lbna site, so I'm not going to post that one. I did email Wes <br>
with this list, and that additional box. He can contact that person <br>
to see if they still want their box (virtual or otherwise) to be <br>
listed.<br>
<br>
Here's the list:<br>
