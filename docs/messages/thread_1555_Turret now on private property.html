Turret letterbox, that the location where it is placed has become <br>
private property at some point.<br>
<br>
The nice folks who sent the note, family campers, sought permission <br>
from the owners before doing the hike.  They are going to send me the <br>
contact info for the owners, but I am thinking I will probably pull <br>
this box eventually.<br>
<br>
If anyone is going to be in the Salida area and wants to help me <br>
retrieve the box, I'd appreciate an email.<br>
