Speaking of sick-hard letterboxes..........I just bought a copy of <br>
the Solution Book to A Treasure's Trove.<br>
<br>
For those of you that aren't familiar with that book, it's a well <br>
illustrated fairy tale that also contains the clues to find 13 jewel <br>
encrusted insects that were hidden all over the U.S. It's a really <br>
fun children's book even without the treasure hunting part. Anyway, <br>
all jewels were found last year, so the author published the solution <br>
book along with the stories behind each of the finders. <br>
<br>
Man! No wonder I couldn't make any headway. The clue to the one that <br>
was found in Moab depended on a person making a nuber key based on <br>
which way dandelion seeds were pointing on the margin of one page. <br>
(Yikes!)<br>
<br>
My hat is off to the feind that devised this treasure hunt and <br>
especially to the people that actually solved these riddles. Some <br>
folks were actually figuring this stuff out, driving ten hours, only <br>
to find that there were other treasure trovers in the area looking <br>
for the same jewels!<br>
<br>
On a similar note, I'd like to give a heads up to all you clue <br>
brainiacs that I will be needing help again next week in the Snowdown <br>
Search for the Silver Bullet......details later.<br>

C'mon Sun!<br>
