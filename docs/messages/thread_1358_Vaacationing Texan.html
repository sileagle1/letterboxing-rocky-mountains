                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ah sure, now you ask!!  Until November I was living about an hour<br/>
south of Island Park, but now I'm in Cardiff, Wales so a meetup might<br/>
be a smidge difficult.<br/>

Be sure to check out the boxes I've left around there.  I've enjoyed<br/>
planting them.  By the way, the Big Springs series has one<br/>
missing--the one by the cabin.  I thought I had changed the clue, but<br/>
might not have.  I also got a note the other day that made me thing<br/>
that one of the signs in the clue might be missing.  If that is so<br/>
keep an eye out for the tree that is chopped off right on the trail<br/>
side.  I believe the other clues are all still good, be sure to check<br/>
out Chief Joseph. I'll admit, it's one of my favorite stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy my second home.  While you're out there go see Mesa Falls and<br/>
think of me.  I really miss that area sometimes.  It holds such<br/>
memories for me.<br/>
