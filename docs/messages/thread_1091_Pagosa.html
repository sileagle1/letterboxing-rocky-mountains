                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, team JeLy just returned the candy wagon to the store after a <br>
great weekend in Pagosa Springs.  It turned out to be more of a sit-<br>
on-your-butt-until-you're-waterlogged kind of weekend than a max-out-<br>
your-F-count kind of weekend, but I did manage to squeeze a little <br>
letterboxing in.<br>
<br>
We found two, one of which was littlewaav's Pagosa Hot Springs box.  <br>
The box had previously been plundered by villainous geocachers who <br>
wrote in the log, "took stamp, left 50 cents."  Fortunately for us <br>
Beans, the heroic FunHog had visited the box a mere two days before <br>
us, removed all the geocaching ...stuff... and (get this) carved an <br>
excellent reproduction of the original stamp right there on the <br>
spot.  She certainly deserves the Congressional Medal of Honorable <br>
Letterboxing if you ask me.  Way to go FunHog, my many thanks.<br>
<br>
We managed to leave one, the Piedra River Hot Springs box, clues to <br>
which will be posted soon.  We also left two HHs in the area.<br>
<br>
The highlight of the trip was MEETING (yes!) y-nought and La <br>
Paloma.  y and LP, I'm sorry our time was so short, but you are as <br>
great in person as you are in writing.  I hope to talk with you a <br>
little more over the summer when we get back down there or you get <br>
up here.<br>
<br>
I left in y's care another box which we had intended to plant but <br>
ran out of time for... tentatively called the Land of the Ancients <br>
box.  Funny thing is goddess and I forgot to stamp our logs with it <br>
before I handed it over to y, so we will actually have to go back <br>
down and FIND it to get our own stamp in our journals.<br>

I did get to meet the International Bean of Mystery for a quick <br>
conference on tricky letterboxes. I should have known there was <br>
something up when he asked if I had ever been to Piedra Hot Springs. <br>
My answer was "no" so this will be one of those times where I get to <br>
go to a new place right here in my own backyard, all for a <br>
letterbox, and clothing optional to boot! Plus he took it easy on us <br>
and wrote the clues to this one in a human language....English even!<br>
<br>
I was also amazed that Funhog was able to carve a replica of the <br>
original stamp for Pagosa Hot Springs right there on the spot. I <br>
also noticed that she wrote, "took everything else out, because THIS <br>
IS NOT A GEOCACHE." Which means Funhog at least got to keep the <br>
fifty cents.<br>
<br>
Thanks for coming down JeLy, and I hope to see you on a trail in <br>
your area before too long.<br>

<br>
".... That silly letterbox was smashed beyond recognition, had no <br>
stamp, no plastic bags, a wet logbook and several pieces of geotrash <br>
in it. I just couldn't leave it that way! Besides, I wanted the <br>
stamp image in my journal, too. Heck, I even got four whole quarters <br>
out of the deal... Unfortunately, it cost me twice that to get that <br>
Nestle Quick box. It was actually quite pleasant to spend the time <br>
sitting by the river carving that little stamp. I know it wasn't <br>
exactly the same as the original but I made an effort to reproduce <br>
it...."<br>
<br>
Way to go, Funhog, you are my hero!<br>

Mesa Verde that very evening. That kept me moving.<br>
<br>
I did manage to stop along the way in Durango to pick up a bag of<br>
jalapeo cheddar potato chips at the health food store (health food???<br>
right!) and a couple of very nice letterboxes. I took a stroll along<br>
the Animas River and added Esmerelda's lovely stamp to my logbook.<br>
Then I was led by a virtula y-nought on a tour of the very peaceful<br>
college campus. What a bonus that was!<br>
<br>
I do hope to make it back to the area one day. It was my first time<br>
there and was entirely too short. You folks live in a very special<br>
part of the world. Funhog<br>

I am curious about this enigmatic letterboxer at Mesa Verde. By any <br>
chance was he selling Grade "A" White PZ-Cut out of his trunk at <br>
ridiculously low prices? I've heard that is happening more and more <br>
these days<br>
