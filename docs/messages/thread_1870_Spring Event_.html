<br/>
Well, the snow is melting, and the weather is heating up which means it is time to come out of hibernation and greet our fellow LBers for the season.<br/>
<br/>
And this year is going to start with a bang. Our very own patriarch/matriarch of letterboxing (The oh-so-fabulous Thai's) are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary, and would like us to celebrate with them. =3<br/>
<br/>
As an emissary to the party-ing, I am assisting in logistics. I want to throw a couple dates out there to everyone so that we can gather as many people as possible to wish them well into their 51sh year of wedded bliss. (And if any of you have met them, you know it truly is bliss.) <br/>
<br/>
SO - how many of us can make Memorial Day weekend? Are lots of my fellow Coloradans going to be going camping that weekend? Maybe do we have some folks in the Rocky Mountain region who may be close by? If that doesn't work, is there another weekend after May 11th that is preferable? Maybe the first weekend in June? Or May 15th?<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts? Opinions? <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing everyone!<br/>

The only day you listed that we can't do is May 15th...that's a Tues???  <br/>
<br/>
We have Cappy's birthday May 24th and we usually do something over Memorial Day for it, but we can work around that if you plan something that weekend.<br/>
<br/>
However, if we wait until sometime in June for Aljan, that would be awesome to have her there and I'm sure the Thai's would love that!<br/>
<br/>
Hugs, Peach<br/>
