                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a couple of reminders from your friendly list owner/moderator:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Attachments dont come through to the group at all.  If you have a <br/>
file to attach, stick it in the files section, or cut and paste the <br/>
text into your post.  This is to protect all the list members from <br/>
attached viruses.  <br/>
<br/>
2)  Forwards are like attachments.  Best to not hit "forward" but cut <br/>
and paste the text into your post or email to the group.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Snipping is a personal pet peeve.  When you respond to someone's <br/>
post, please snip out any unnecessary parts of the email you're <br/>
responding to.  It's not necessary to include that person's entire <br/>
message, and the one before that, and the one before that.  :)  <br/>
Subscribers who are getting the digest will have to weed through a <br/>
villion posts that start with &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; before actually being able <br/>
to read the next message.  So, this is just courteous to your list-<br/>
mates.<br/>
<br/>
4)  Thanks to the moderators, we instituted a "first post is <br/>
moderated" system for this board.  This means, the first time you put <br/>
a message to the group - we get it first and give it the okie dokie.  <br/>
Why bother?  Oh ... to reduce the number of instances where that <br/>
message invites you to invest in some stock or lengthen the size of <br/>
your member.  Now ... if they were advertising pie?  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping to keep this list working so smoothly! And may <br/>
there always be a box at the end of your trail!<br/>

savvy enough to post about pie.  That being said (and I can only <br/>
speak for myself and not the other moderators) ... if someone <br/>
submitted a first post and the post contained the clues to a lifetime <br/>
supply of free pie ... good for only the first finder?<br/>

Um yeah ...<br/>
Ya'll can forget about finding that pie treasure before me!  :)<br/>

eh?)<br/>
