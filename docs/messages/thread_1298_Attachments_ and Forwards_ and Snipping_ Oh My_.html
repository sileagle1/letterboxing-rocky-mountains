                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a couple of reminders from your friendly list owner/moderator:<br>
<br>
1)  Attachments dont come through to the group at all.  If you have a <br>
file to attach, stick it in the files section, or cut and paste the <br>
text into your post.  This is to protect all the list members from <br>
attached viruses.  <br>
<br>
2)  Forwards are like attachments.  Best to not hit "forward" but cut <br>
and paste the text into your post or email to the group.<br>
<br>
3)  Snipping is a personal pet peeve.  When you respond to someone's <br>
post, please snip out any unnecessary parts of the email you're <br>
responding to.  It's not necessary to include that person's entire <br>
message, and the one before that, and the one before that.  :)  <br>
Subscribers who are getting the digest will have to weed through a <br>
villion posts that start with >>> >>> >>> before actually being able <br>
to read the next message.  So, this is just courteous to your list-<br>
mates.<br>
<br>
4)  Thanks to the moderators, we instituted a "first post is <br>
moderated" system for this board.  This means, the first time you put <br>
a message to the group - we get it first and give it the okie dokie.  <br>
Why bother?  Oh ... to reduce the number of instances where that <br>
message invites you to invest in some stock or lengthen the size of <br>
your member.  Now ... if they were advertising pie?  ;)<br>
<br>
Thanks for helping to keep this list working so smoothly! And may <br>
there always be a box at the end of your trail!<br>

Ya'll can forget about finding that pie treasure before me!  :)<br>
