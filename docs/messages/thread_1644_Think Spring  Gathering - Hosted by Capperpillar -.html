Yes, it seems like winter is just getting started, but it's time <br/>
to "Think Spring" for our local boxes. Do you have boxes that need <br/>
some stamp and/or logbook maintenance done before spring? Or maybe an <br/>
idea for a new box or series? Others attending this event may even be <br/>
willing to let you help with some maintenance on their boxes. This is <br/>
a time to get together and work on getting those stamps carved and <br/>
logbooks made so our local boxes are in great shape for the spring!<br/>
<br/>
This will also be a chance to meet (and exchange with) other boxers <br/>
in the area that you may not have met yet or haven't seen for a <br/>
while. Even if you haven't carved a stamp yet, this would be a great <br/>
opportunity to come and try it and maybe even get some hints from <br/>
other carvers. :)<br/>
<br/>
Bring along any supplies and tools that you already have and would <br/>
like to use. It would be preferable if you already have your images <br/>
transferred or ready to transfer for carving. I can bring an iron, <br/>
acetone, and paper cutter if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
This meeting time was determined by the availability of the Community <br/>
Room at the Eagle Public Library. If attendees are interested in <br/>
getting together someplace else before 1:30 for lunch and exchanges, <br/>
I'm open to that as a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
Please RSVP so I know who all to contact in case of any changes (e.g. <br/>
the lunch thing, changes due to weather, etc.). AQ-mail Capperpillar <br/>
with any questions/comments/ideas for this event. Thanks!<br/>
