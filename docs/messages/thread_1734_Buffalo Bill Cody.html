I've just gotten a note from someone who couldn't find dear Bill.  If any of you are going to be in that area and know where he's hidden, I would so appreciate it if you could peek under his rock and see if he's still there!  <br>
<br>
I've had a large number of finds on him this summer and one very recently.  I'm hoping the new searchers were just looking in the wrong place and Bill is safely hunkered down!<br>

I'll check on him tomorrow.  I'm sure the box is alive and well . With all the rain this summer, it probably is a little harder to find.<br>

I figured if someone who knew exactly where he was went and looked I'd know for sure.  It seems like a very unlikely spot to get muggled!  But you just never know.<br>
