I placed the fourth logbook in my little Union Station letterbox today, <br/>
so it's again ready for more visitors.  I can't believe it's lasted as <br/>
long as it has, though if it were always in the condition I found it in <br/>
today, it would have been long gone.  I figure it must have been <br/>
muggled, because everything was jammed inside so that the box wouldn't <br/>
close and it was replaced so that it was clearly visible to passers <br/>
by.  I really doubt that any of our area letterboxers would have left <br/>
it that way.<br/>
<br/>
I would have been really disappointed to lose the logbook that I took <br/>
out of there today.  It had Astro D's 500th find in it, Autumn's old <br/>
stamp (the one lost on Mt Doom), some DNC finders and a host of other <br/>
stamps and notes that I would have missed out on.  Needless to say, I'm <br/>
glad that I checked on it when I did.<br/>

OMG!  I just found this box and I didn't leave it that way!  I made <br/>
really sure everything was packed tightly in there and it closed <br/>
properly.  I was vary discreet and made sure no one saw me put it <br/>
back or take it out.  it was well hidden when I replaced <br/>
it.  Hopefully I wasn't the cause!  Looks like there may have been a <br/>
finder or two after me, though.  Bummer!  Glad you were able to save <br/>
the log, allemeyn!  if the muggles found it because of me, I'm really <br/>
sorry!  I think I was really stealthy, but it was really busy that <br/>
day... so who knows.  Maybe I wasn't as good as I thought.<br/>

I'm sure you didn't leave it that way, Bali!  I'd be pretty surprised if any boxer would have left it open and exposed and, as for being muggled, I'm honestly surprised that it hasn't happened sooner, given the location.  Don't worry about it at all - after all, there was no harm done to the logbook or the box.  I'm just glad that you finally got to find some boxes on one of your visits.<br/>

I'm very glad you did - that's what prompted me to go down and check on it.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about it last night, and I wondered whether it was Union Station trying to reject the letterbox.  Boxes have something of a tradition of going missing there.  <br/>
<br/>
In all seriousness, it probably was muggled - which happens.  I am only lucky that it was found by a good muggle who replaced it (albeit poorly) rather than keeping it or throwing ir away.<br/>

Hi Gang<br/>
What is going on with your Union Station box??? I did not leave it<br/>
exposed to the weather. All I commented on when I found it was that the log<br/>
