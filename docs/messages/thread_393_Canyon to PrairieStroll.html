                    <div class="plaintext-content">CW Sun Seeker came down today and we went on a hunt for this box.  First<br>
off - let me tell you, if you are going there from Denver - look at a<br>
MAP!  The directions take you very far south... <br>
 <br>
Some how we managed to skip one of the steps, so it took us forever to<br>
FIND the box!  DUH!  But, once we realized our mistake, it was found<br>
quickly.<br>
 <br>
If you have little kids... a stroller works great for the majority of<br>
the trip.  But, the last part is not at all stroller friendly.  We had<br>
to leave the stroller behind to finish this one.<br>
 <br>
Nice stamp - hand carved!  good day.  Had hoped for more boxes but my<br>
terrible ability to follow directions and detours for road work really<br>
stinks.  Not to mention that it got really cold and started to rain - ok<br>
sprinkle.<br>
 <br>
On the way home, we stopped so that Cathy could get Harry's Heaven and<br>
Twenty Mile.  Both were found and in good condition.  We also stopped at<br>
Sea Goat (one of my boxes) which was still in place and DRY!  woohoo!<br>
And hey - there is only ONE stamp in that book!<br>
 <br>
I am hoping we can get together again next week so that we can do more<br>
boxes in this area or up in Ft Collins.  We also talked about a day trip<br>
to Colorado Springs!  My husband thinks I have gone crazy!<br>
