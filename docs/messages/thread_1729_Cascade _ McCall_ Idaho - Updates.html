My findings were significantly better than they were in Cascade when we last camped.  All of my McCall boxes were safe and sound.  In addition I replanted my two missing boxes in Cascade.  Here are my maintenance notes:<br>

Paw Print Friend - Box #5  Replanted  Very close to the original hiding spot.<br>
<br>
And a little tickle to wet your LB appetite for adventureI planted two "Nighttime Only" boxes in Cascade!  But these boxes are only for those who are brave enough to search for them<br>
