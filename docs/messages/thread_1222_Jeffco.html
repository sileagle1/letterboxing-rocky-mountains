I HOPE the link takes you to my comment, specifically.  The AQ thread, <br/>
well...it's not nice to start with, so bear with....and please scroll <br/>
to my own comment if the link doesn't go where I meant you to go.<br/>
<br/>
So....after posting that comment I thought:<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't it be so cool to call up the person in charge of the folks <br/>
who go out and check on boxes and say Howdy?!  What if I could get on <br/>
their next meeting agenda and/or stop by for 15 minutes or so and say <br/>
THANKS for being so letterboxing friendly?  What if I could offer to <br/>
bring/carve stamps/bring them "schwag" or other greetings from RM <br/>
boxing folks? Ask them where THEY think some boxes should be <br/>
located...with ideas to bring back to the group? Etc/etal...<br/>
<br/>
Does this idea do anything for you?  If so, please let me know what <br/>
your ideas are!   <br/>
<br/>
I have quite a bit of time off between now and January would love to <br/>
stop by say howdy/thanks/dork it up (good LAWD I'm GOOD at dorkin' it <br/>
up, making a Fool of meself ALL in the PREsuit of fun - and yes Suit <br/>
Up CAN mean silly costumes - I'd even see if pictures are possible) <br/>
maybe bring by some PIE and well...just make 'em smile!<br/>
<br/>
Getting the point.. of what's possible?  If there's ANY energy at <br/>
all 'round this idea, I WILL call 'em up and see if I can stop by!  <br/>
I'm just THAT silly, with very little encouragement...though some <br/>
would be wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts please?  Anything you'd like to contribute?<br/>
Cheers and <br/>
Happy HollyDays!<br/>

    Endearingly called Jeffco, these very box friendly folks USED to<br/>
require letterboxing permits, but have (so I'm told - no idea how long<br/>
it took as that PREdates me...) decided that 'boxing encourages folks<br/>
to visit their properties. They've even issued little stickers to<br/>
their rangers/volunteers. I consider it a Badge of Honor (and<br/>
encouragement) when I check on my boxes located w/in their<br/>
jurisdiction to see that I Got One! - A sticker from Jeffco and NO<br/>
email telling me to remove/relocate one of my boxes! Not ONE yet!<br/>
Wahoooooooo!<br/>
<br/>
    Heck, I've half thought I should carve them a stamp or so - so I<br/>
can see something more interesting than one of their stickers in my<br/>
(and others') boxes when the letterboxing Rangers come to visit. (Oh,<br/>
and I HAVE GOT to wonder...do they have their own logbooks while out<br/>
hunting 'boxes while at work? I sure HOPE so!)<br/>
<br/>
    And...well ....to carve some of them a stamp would SO amuse the<br/>
crap out of me at least, and maybe them as well.<br/>
<br/>
    Just 'cause it IS so, doesn't mean doesn't mean it has to STAY<br/>
that way!<br/>
<br/>
    Any ideas for a stamp image to carve for the Jeffco loverlies? I<br/>
think they are WAY overdue for a HollyDay PREsent!<br/>

I'm all for positive relations between those powers-that-be and our<br/>
responsible letterboxing community. I've seen those little stickers in<br/>
the Jeffco LBs and wondered myself if any of the rangers have picked<br/>
up the hobby while making their rounds.8-D  I'm in for making a box or<br/>
just carving a stamp or making a log book or contributing a watertight<br/>
box or whatever. I say go for it, preboxed!<br/>

And a thank-you letterbox? That's an awesome idea!<br/>
<br/>
The Jeffco Parks are just SO nice and I think anything you do to thank <br/>
them for allowing 'boxes would be great. They DID dig up my Onion, but <br/>
at least they had the courtesy to call me and let me know what <br/>
happened. Not many parks would even care.<br/>

    I might be talked into helping out with a box or some stamp carving.  Not until the Holidays pass though.  I don't have a ny boxes planted in Jeffco yet but I have two that are living in my head and will reside around Red Rocks when they find the exit door.<br/>
