<br>
I found Blue Suede Shoes and Water Beetle in November of 2004. I hope <br>
that someone else on this list has found them more recently.<br>
<br>
I see Blue Suede Shoes has a note on the clue that it was removed soon <br>
after I found it because a beaver cut down it's hiding place.<br>
<br>
Dang Beavers...almost as bad as Marmots!<br>

I found Water Beetle in Nov 2005.  Blue Suede Shoes was missing at <br>
that time, though we did give it a try anyway - with no luck.  I found <br>
Urva Ursi in October 2005.<br>

website (I find their email service can be hit or miss) and she<br>
indicated that the two were still active. So with these recent reports<br>
I think Uva-Ursi and Water Beetle are worth a try. If it were just me<br>
going, I'd try them all and then some! But my family is not into LBing<br>
as much as I; I'll be lucky to get a just few hunts into our week. I<br>
want the few that we try to be solid leads. We're staying northwest of<br>
Ft Collins so I'll be hunting for Flying Javalinas too. Any other<br>
recommendations in that area would be appreciated :)<br>
