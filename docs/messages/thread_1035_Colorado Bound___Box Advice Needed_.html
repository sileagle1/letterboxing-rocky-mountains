<br>
I need to pick your brains for a moment as our band of misfits is <br>
heading to Colorado the last week in March to ski for Spring Break.  <br>
As some of you know Alex (Lizman) and I travel with a couple of non-<br>
boxers.  I am not sure if I will be allowed to box during our get <br>
away however, every good boxer must be prepared that just such an <br>
opportunity will present it's self on the road.  And naturally to <br>
help my odds I am going to print every clue between Boise and <br>
Colorado!  Okay I can't leave everything to chance.<br>
<br>
I need to double check that I am looking at the right boxes in the <br>
right area before I start printing clues.  We will be staying in <br>
Keystone off of River Run Road and will be skiing at Copper Mountain <br>
for the week.  Checking maps in the area that seems to put me in <br>
Summit County for boxes.  Does that sound right?  Would the closest <br>
boxes to me by in Breckenridge and Frisco?  And if so does anyone <br>
have some recommendations for me with box statuses etc.    <br>
<br>
Let me know what you think and if I am on the right track if you have <br>
time!<br>
<br>
Thanks so much!  Blackvelvetrav<br>

P.S. I am going to post my questions on Atlas Quest Too in case no <br>
one see's it here.<br>

My general impression is that things will still be under snow and pretty<br>
unavailable around Frisco, but maybe we can recommend some good boxes en<br>
route.  I imagine that you'll be coming right through the Grand Junction<br>
area, and those boxes should be pretty available depending on the<br>
weather.  Esmerelda should be able to help out in that department.  She's<br>
got a number of really fabulous boxes along that I-70 corridor.  Maybe<br>
you can pick a box or two (with not much of a distance) and convince your<br>
non-boxing friends to stretch their legs a few times.<br>
<br>
One box to check out ... now that I'm thinking of it is Yes by Aljan<br>
Sundance.  That can't be too far off the ski area!!!  One box is outside<br>
and one box is inside (a restaurant) and it's a fabulous box!!!<br>
<br>
Kat and Boxer Lover might be of help for the I-70 stretch over there in<br>
Utah.  Also, it's an hour or so from Frisco to Golden and there are GREAT<br>
boxes in that area.  Again it all depends on snow depth ... it can be hit<br>
or miss this time of year ... balmy days or blizzards or anything in<br>
between.  Can you escape the non-boxers for a while?  I bet some of us<br>
Front Range boxers would be willing to descend upon Golden and catch<br>
dinner somewhere and do some exchanges.<br>
<br>
Have a lot of fun.  I'm sure you'll get some great advice from the fun<br>
group of boxers here in Colorado!!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You will indeed be staying in Summit County.  I would imagine that all of the boxes there will be buried under the record snow falls that we have had this year.  I highly doubt that you will be able to get to any of them.  There are nice boxes in neighboring Grand County also, but again, you would need a snowshovel to get to them.  You may have luck with some further out towards Glenwood...  Es, help me out here.  You might be able to catch some that are close to I70 going further east like my "Yes" in Empire and Es's Buffalo Bill and Camp Chief Ouray boxes though.<br>
   <br>
  Good luck, just not a good time to plan on any mountain boxing.<br>
