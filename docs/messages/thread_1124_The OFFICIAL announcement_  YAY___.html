<br>
Come and enjoy beautiful Grand Lake, meet some old friends and make new ones, exchange personal stamps, letterbox at the event and in the surrounding area, eat, drink and be merry in general!<br>
<br>
Where: We will meet at Point Park in Grand Lake at around 11 and really, can stay as long as we want to fend off others from the picnic pavilions. I have two of them reserved from 11 until 3. Need directions to Point Park? Clues for the "Two Tracks" letterbox by AljanSundance will get you there! Point Park is more of picnic spot than a "park" so there is no playground for hopeful littles there. There is plenty of exploring to do though and it is right on the lakeshore. Who needs a playground when you have icy cold mountain water beckoning you to swim and wade? There are bathrooms right there at the park and it is handicapped accessible. <br>
<br>
What to bring: Bring your stamps and journals, I say that only because I am the kind of person that would forget them somehow. There will be an event stamp, a collaborative effort between myself and the very talented Catamount Carvers, and possibly a special event box... or two... or more? Bring something for yourself and your family to throw on the grill and a dish or drinks to share. I will make sure that there is at least one pie in attendance.<br>
<br>
I found a few webistes that might have helpful information for you about the area.<br>
<br>
www.grandlakechamber.com<br>
www.coloradodirectory.com/grandlake/<br>
www.nps.gov/romo -the official website for Rocky Mountain National Park<br>
www.grandlakelodge.com -not advocating that you stay here necessarily but there is a lot of information on this site and access to lots of great links!<br>
<br>
For those of you wondering about a place to stay that is pet friendly - I'm working on it and will post info on the RMLetterboxing group.   ...look into Isolation Peak Lodge (kinda icky, I dunno) and Spirit Lake Lodge with critters.<br>
<br>
Please RSVP and sign up for this event! If you have any questions or things that I can help you with send me an email at AljanSundance@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Bring on the boxing!!!<br>
<br>
