I will find out hopefully next week if I will be making a move to Wyoming. Cheyenne to be <br>
exact. Are there any boxers there or close to there? What are the regs for planting in a state <br>
park? Can you plant anywhere in Cheyenne? (I noticed there are a ton of geochaches). Sorry <br>
for all the questions, just getting a bit excited.<br>

<br>
That I know of, except for a school up in Cody, I don't think any boxes <br>
in the whole state of WY have been placed by locals...all passers-<br>
through.  I could be wrong.  Having checked up on my own boxes in the <br>
area, there ARE *finders* in Cheyenne, that I know for sure.<br>
<br>
Can't speak to WY State parks regs.  I know one RM boxer who does I-80 <br>
trips a lot thinks there needs to be more boxes in or near that <br>
corridor to the *east* of Cheyenne and I know my own efforts to plant <br>
in that area have been with I-80 and I-25 in mind, as there seem to so <br>
<br>
The area west of Cheyenne, or just east of Laramie called Vedauwoo is <br>
amazing and I've taken several trips up that way for camping and as a <br>
result I have a few boxes in the general area.  Also, Cheyenne isn't <br>
that far from the greater Ft. Collins area where there's some activity<br>
<br>
Let me know if you do end up moving to Cheyenne.  I have a few <br>
more...erm....thingy, ideas and "stuff" on my plate that involve WY and <br>
I sure would love to play.  Bet WY stil has more boxes than all of AK, <br>
huh?<br>

Rocky Mountain Letterboxing group.  I was born and grew up in Fort<br>
Collins and moved to Windsor in 2000 after I got married.  Windsor is a<br>
great little town of around 18,000 people and is only about a 15 minute<br>
drive to Greeley to the east, Loveland to the southwest, and Fort<br>
Collins to the northwest.  Therefore, everything is fairly close if you<br>
can't find it in town.  We have 2 large grocery stores with Walmart<br>
coming next year along along with many of the usual fast food and a few<br>
restaurants.  Now is a good time to buy in Windsor because the house<br>
prices have fallen a lot (bad for me but good for you).  Taxes are<br>
higher than I wish in Windsor because of a smaller number of large<br>
businesses to draw taxes from and therefore the homeowners taxes help<br>
foot the bill.  An advantage however is that there is not any city sales<br>
tax and therefore if you purchase something out of town like a vehicle,<br>
you will only pay state tax at 3.2% or something like that.  The school<br>
district is VERY good and does not seem to have much of any drugs,<br>
violence, or gang activity like you would see in some of the other towns<br>
around.  The community is very friendly and helpful as you can see from<br>
the response to the tornado that tore thru here last May.  I'm not sure<br>
about the home rule thing, but I think that just has to do with the city<br>
government and who controls the city I believe since small towns depend<br>
a lot on the state.  I believe that we switched to city government run<br>
in the last few years.  Windsor can have it's wind but is nowhere as<br>
cold and windy as Wyoming and the weather is pretty nice most of the<br>
time.  Many people do commute from Windsor to Wyoming or to Denver for<br>
work and therefore we are considered a "bedroom community" because many<br>
people commute to other locations for work.  This should tell you that<br>
the area, the town, the schools, and the community must be pretty<br>
special for people to choose to commute from here I would think.  <br>
 <br>
Do you think I should apply for the Chamber of Commerce?  Anyway, let me<br>
know if you have any specific questions about Windsor and I'd be happy<br>
to let you know.<br>

I'm not sure on any homeschool groups because our kids are all in one of<br>
the public schools. Windsor has 4 elementary, one middle school, and<br>
one high school which are all very good. We also have one charter<br>
school. Unfortunately you will miss all of the fun town activities this<br>
year like the free kids Easter egg hunt, the 4th of July parade,<br>
concerts in the park, and Windsor Harvest festival and parade. There's<br>
not a whole lot that happens in town between November and March or<br>
April. You dream home may still be available by then..what is the<br>
address?<br>

Well, we are defintly moving there...in November. So our dream home will<br>
probably be gone by then, but we can always pray that it is still<br>
available. Thank you so much for all of the info. We are so looking<br>
forward to our move. Is is really 9 months away? Are there any<br>
homeschool groups in Windsor?<br>
