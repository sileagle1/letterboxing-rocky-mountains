I will find out hopefully next week if I will be making a move to Wyoming. Cheyenne to be <br/>

<br/>
That I know of, except for a school up in Cody, I don't think any boxes <br/>
in the whole state of WY have been placed by locals...all passers-<br/>
through.  I could be wrong.  Having checked up on my own boxes in the <br/>
area, there ARE *finders* in Cheyenne, that I know for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Can't speak to WY State parks regs.  I know one RM boxer who does I-80 <br/>
trips a lot thinks there needs to be more boxes in or near that <br/>
corridor to the *east* of Cheyenne and I know my own efforts to plant <br/>
in that area have been with I-80 and I-25 in mind, as there seem to so <br/>
<br/>
The area west of Cheyenne, or just east of Laramie called Vedauwoo is <br/>
amazing and I've taken several trips up that way for camping and as a <br/>
result I have a few boxes in the general area.  Also, Cheyenne isn't <br/>
that far from the greater Ft. Collins area where there's some activity<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you do end up moving to Cheyenne.  I have a few <br/>
more...erm....thingy, ideas and "stuff" on my plate that involve WY and <br/>
I sure would love to play.  Bet WY stil has more boxes than all of AK, <br/>
huh?<br/>

great little town of around 18,000 people and is only about a 15 minute<br/>
drive to Greeley to the east, Loveland to the southwest, and Fort<br/>
Collins to the northwest.  Therefore, everything is fairly close if you<br/>
can't find it in town.  We have 2 large grocery stores with Walmart<br/>
coming next year along along with many of the usual fast food and a few<br/>
restaurants.  Now is a good time to buy in Windsor because the house<br/>
prices have fallen a lot (bad for me but good for you).  Taxes are<br/>
higher than I wish in Windsor because of a smaller number of large<br/>
businesses to draw taxes from and therefore the homeowners taxes help<br/>
foot the bill.  An advantage however is that there is not any city sales<br/>
tax and therefore if you purchase something out of town like a vehicle,<br/>
you will only pay state tax at 3.2% or something like that.  The school<br/>

the response to the tornado that tore thru here last May.  I'm not sure<br/>
about the home rule thing, but I think that just has to do with the city<br/>
government and who controls the city I believe since small towns depend<br/>
a lot on the state.  I believe that we switched to city government run<br/>
in the last few years.  Windsor can have it's wind but is nowhere as<br/>
cold and windy as Wyoming and the weather is pretty nice most of the<br/>
time.  Many people do commute from Windsor to Wyoming or to Denver for<br/>
work and therefore we are considered a "bedroom community" because many<br/>
people commute to other locations for work.  This should tell you that<br/>
the area, the town, the schools, and the community must be pretty<br/>
special for people to choose to commute from here I would think.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you think I should apply for the Chamber of Commerce?  Anyway, let me<br/>

I'm not sure on any homeschool groups because our kids are all in one of<br/>
the public schools. Windsor has 4 elementary, one middle school, and<br/>
one high school which are all very good. We also have one charter<br/>
school. Unfortunately you will miss all of the fun town activities this<br/>
year like the free kids Easter egg hunt, the 4th of July parade,<br/>
concerts in the park, and Windsor Harvest festival and parade. There's<br/>
not a whole lot that happens in town between November and March or<br/>
April. You dream home may still be available by then..what is the<br/>
address?<br/>

Well, we are defintly moving there...in November. So our dream home will<br/>
probably be gone by then, but we can always pray that it is still<br/>
available. Thank you so much for all of the info. We are so looking<br/>
forward to our move. Is is really 9 months away? Are there any<br/>
homeschool groups in Windsor?<br/>

&gt; Well, lucky you. I actually am the resident expert on<br/>
&gt; Windsor for the<br/>
&gt; Rocky Mountain Letterboxing group. I was born and grew up<br/>
&gt; in Fort<br/>
&gt; Collins and moved to Windsor in 2000 after I got married. <br/>
&gt; Windsor is a<br/>
&gt; great little town of around 18,000 people and is only about<br/>
&gt; a 15 minute<br/>
&gt; drive to Greeley to the east, Loveland to the southwest,<br/>
&gt; and Fort<br/>
&gt; Collins to the northwest. Therefore, everything is fairly<br/>
&gt; close if you<br/>
&gt; can't find it in town. We have 2 large grocery stores<br/>
&gt; with Walmart<br/>
&gt; coming next year along along with many of the usual fast<br/>
&gt; food and a few<br/>
&gt; restaurants. Now is a good time to buy in Windsor because<br/>
&gt; the house<br/>
&gt; prices have fallen a lot (bad for me but good for you). <br/>
&gt; Taxes are<br/>
&gt; higher than I wish in Windsor because of a smaller number<br/>
&gt; of large<br/>
&gt; businesses to draw taxes from and therefore the homeowners<br/>
&gt; taxes help<br/>
&gt; foot the bill. An advantage however is that there is not<br/>
&gt; any city sales<br/>
&gt; tax and therefore if you purchase something out of town<br/>
&gt; like a vehicle,<br/>
&gt; you will only pay state tax at 3.2% or something like that.<br/>
&gt; The school<br/>
&gt; district is VERY good and does not seem to have much of any<br/>
&gt; drugs,<br/>
&gt; violence, or gang activity like you would see in some of<br/>
&gt; the other towns<br/>
&gt; around. The community is very friendly and helpful as you<br/>
&gt; can see from<br/>
&gt; the response to the tornado that tore thru here last May. <br/>
&gt; I'm not sure<br/>
&gt; about the home rule thing, but I think that just has to do<br/>
&gt; with the city<br/>
&gt; government and who controls the city I believe since small<br/>
&gt; towns depend<br/>
&gt; a lot on the state. I believe that we switched to city<br/>
&gt; government run<br/>
&gt; in the last few years. Windsor can have it's wind but<br/>
&gt; is nowhere as<br/>
&gt; cold and windy as Wyoming and the weather is pretty nice<br/>
&gt; most of the<br/>
&gt; time. Many people do commute from Windsor to Wyoming or to<br/>
&gt; Denver for<br/>
&gt; work and therefore we are considered a "bedroom<br/>
&gt; community" because many<br/>
&gt; people commute to other locations for work. This should<br/>
&gt; tell you that<br/>
&gt; the area, the town, the schools, and the community must be<br/>
&gt; pretty<br/>
&gt; special for people to choose to commute from here I would<br/>
&gt; think. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you think I should apply for the Chamber of Commerce? <br/>
&gt; Anyway, let me<br/>
&gt; know if you have any specific questions about Windsor and<br/>
&gt; I'd be happy<br/>
&gt; to let you know.<br/>

&gt; -Actually all of Alaska has 146 boxes and all of Wyoming<br/>
&gt; has 46, so<br/>
&gt; Alaska has waaaay more <br/>
&gt; than Wyoming. I am a bit excited though, because if we do<br/>
&gt; get stationed<br/>
&gt; in Wyoming, hubby <br/>
&gt; has found our dream house in Windsor. I do have questions<br/>
&gt; about taxes<br/>
&gt; and stuff there, <br/>
&gt; maybe someone could answer. What does home rule really<br/>
&gt; mean? What are<br/>
&gt; the pros and cons <br/>
&gt; of living in colorado? Is Windsor a really small town?<br/>
