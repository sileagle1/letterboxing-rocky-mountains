                    <div class="plaintext-content">I planted 2 new boxes today - Fido (Arapahoe county) and Rattlesnake<br>
Gulch (jefferson county).  I don't have time to post the clues, as the<br>
kids are refusing to nap... but, if you are interested in making it to<br>
these boxes before I can get the clues on the board, please email me and<br>
I will get them to you as quick as possible.<br>
 <br>
PS - Rattlesnack Gulch is RIGHT on the trail.  So, it will be best to do<br>
during the week... or you will have to stop and admire all the plants<br>
and rocks a lot!  Anyway, I am not real thrilled at its hiding spot, so<br>
Sunday we are going out to see if we can find a better one.  But, if you<br>
want to go see its original spot (and tell me what you think about it),<br>
I would be happy to email you the clues.<br>
 <br>
have a great night everyone!<br>
