Disappointed not to have more time to box while in NM.  Balloon <br>
Fiesta events prevented us from getting one box.  We did find the <br>
Domingo Baca box, and the Embudo Canyon box - but the Los Vaqueros <br>
box is indeed (as Silver Eagle reported) missing - or just really, <br>
really hard to find, eh?<br>

Sorry SE - we didn't have time to head up to your Sandia Crest box, <br>
but I will get that one on my next trip.  I came home early because I <br>
was very sick while I was there.  On my way home, I attempted <br>
Funhog's Rancho de Estrellas box, but could not find it.  <br>

some boxing.  I feel better that you could not find<br>
Los Vaqueros, either.  The other boxes were placed<br>

That is great you hooked new letterboxers!<br>

Que lastima! You ONLY got to do balloon stuff. <br>

It's a pity that it is missing. In spite of being a commercial stamp, it was a very nice <br>
presentation. It was not particularly hard to find and not an especially secure hiding <br>
place.<br>
