was on your agenda at all.<br>
<br>
NEW MEET DETAILS:<br>
We're moving the meet to Saturday May 2nd from 10am to Noon. Same place,<br>
same time ... new date. Let's pray for more hospitable weather.  I've<br>
updated the details on AQ<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We're at 6300' and have about 5 inches of snow in depth.  We got a ton of moisture in rain and melting snow before it began to stick.  Yoque was stunned at how slushy and slippery the roads were last night when he was coming home.  Lots of folks were having trouble getting up their driveways.  We do have electricity!<br>
