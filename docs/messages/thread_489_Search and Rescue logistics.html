                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am a search and rescue dog handler with a volunteer SAR team based out<br>

inaccurate.  The vast majority of search and rescue personnel are<br>
volunteers.  These volunteers donate their time, gas money, and most of<br>
their equipment to the cause.  Also, my team has never billed a lost<br>
party for their rescue (maybe the state does?).  Most years, but not<br>
always, DOLA gives us a small, but much appreciated grant that we use to<br>
purchase things like radios, pagers, and avalanche beacons.  But, it is<br>
far from staffing, equipping, and training.  Also, with the SAR card, I<br>
do not believe that helicopter medical evacuations are covered, just the<br>
use of a helicopter for searching.<br>
<br>
On another note, I will explain a frustration experienced by volunteer<br>
SAR folks: my team typically gets over 50 calls a year, and about 40 of<br>
those get canceled before we even show up.  These are mostly due to poor<br>
communication between the hiker and the person at home who dials 911 when<br>
their partner does not show up when they thought they said they would. <br>
Our pagers start beeping during dinner with our families, we grab our<br>
gear, load the dog into the truck, say goodbye, and drive off for the<br>
trailhead to help someone we assume is in need.  When we are about half<br>
way there, the pager beeps again with a cancellation message... the<br>
"overdue hiker" wasn't really lost, just stopped for a piece of pie on<br>
the way home (or something like that).  What we tell people before they<br>
go out 'a-wandering' is first to take a hiking partner with them, but to<br>
also have someone else (at home) know where they are going, what<br>
equipment they have with them, plan A and plan B, when they expect to<br>
return, and a well-established time they should call 911 if they have not<br>
returned.<br>
<br>
In our mission logbook, we have categories we assign for the missing<br>

Maybe someday we will add a "Letterboxer" category, but so far we haven't<br>
had any of those (that we know of)... maybe because LBers are usually<br>
equipped with map & compass, and a set of directions.<br>
<br>

Don't think (not saying that anyone here would do this) that having your cell phone will automatically save you!  We get soooo many calls from people who take their phone, then leave their brains behind, don't bother to bring any supplies or prepare themselves at all thinking - well, if I have a problem, I will dial 911, they will know right where I am and drop in a helicopter to save me.<br>
 <br>
...They watch waaayyyyy to much TV.<br>
 <br>
Good for you Dave!  You rock!  ...with the whole SAR thing.  I would love to do it here but just plain don't have the time to commit.  I keep saying "When the kids are older I"ll _______ insert various goals here"<br>

Oops! I guess I should have read the SAR card page again before I <br>
started talking about it.<br>
<br>
As for cell phones, a lot of the places I go don't get any reception. <br>
So they can't be counted on anyway. But when my friend dislocated her <br>
shoulder last spring about a mile of steep trail from the road, I was <br>
thankful to be able to call 911. I hate to think of leaving her alone <br>
in that much pain to run for help.<br>
<br>
After that experience I have great respect and appreciation for the <br>
skilled people that respond to other people's emergencies. I really <br>
wonder what we would do without them.<br>

Talk about heroes.  Y'all deserve a standing ovation.<br>
<br>
I have no doubt that a person who has experienced the trauma of <br>
being lost or hurt and totally dependent on you volunteers for their <br>
rescue would prefer a sloppy kiss from your German Shephard over pie <br>
any time.  I can't even imagine how many happy endings would have <br>
ended otherwise without all of you who are willing to drop <br>
everything and help.  <br>

wow, I love that you do that!  I have some friends that were search<br>
and rescue volunteers in Utah.  They would take turns camping out on<br>
weekends at the base of Mt. Timpanogos.  It is a pretty intensive full<br>
day or overnight hike and there were enough people that would go<br>
unprepared and end up getting stuck or hurting themselves that they<br>
kept a rescue crew close during the summer months.  She loved being<br>
able to help and camp/hike in one fell swoop.<br>
<br>
I have to admit that I've joked about being tempted to "get lost" in<br>
the mountains here a time or two.  I wouldn't really do it, but<br>
Harrison Ford has a home in Jackson and is a helicopter pilot who<br>
occasionally volunteers for rescues.  How would that be to spend a day<br>
or two lost in the Tetons and have him be the one to pick you up? :) <br>
I could handle that--minus the lost part, that is.<br>
<br>
