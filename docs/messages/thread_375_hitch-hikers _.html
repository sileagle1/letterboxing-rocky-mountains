I wouldnt bother with an ink pad but just the journal and stamp (in a zip lock).<br>
The one I just found had the name of the HH written on the zip lock.  Most have email addresses in them so you can email when you find one (which I always do).<br>
I would also remind you to stamp your personal stamp in it (as the placer) and stamp the first host box in it.  Hopefully as it travels people will stamp the log with the boxes it is placed in AND their personal stamps-that way people can track how far its gone.  Both the HH I found did not have the current host stamp in them so you couldnt really tell where they had been. Personal stamps dont always have locations. One one of them it was originally placed by Doublesaj & Old Blue- I emailed them and they were happy to hear where it had been-they were surprised it was in CO (they are from CA).<br>

  I am off to CA in a few days and would like to carve a hitch-hiker to leave in one of the boxes in honor of my Grandfather who loved to travel.  So, do I just do the stamp a journal and an ink pad?  And then do I leave my email address there in the journal so finders can let me know where it has been found and then gone?<br>
