drive up through the mountains and found a variety of boxes hidden out<br>
there.  I won't name the majority since several are mystery boxes and I<br>
don't want to spoil them, but if any are wondering, Ochre Rocks are alive.<br>
I had just a wonderful day.  There was one box that we couldn't find.  I'm<br>
going to email the placer.  Let me know off-list if anyone is heading this<br>
direction and is curious to know more of what to look for.<br>
