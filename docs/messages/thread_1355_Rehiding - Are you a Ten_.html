This was recently reposted on AQ and I thought it wouldn't be a bad <br/>
idea to repost here....Given some boxes which have gone missing in <br/>
our area and having checked up on some of my own boxes lately, and <br/>
frankly a bit well, wow - me NOT a happy camper!  <br/>
<br/>
Please pay special attention if you are boxing with KIDS!<br/>
<br/>
Rehiding: Are you a ten? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do you score on rehiding the box?<br/>
Are you a ten? Or do you race from box to box?<br/>
<br/>
1. Scope the area for mugglers before rehiding.<br/>
Assign a scout.<br/>
2. Deflate, squeeze, seal each and every ziplock with<br/>
the zeal of an obsessive compulsive, anally retentive<br/>
ferret.<br/>
3. Perform a complete contents check to ensure nothing<br/>
has been left out of box.<br/>
4. Screw, snap, burp the box tightly and<br/>
appropriately. Shake &amp; check.<br/>
5. Rehouse box in exact location as found. Kneel if<br/>
necessary.<br/>
6. Replace ALL rocks, leaf litter, branches in an<br/>
artful but casual manner.<br/>
7. Do a complete 360 sway to make sure the box is not<br/>
visible from any horizontal angle.<br/>
8. Execute 5 or more stork stretches, peck`n bend to<br/>
ensure that the box is not visible from any vertical<br/>
angle.<br/>
9. Rehide the box yourself! Your child, aged<br/>
grandmother or newbie friend should NOT do this.<br/>
10. Perform final site and perimeter check. Move on<br/>
slowly. Speed kills boxes.<br/>
<br/>
