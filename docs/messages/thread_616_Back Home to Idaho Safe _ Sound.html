Yay!! I'm glad you all made it safely. I know Cadenza didn't leave <br/>
until this afternoon, so hopefully she'll check in and we'll know she <br/>
made it home safely! Thanks again for the fun and your enthusiasm! <br/>
We'll definitely have to meet up again!<br/>

going and I made it back ridiculously late. I just had to get a few more <br/>
boxes. Oh to have been able to go on Saturday too! It was painful to leave <br/>
some boxes behind. <br/>
 I can't write at this moment, but I found about 21 boxes over the weekend <br/>
(!! That does include a few hitchers though). I will have to post which <br/>
later. Kat has my Little Wild Horse box since my schedule was so booked. <br/>
Look for it soon. I also planted one on the way home that may be a bit out <br/>
of the way for some. It is in Helper, UT-an odd little town with an <br/>
interesting history. I will try to plant the clue soon.<br/>
 It was wonderful to finally meet so many of you! I love getting together <br/>
with others who are as crazy as I am! We will have to go play again sometime <br/>
soon.<br/>

prop her eyes open at work.<br/>

Searching....we're still Searching.  =-) We loved it.  Of course we <br/>
made it back to SEARCHING and we're so excited. (We're addicted like <br/>
the rest of you).  =-) Sorry we missed you there, but we just had to <br/>
place some more boxes before leaving town so it took us a tad bit <br/>
longer to hit the road.  You guys were the best to put up with us.    <br/>
THE Searching hiding spot was perfect.   It helps if we stick to the <br/>
clues...who would have thought. It was perfect.  =-)  Lizman and I <br/>
were right there the first time, but I got spooked by HUGE paw prints <br/>
near that cave looking area so made us get out of there quick as it <br/>
was getting dark not even thinking that was so close to the <br/>
SPOT........so many HOUSE ROCKS so little time.  Loved it all.  =-)  <br/>
Now I need to go unpack my car before write more.  I so loved meeting <br/>
all of you and Kelly, Alex and I were all smiles thinking of all our <br/>
new friends on the drive home.  Definitely meeting all of you was the <br/>
best and think of all the letterboxes to go with that....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So excited to for the rest of you to find out boxes......do we post <br/>
them one at a time or all at once or what??????  Can you stand it <br/>
KAT, Rivergeek and Kennamtn?????  =-)   Good times.  I'm so tempted <br/>
to come back down to Moab this weekend and find the rest of the <br/>
boxes.......OK so perhaps I'm still not thinking clearly after this <br/>
weekend fun of late night carvings with friends, early morning <br/>
adventures with new friends.....boxes, boxes and more boxes.  =-)  <br/>
You all ROCK!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Here's the question of the weekend, will Stubby the Toothslayer ever <br/>
box again after being around us crazy folk?  I personally think that <br/>
he's addicted now too, but I can't say for sure.  =-)  My husband <br/>
just laughed at that,  Jason knows me too well.  =-)  <br/>
Keep the boxes coming.  If you plant them, I will come.  =-) <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Will Stubby the Toothslayer keep going? We were a pretty nutty bunch to <br/>
begin with, but when you get us sleep deprived from a combination of <br/>
driving, staying up carving on top of that, running around on trails all <br/>
day, and just plain full of letterboxing excitement, we must just look like <br/>
a psychotic bunch! We'll have to try it again with more sleep . . . Oh, who <br/>
am I kidding?<br/>
 We did get back to both Searching and Ticaboo, well it was my 1st time at <br/>
Searching. I loved the spot and absolutely loved the clue. I will admit to <br/>
frustration initially as we passed many of what I considered to be boulder <br/>
fields and house size rocks (Blackvelvetrav asked "what value home? 1 Mill? <br/>
70K? :) But when we got to the one the clue referred to, I thought "this has <br/>
GOT to be it! Big and hard to get around." I'm a LOTR fan too, so the clue <br/>
was just fun. I wrote the poem down in my logbook to remember. It was nice <br/>
to see that it was from someone who did the books, not just the movie. Not <br/>
everyone knows about things like entwives. I also emptied my film at Tikaboo <br/>
with some fun scenery. I love that country!<br/>
 Ramdelt, I think we just missed you at searching. We got there with <br/>
Boxerlover too and kidnapped her to go find more boxes together. CW <br/>
Sunseeker and I spent a lovely afternoon hitting more boxes on 128 with her.<br/>
 I'm still just tickled with finally being able to put names with faces and <br/>
sharing the time with all of you. I've never met another boxer on the trail <br/>
in my life and this weekend I bumped into five or six on the trail and about <br/>
the same number in restaurants. It was a kick! I've always been so jealous <br/>
of those eastern types talking about seeing others out hunting on the same <br/>
trail! I can't tell you how fun it was for me to pull up to Moab Man for a <br/>
quick find before the gathering after 8-9 hours of driving, and to spot <br/>
A-Bear and find out CW Sunseeker, Blackvelvetrav and Lizman were in the car <br/>
along with Ramdelt and Stubby, who they had bumped into earlier. It was such <br/>
a surreal experience for me! Now I need more of those.<br/>
 till later,<br/>
