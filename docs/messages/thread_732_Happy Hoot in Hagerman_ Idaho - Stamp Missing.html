                    <div class="plaintext-content">Apparently the last visitors on 6/11/05 took the stamp and left some <br/>
odd items behind in this box (a rubber ball and pen like you get from <br/>
medical/drug companies at conferences.) I think they might have been <br/>
confused as this is not a Geo box. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I will not get a new stamp into the box for several <br/>
weeks because of traveling but will replace as soon as I can.<br/>
<br/>
I am posting this information just hoping on an odd chance that <br/>
whoever took the stamp will see this message and will return the <br/>
stamp.  I know it's a long shot but you never know.  I will also post <br/>
on the Atlas Quest Idaho Boards too.<br/>
<br/>
I am also concerned that other boxes may be in jeopardy if they have <br/>
found more than one recently.  They might just have a nice collection <br/>
of stamps by now.  The horror of it all!<br/>

Thanks - Blackvelvetrav<br/>
