are unable to make this gathering.  Hopefully we will be able to make <br/>
the next one, I am anxious to meet some area letterboxes and share <br/>
stories. We are traveling to UT that weekend to visit family and of <br/>
course to get some UT letterboxes. Was wondering if all those new boxes <br/>
are going to be permanent plants that we can get in the upcomming weeks <br/>
or is that just for the people who are able to attend this weekend.  <br/>
