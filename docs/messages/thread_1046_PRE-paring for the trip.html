South of Ouray the highway has been kept pretty clean lately. Unless <br>
you are driving while it is snowing you can pretty much count on dry <br>
roads.<br>
<br>
We finally got a good dumper snowstorm, though, so any letterboxes <br>
past Ouray will be covered by several feet of snow until you get <br>
down to Durango.<br>
<br>
I don't know what your plans are, but if you pass through Durango at <br>
any point let me know so we can exchange. (Unless I'm still <br>
backpacking).<br>
