<br/>
I have one other thing for you to check out in the Railyard.  Do the <br/>
tracks cross anywhere...as in "X" marks the spot?  Do they cross at <br/>
Main street or on 2nd??<br/>
<br/>
Just thinkin'<br/>

&gt; Y...do you have any more clues for us?  Need more clues!  I was <br/>
&gt; thinking about NUMBER when you mentioned you saw those horse statues <br/>
&gt; and of course the train.  Could the number be the TRAIN number or <br/>
Track <br/>
&gt; number.  Is the track between the train and the horse statues.  24/7 <br/>
&gt; questions may be asked...maybe you have to ask the Depot the track <br/>
&gt; number???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just thinkin'...need more clues!<br/>

How about an ATM!  It's accessible 24/7 and you're always asked for <br/>
your card your password!  Any ATM's in the area?<br/>
<br/>
JeLy, Ahoy!  Good to hear from you, like your "T" ideas!  hhmmmmm...a T <br/>
in the railyard???  Main Street and College Drive kind of look like a T <br/>
on the map; as well as 5th and 2nd; and also there appears to be a <br/>
street that leads into the railyard that "T"s with 5th.<br/>
