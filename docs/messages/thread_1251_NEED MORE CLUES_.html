I have one other thing for you to check out in the Railyard.  Do the <br>
tracks cross anywhere...as in "X" marks the spot?  Do they cross at <br>
Main street or on 2nd??<br>

How about an ATM!  It's accessible 24/7 and you're always asked for <br>
your card your password!  Any ATM's in the area?<br>
<br>
JeLy, Ahoy!  Good to hear from you, like your "T" ideas!  hhmmmmm...a T <br>
in the railyard???  Main Street and College Drive kind of look like a T <br>
on the map; as well as 5th and 2nd; and also there appears to be a <br>
street that leads into the railyard that "T"s with 5th.<br>
