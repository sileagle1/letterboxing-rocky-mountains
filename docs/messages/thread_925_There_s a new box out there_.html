We found this one on the Friday after you planted it. Dixie Peach and<br/>
Capt. Ron were first finders and then someone who was new to boxing found<br/>
it. It was their first box. Poor souls are sure going to be<br/>
disappointed after that as a first find!!! It is a wonderful box! <br/>
Dave's dad is from Romania and we've traveled through Transylvania. The<br/>
people there were wonderful and we didn't meet up with a single vampire! <br/>
Hope you had a most relaxing time and easing back to your everyday life<br/>
of work and Grand Lake.<br/>
