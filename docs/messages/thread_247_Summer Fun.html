great trip!<br>

We planted some on the east slope of Colorado last week, but never <br>
made it to Durango. We're going to try again in another couple of <br>
weeks. The Three Keys is taunting me.. must.. find....hehehehe<br>
<br>
We really had a blast letterboxing, even though the rain and hail <br>
were intense.  One of our best memories is scrambling through the <br>
rocks to find Eoghan's Pikes Peak Railway box while the lightening <br>
literally exploded in the sky, the thunder shook the mountains around <br>
us and hikers piled down off the mountain! Good times. Bet we were <br>
closer to our car then you three were, though! Talk about good <br>
memories.. you guys will be talking about that 30 years from now!<br>
