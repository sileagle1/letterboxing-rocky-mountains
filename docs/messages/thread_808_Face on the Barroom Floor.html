along with Aljan Sundance and her husband, Donnie, have teamed <br>
together to create a new identity, the "4 Quarters"!  Watch for our <br>
new boxes!  Aljan is putting her carving skills to work for the <br>
stamps for these boxes and Dixie Peach and Cap'n Ron are providing <br>
the journals along with scouting/planting the boxes.  Because we <br>
have teamed up, we are putting 2 journals in our boxes for you to <br>
stamp into; one per couple.  We hope to see your stamp in them!<br>
<br>
Our first box is The Face on The Barroom Floor located above Central <br>
City.  Letterboxing- the NEW gold RUSH to Central City!  <br>
<br>
To the box:<br>
<br>
Take I-70 West and exit at the 243 Exit to Central City.  Drive the <br>
Central City Parkway for 8 miles into town.  As you come down the <br>
hill into town drive past the parking light keeping to the right.  <br>
Turn right on Gregory (The signpost is on the left, not the right <br>
hand side of the street).  Take Gregory past the Fortune Valley <br>
Casino.  After a very short distance, on your left, you will see an <br>
open area to park in with stone walls of an old building.  Buses use <br>
this to wait in, so be careful where you park.  <br>
<br>
Walk back up to Gregory and across the street you will see a street <br>
sign for Packard Road.  It is a dirt road and the start of your <br>
hike.  As you walk up this old wagon road, you will be passing the <br>
Black Hawk Central City narrow gauge railroad bed (you won't see any <br>
railroad ties!).  Turn left and walk along the railroad bed for <br>
approximately 25 yards.  On your right you will see another old <br>
wagon trail.  Take this right and continue approx  mile uphill.  As <br>
you near the top, watch for another old wagon road on the right.  <br>
This road will take you around the side of the mountain.  BECAREFUL <br>
to take the 2nd right hand turn.  The 1st is NOT the one you want <br>
and has a circle of rocks and a pile of dirt blocking the road!  The <br>
correct path is just a very short distance further up the hill.  <br>
Turn right and follow this road.  Approx. 1/2 of a mile, you will <br>
arrive at a large deserted mining complex known as the Homer Mine.  <br>
Immediately upon seeing the mine, you will see DANGER KEEP OUT <br>
painted on an old rusty tank on the right hand side of the road.  <br>
Stand on the road even with this tank and GO BACK 11 paces.  Look <br>
uphill at 120 degrees.  You will see an Aspen tree with a pile of <br>
rocks next to it (a telltale sign of a hidden letterbox).  To the <br>
right of the pile of rocks is an evergreen about 8 feet tall.  Climb <br>
15-20 steps uphill to the pile of rocks and you will uncover the 4-<br>
Quarters' first planted letterbox.<br>
<br>
After rehiding the box you have a choice to make.  <br>
<br>
1st Choice:  Go back the way you came.  This is the fastest way back <br>
to your car and for the most part, is down hill.<br>
<br>
2nd Choice:  Continue to travel downhill on the path (it isn't used <br>
a lot and the grass is growing over it) that will take you towards a <br>
home being constructed.  If you veer a bit to the right, you will <br>
see an old wagon road that leads to the crest of hill that overlooks <br>
Central City.  This has a great view.  If you go down the hill <br>
alongside the house, you will be on Virginia Canyon Road.  <br>
Immediately to your right is a large sign that was constructed by <br>
the Women in Mining.  Walk down the hill and back down to Central <br>
City.  Turn right on Spring Street and follow Spring Street to <br>
Gregory road and turn right.  Take Gregory down the hill to your <br>
where you parked.<br>
<br>
If you like, you can see the Face on the Barroom Floor by touring <br>
The Teller House (tickets sold across the street from the Teller <br>
House).<br>
