Cool!  So - just to be clear - we can only count plants/finds since 1/1/10, not previous to that, correct?  <br>
<br>
Aljan Sundance created (am I right?) the beautiful Rocky Mountain LB patch - wonder if that image could be put on a treasure hiker tag?  It's AWESOME<br>

Yeah, you can only count hikes from 1/1/10. Sorry! I know that sucks for those of you that have been boxing in CO for a long time. But you can also count PLANTS, so quick get out and plant on some long hikes before it snows more! Now that I think about this my timing sucks. I guess we'll plant the crap out of the plains this winter and hit the mountains when the snow melts :)<br>
