as just Mandy)? It was great. Also, thanks for the *reminder*! I <br>
didn't think about checking the mystery boxes. :)<br>

  So, it was a year and a half ago and a bunch of my family came up to go to my uncle's wedding.  (We're all from Oklahoma).  We were all staying in his tiny cabin, and we needed some air.  So one day I (the only real letterboxer), my cousin Dylan(12), my sister Megan (16), my aunt Sherry, and my mom all decided to go to Marble to get this box.  The drive seemed to take forever, but it was such beautiful scenery that we didn't mind!<br>
   <br>
  We finally get there and head down the trail toward the box.  It's so very quiet here, but we hear a chainsaw in the distance (though we thought nothing of it).  We eventually make our way to the box.  The chainsaw noise is closer.  As Dylan excitedly discovers the box, the rest of us passively glance in the direction of the chainsaw noise and notice a man wandering around and a truck - just out there in the woods.  We couldn't really see anything else - just figured that he was out there cutting down trees or something.  Men working in the woods are creepy.  I was anxious to stamp in and get out of there!  <br>
   <br>
  As I finish stamping in (took me a little bit - I marvelled over the stamp - It was only about my 15th find and I was in awe of it all), my mom was walking toward me, coming FROM the chainsaw noise.  She whispered loudly, "COME HERE!  COME LOOK!"  "What?!"  I couldn't imagine what could be so interesting about Creepy Man.  But mom was grinning, so I followed.  She led me up and over a hill.  What I saw made my jaw drop.<br>
   <br>
  There in front of us was a mass of people spread out.  Most of them had chainsaws.  They weren't cutting trees.  The were carving marble.  HUGE chunks of marble, man-sized.  We wandered around, all of them watching us curiously - or rather, like "what are you guys doing here?"  But we were like, "What are YOU doing here????"   Somebody finally told us that they were preparing for some sort of festival or something.  We saw huge, stone eagles, full-size deer, and so so much more.  Some were complete, others were just getting started.  It was incredible!!  Such talent.  Everything looked so realistic, and yet glassy, too.<br>
   <br>
  We finally left, knowing we were just in the way.  But we laughed in awe and talked about it the whole walk back, the whole ride back to Carbondale (to my uncle's), and probably the rest of the day, telling each other member of our family about what we experienced.  <br>
   <br>
  We knew it was something special.  I mean, what are the odds that we'd come from another state to that very letterbox that would lead us to see something so magical that just happened to be happening on that very day, and that day only??  We felt privileged.  So, Esmerelda, thanks for a wonderful experience that we'll never forget!<br>
