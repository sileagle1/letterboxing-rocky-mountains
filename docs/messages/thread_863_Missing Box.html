Of course, there are hardly any boxers that come through this way! Our <br/>
boxes usually disappear after big storms and get washed out! I'm so <br/>
sorry to all of you who have had boxes gone missing. I have had some <br/>
trouble with some of my California boxes being left out and taken, <br/>
which makes me wonder if someone over here might not be rehiding them <br/>
very well. I met someone in California who thought you were supposed <br/>
to rehide them and leave them slightly showing, so that other people <br/>
would be able to find them, DOH!<br/>
