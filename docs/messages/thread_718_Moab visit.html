                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
I spent a scorching couple of days in the fair city of Moab this past<br/>
weekend and found some boxes I had to relegate to the waiting list<br/>
during the April gathering due to lack of time - so many boxes! Also<br/>
found a few of the new boxes left by out-of-towners at the event.<br/>
Kennamtn's Negro Bill:  What a wonderful canyon to hike - more<br/>
wonderful on the way up in the cooler morning than on the trek down in<br/>
the midday heat. Although there were many folks on the trail and at<br/>
the bridge, not one ventured to the west end while I was stamping in!<br/>
Nice stamp. I hope I was able to avoid the plentiful poison ivy -<br/>
VERY allergic. I appreciate all the warnings.<br/>
Kennamtn's Arches: It felt funny being so exposed while stamping<br/>
in! But I doubt anybody on the highway took notice of me. Another cute<br/>
stamp. I found my first HH here! And left it at another LB in the<br/>
area.<br/>
Kat's SnowShoe Kokopelli: It seemed a prudent idea to get out of<br/>
the 95 degree heat by heading for higher ground. No snow shoes<br/>
required to find this clever stamp today. Great views. I was<br/>
disappointed that the road to the Warner CG was still closed, so will<br/>
have to keep that box on the to-do list. The drive over the LaSal Loop<br/>
is breathtaking!<br/>
A-Bear's Art on the Rocks: Cute petroglyph character. Lots of<br/>
activity in the area for Memorial Day weekend; bikes, motorcycles,<br/>
ATVs, trucks with trailers. But I remained unseen from the road here.<br/>
Good spot.<br/>
Blackvelvetrav's Kokopelli's Hole in One: Who'd have ever<br/>
thought golf was that old! Delightful stamp. It's surprising with<br/>
all the comings and goings that no one stopped to look at the Birthing<br/>
Rock; maybe they've already seen it.<br/>
Aljan's Phoenix Rising: Those of you who have not yet been here<br/>
are in for a treat!  Fantastic box: stamp, journal, location. This one<br/>
has it all!<br/>
I will upload some pertinent photos to this site after I resize them.<br/>
Lastly, I have placed my very first LB in your area. Hope you like it.<br/>
It's called When a Frog is a Horse.<br/>
<br/>
News flash!  I was just typing this when I got an email from Kat. She<br/>
and Kennamtn have already found my box! What a hoot! Their experience<br/>
with Onion Creek was exactly what I intended! Ok, now the rest of you<br/>
get out there.<br/>

the best excuse.<br/>
<br/>
I was thwarted by the snow when I tried to get to Warner Lake also. <br/>
It seems so funny to be ready to die from heat stroke and not be able <br/>
to look for a letterbox because the snow has the roads closed!<br/>
<br/>
It's good to hear from you, Boxerlover, and good to hear that Kat and <br/>
Kenna aren't leaving any stones un-turned.<br/>
