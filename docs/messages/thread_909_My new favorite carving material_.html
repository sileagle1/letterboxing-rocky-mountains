Watch that stuff when you do put it in the freezer though...  it makes it really easy for the blade to jump and impale itself in your finger.<br>

I've been using the white stuff.  It's so soft and easy to carve.  I <br>
haven't ever tried putting it in the freezer.. I'll give that a <br>
shot.  Mostly I just use my magnifying lense light thingie and my <br>
squished down nib.  Which is why all the stamps of people have scary <br>
eyes!  hehehe<br>

well.  Sometimes I find that I have to put the pink stuff in the <br>

Hey, Miss Moon was the one who picked up my McCaffrey's Legacy HH <br>
after Flyboy carried it off from The Onion II to NYC!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">No they are talking about VERY different things. Mastercarve carves well,<br>
but the white Speedball stuff is deserving of expletives that I prefer not<br>
to use in this family-friendly forum. It is nasty stuff and crumbles like no<br>
other (okay, those gum erasers may give it a run for their money). My second<br>
stamp was carved in it and I never carved another even though I had a full<br>
sheet. Even as a beginner, I could see it was absolute junk!<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm a PZKut user too. It will be a while before I have orange<br>
stuff though since I bought a lifetime supply when I thought they were going<br>
out of business. I have also used the pink stuff, but I haven't had as<br>
consistent of results. I think it has something to do with the fact that so<br>
few people carve here, so you never know how long it has been on the shelf.<br>
My last sheet of pink had this effect like a thin film of something that got<br>
in the way. It was so weird and made carving a pain.<br>

the same stuff that Es uses.  BUT, it looks like we've been carving with<br>

Mastercarve and check it out!  Could this revolutionize our lives?<br>

The original PZcut that I had was white, but I only had a small <br>
amount.  The white I use now is Staetler Mastercarve.. it comes in a <br>
4 x 4 size, which is why Buffalo Bill and other assorted stamps are <br>
4x4!<br>
It's soft as buttuh.  <br>

the stuff that I have is by Speedball, same company as the pink <br>
stuff.  But it sucks and the pink stuff doesn't.<br>
