I know this has been touched on in the past, but couldn't find <br/>
anything in the old posts.  Does anyone know where in the Denver metro <br/>
area to find replacement tips for a Speedball Lino cutter?  I've found <br/>
several places online, but was wondering if there is someplace to just <br/>
go and pick them up.  Never seen any at Michael's and Hobby Lobby's <br/>
selection is very limited.  Any info is appreciated!  Thanks!<br/>
