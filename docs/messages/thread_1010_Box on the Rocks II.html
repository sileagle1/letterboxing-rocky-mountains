getting the hankerin' for some Moab 'boxing, but so far we have just <br>
been thinking about if we can do it at all.<br>
<br>
I had to go to Grand Junction for a couple of days of workshops and I <br>
was fortunate enough to be rescued in the afternoons for some <br>
letterboxing by Es. I found all three Retro Candies, a special Airport <br>
Letterbox and another killer one about riding the Bus. I had so much <br>
fun that all I can think about is the next gathering.<br>

Yellowstone/Jackson/the Grand Tetons.  I am looking toward doing one this<br>

y'all?  (Don't worry or flame me though, I'm not advocating leaving boxes in<br>
the National Parks.)  I think it could be a kick.  There are some fun boxes<br>
out here.  You have to travel a little bit more to catch them all, but what<br>
fun travel it is!  There are boxes on either sides of the parks that are<br>
easily accessible, and if you want to drive a bit more out of the way or if<br>
you are coming from the east, there are a bunch going through Cody and<br>
Wapiti.  Cody is a kick of a tourist town if you are into cowboys, rodeo and<br>
such.  It was founded by Buffalo Bill Cody and flaunts it to the umph<br>
degree.<br>
<br>
I don't want to plan much though if you all can't make it because, well<br>
frankly, I'm the only letterboxer in this half of my state that would be<br>
willing to come to a gathering.  I recognize that it is hard to say without<br>
knowing a date, but in general, do you think we could have enough interest<br>
to draw people up into this fun country?<br>
