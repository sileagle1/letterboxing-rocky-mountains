<br>
Silver Eagle, where in TX are you?  My family just moved out to Sulphur<br>
Springs and my uncle is in Dallas.  I also lived in Houston for 1.5 years<br>
and hope to get back and visit sometime.  If you are anywhere near any of<br>
those spots, we will have to plan an exchange sometime while I'm visiting.<br>
I don't know how long it will be though till I can make it.  I have used up<br>
all of my annual leave and I have a brother getting married in San Diego in<br>
October so that will take what little leave I can scrounge up.<br>
<br>
Well, till later<br>
Cadenza<br>

Glad to hear your 1st gathering was successful!  Wish I could<br>
have been there since I have never been to an event (never<br>
actually met other letterboxers outside immediate family) and<br>
there aren't enough Texas Letterboxers yet to hold an event<br>
here.  Maybe next time I head up that way I can meet some of<br>
you then.<br>
