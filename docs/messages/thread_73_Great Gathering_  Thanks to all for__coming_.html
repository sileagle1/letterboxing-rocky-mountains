<br/>
Silver Eagle, where in TX are you?  My family just moved out to Sulphur<br/>
Springs and my uncle is in Dallas.  I also lived in Houston for 1.5 years<br/>
and hope to get back and visit sometime.  If you are anywhere near any of<br/>
those spots, we will have to plan an exchange sometime while I'm visiting.<br/>
I don't know how long it will be though till I can make it.  I have used up<br/>
all of my annual leave and I have a brother getting married in San Diego in<br/>
October so that will take what little leave I can scrounge up.<br/>
<br/>
Well, till later<br/>
Cadenza<br/>

Glad to hear your 1st gathering was successful!  Wish I could<br/>
have been there since I have never been to an event (never<br/>
actually met other letterboxers outside immediate family) and<br/>
there aren't enough Texas Letterboxers yet to hold an event<br/>
here.  Maybe next time I head up that way I can meet some of<br/>
you then.<br/>

&gt; Well - the weather was warmer than I expected, but the turnout for<br/>
&gt; our 1st Colorado RMLetterboxing Gathering was better!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A recap for those that couldn't attend ...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We met at the visitor's center for Roxborough State Park only to<br/>
&gt; discover that there isn't a picnic table ANYWHERE in the park.<br/>
&gt; However, we had food and were not to be dissuaded from eating! So<br/>
we <br/>
&gt; spread out on a bench, and did some meet &amp; greet, took photos and<br/>
&gt; such.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then we headed up the trail to the Fountain Valley Letterbox<br/>
(planted <br/>
&gt; way back in '00 by the Drew Clan).  Up there at the overlook, we<br/>
all <br/>
&gt; stamped into the box, passed around the American Pride HH (sent<br/>
from <br/>
&gt; Buffy of the Travelin' Trouts) and made exchanges all around.  My<br/>
&gt; personal traveller made its debut, and our little event stamp will<br/>
&gt; soon be turned into a hitchhiker!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dixie was effervescent - bringing several friends with her that<br/>
were <br/>
&gt; new to boxing --- Jill, Jim &amp; Cathy, and Laura (YaYa).  I think<br/>
she's <br/>
&gt; trying to single-handedly convert everyone she knows to the hobby!<br/>
&gt; Eoghan and his beautiful fiance' Pumpkin Princess were there, as<br/>
were <br/>
&gt; Fiona &amp; Joe.  Lisa (Tie-Dye Gal) and her daughter Nicole came, and<br/>
&gt; the prize for longest distance travelled to get to the gathering<br/>
goes <br/>
&gt; to Guara &amp; The Foreman (and hubby John) who drove all the way in<br/>
from <br/>
&gt; Monument!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We all decided we can't wait to do it again, but we'll choose a<br/>
park <br/>
&gt; that allows DAWGS next time!!  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy to have met everyone!<br/>
