Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
This past weekend Al and I went to Bullfrog; he rode his motorcycle<br/>
and I drove my dry, comfortable 4-wheels. He's training for a cycle<br/>
trip to OK to visit relatives this September. And I just GO any time<br/>
someone says the word!<br/>
<br/>
We found a few letterboxes along the way. 1) Cadenza's Historic Helper<br/>
LB - First finder to this one! Excellent stamp. Had to REALLY reach<br/>
for the box; good thing Al's longer arms were along. I put it back,<br/>
though, so shorter arms should be able to capture it now. It is still<br/>
well out of sight and contains my first ever HH. (I know I'm not<br/>
supposed to advertise, but I REALLY want someone to pick it up.) 2)<br/>
Kelly's Sharp Tooth - First finder to this one, too, and took the<br/>
charm. Thanks! Cool stamp. There was quite a bit of water in the<br/>
ziploc, but NOT IN THE BOX. Replaced the bag. 3) Y-nought's Navajo<br/>
Code Talkers - Deciphered the code at home before we left; that was<br/>
fun! Couldn't find a reference to SHUSH GAH-GHIL-KEID at the river. If<br/>
it was grafiti, it's been painted over, but found the LB anyway by the<br/>
rest of the clue. 4) Green Tortuga's Mexican Hat - It was fun to get<br/>
into the right position using the features and degrees. And what a<br/>
marvelous formation the hat is! All the stamps were wonderful and, as<br/>
always, I love the incentive to visit new places that boxing provides.<br/>
<br/>
Lake Powell is down 140 feet, but the folks there say they are in<br/>
hopes of recovering 50 feet of that this year. The ferry to Hall's<br/>
Crossing isn't running, so we took the l-o-n-g route to Mexican Hat.<br/>
<br/>
Puppypaws, I tried a search for Alex's Birthday Candle #4 HH on Atlas<br/>
Quest by placer and HH, but came up empty, so I'm guessing JACKS<br/>
didn't register it there.<br/>
<br/>
Going to collect my mail for the past few days and hoping there are<br/>
postal LB's in it,<br/>
