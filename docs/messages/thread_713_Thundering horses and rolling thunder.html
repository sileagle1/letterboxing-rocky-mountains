I was able to check on some letterboxes this weekend that have only <br/>
recently thawed out. All five of the Animas Overlook boxes are fine and <br/>
accessible. And Wandering Aengus only needed a little bit of walking <br/>
over snow to get to. I didn't make it over to Wings of Eagles, but it <br/>
is basically the same elevation as Aengus, so it should be accessible <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that the outer plastic bags that covered many of these <br/>
letterboxes were shredded by critters over the winter. Some were so bad <br/>
that I removed them completely. I'm not sure they do much good if the <br/>
rodents won't leave them alone.<br/>
<br/>
Happy stamping,<br/>
