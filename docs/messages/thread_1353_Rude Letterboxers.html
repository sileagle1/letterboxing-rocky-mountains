you they had a bad time looking for one of your boxes, couldn't find <br/>
it, your clues were horrible, etc?<br/>
<br/>
I have met so many nice folks through this hobby, I am astounded when I <br/>
get a note like this.  Fortunately, it happens very infrequently.  I <br/>
have found about 250 boxes or so, and not all of them have been stellar <br/>
experiences, but I would never dream of writing an impolite note to <br/>
someone telling them their box, their stamp or their clues were bad.  <br/>
People spend so much time, money and effort placing boxes for my <br/>
enjoyment, how could I possibly ever criticize someone, even if I <br/>
didn't enjoy it?  It's like getting a birthday gift and telling the <br/>
person, "Oh I would never wear this," or having your kid give you a <br/>
picture they painted for you and telling them, "this is the worst <br/>
artwork I've ever seen."<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I don't know what's wrong with some people.  Makes me want to <br/>
pull in all of my public boxes.<br/>

I think a lot of people actually don't realize this<br/>
until they plant a box of their own.  But, even if<br/>
they don't get that part of the game, they should<br/>
still know better than to make rude comments.  They<br/>
are probably people who are generally rude and<br/>
unpleasant.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to hear about the rudeness. :(<br/>

Blow off some steam, but don't pull your boxes!  There will always be<br/>
unkind people in this world.  It's just the way it is.  We have also met<br/>
some of the nicest folks through letterboxing.  Most of our letterboxing<br/>
experiences have made great family memories.  Even the "bad" experiences<br/>
have resulted in a lot of laughs (past tense).  Frankly, if some clues<br/>
are off or one has concerns about a box, there certainly is a way to<br/>
deliver friendly, constructive criticism.<br/>

  Amazingly, I also had an evil letterboxer send me a nastygram about one of my boxes.<br/>
  It was one of my first boxes, and I think it might have been one of the first emails I received from anyone.  I was horrified at the time that the planting of my box sucked, until I realized later that other people found the box with no problem, and most boxers are really nice  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Keep those boxes out there, I would love to go hunt for some if I'm ever in the area!<br/>

Hey...you're talking to someone who has had two boxers.. count them <br/>
two... who actually wrote rude comments about my clues in journals!!  <br/>
And one of the journals wasn't even my box!<br/>
<br/>
"Esmerelda could learn something about clue writing from this one."<br/>
<br/>
Hey, ya land lubbin' scurvey commenter with a distinctive lack of <br/>
people skills.... feel free to avoid all Buccaneer boxes in the <br/>
future!  ARRRRRR!!  I happen to LIKE writing my clues in story form <br/>
and if you want 'walk ten paces from your car and look under the rock <br/>
with the X on it' clues then ye best be leavin' the Buccaneer boxes <br/>
alone and findin' yer fun elsewhere!<br/>
<br/>
Bean, you leave your clues exactly the way they are, mister.  If you <br/>
changed them they wouldn't be Bean boxes anymore.  And I couldn't pat <br/>
myself on the back with both arms for finding them!  The Little Man <br/>
would be so disappointed if he didn't get to go on any more <br/>
adventures with the away team. <br/>
<br/>
For cryin' out loud.  What are they gonna do?  Report you to your <br/>
letterbox supervisor?  It might go on your permanent record or <br/>
something.  Puhleeeeeese.  Don't let them get you down!  Be proud <br/>
that you're a legend!  And have plenty of pie.  A slice a day keeps <br/>
the losers at bay. <br/>

You may not believe this, but one of these people actually tried to <br/>
do just that.  They wrote the the LBNA webmaster complaining about me <br/>
and then sent me an email apprising me of this fact and telling me <br/>
that I would now have to "deal with that."  Like that does anything.  <br/>
What's Cho going to do, ban me from letterboxing?  Honestly!  Some <br/>
people's kids....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks again for all the supportive comments.  No need for <br/>
anyone to walk the plank, although that would be fun to watch.  I am <br/>
thinking about maybe adding another note to the end of all my clues, <br/>
similar to my "don't ask me for hints" note.  If PRE doesn't mind me <br/>
borrowing, it will probably say something like "These are clues, not <br/>
directions, some are purposely meant to be vague or even misleading.  <br/>
If you don't like my clues, don't complain to me about it, choose <br/>
another letterbox."<br/>

  If PRE doesn't mind me <br/>

are the clues to your "Big Fish" (big fun!!!) and Y's "Alien Gothic".<br/>
<br/>
I however, have been fortunate enough to have polite people visit my <br/>
boxes except for one box. I have a box planted 1000 miles away that I <br/>
visit only a few times a year. Right after planting it, two families <br/>
visited it with 9 kids and they allowed the kids to stamp and scribble <br/>
on the entire journal. I would guess only 2 of the kids were even old <br/>
enough to write their names. All 25 pages of my journal that took hours <br/>
to make!!! Doh, (slaps forehead) what could the parents possibly be <br/>
thinking?<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to gripe also!!!!<br/>

I just checked in to approve a first post and thought I'd see what was<br/>
going on when this post caught my eye.  I was remembering when a very<br/>
active letterboxer came to visit the Yellowstone area.  They stopped<br/>
in Idaho Falls and apparently looked for one of my box series.  I got<br/>
this terse email from them saying that they thought I had planted the<br/>
boxes too close to the water and they had all gone missing in the<br/>
Snake River because they had looked everywhere and couldn't find them<br/>
(this was in the middle of a drought, by the way-nowhere near the<br/>
water).  When I wrote back encouraging them to keep looking and saying<br/>
that the series was most definitely there they were nice enough to<br/>
tell me that I just wrote them badly then.  They were quite snippety<br/>
about it and my feelings were somewhat hurt.  I'd had tons of people<br/>
look for those letterboxes and never had any problems with my clues,<br/>
and this was a letterboxer with enough experience that they shouldn't<br/>
have had a problem.<br/>
<br/>
About a month later there were some questions on the big list or AQ or<br/>
somewhere about trips up to Yellowstone and this person got on telling<br/>
all about how there were great letterboxes to be found in the area and<br/>
they sang the praises of every letterbox but mine.  Now, not to boast<br/>
or anything, but I have some of my best ever stamps in that area.  I<br/>
mean, I have some fun letterboxes around there.  I couldn't help but<br/>
feel that the choice to exclude me from the list of good letterboxers<br/>
was a deliberate one, since I was the only local Yellowstone-area<br/>
letterboxer. I had only tried to be helpful, and I couldn't help but<br/>
feel that the tone of everything they did was bratty.  I can respect<br/>
an email saying that they didn't find a box.  I appreciate someone<br/>
letting me know there might be a problem, but this was very different.<br/>
 And then choosing to very publicly ignore me? I mean, how high-school<br/>
is that?  <br/>
