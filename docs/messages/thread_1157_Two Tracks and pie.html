<br>
Beemer Rider and I found Two Tracks today. Wanted to let you know the<br>
log book is full. Most of the folks who have registered for the<br>
gathering have already stamped in, but thought you might want to know<br>
in case you have another log book to bring.<br>
<br>
Hope I can find a pie store!<br>
