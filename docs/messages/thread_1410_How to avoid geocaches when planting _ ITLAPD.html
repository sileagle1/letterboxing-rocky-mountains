                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all!<br/>
We all know how frustrating it can be to carefully plant a box, and<br/>
then find out it wound up too close to a geocache we didn't know<br/>
about, and have our box fill up with trinkets when cachers find our<br/>
boxes by mistake (even though they're marked NOT A GEOCACHE!). Or<br/>
worse, as Jely told me about, have your stamp and log book disappear<br/>
because someone thought it was a trade item! I'm posting a geocache<br/>
browser kml file in the files section, which if you download it &amp;<br/>
double-click on it, it will open up in Google Earth (if you have that<br/>
already installed). It will show you every cache ever hidden. Of<br/>
course, not all caches will show up as there are mystery ones where<br/>
the coordinates posted are bogus and the cacher must solve a puzzle to<br/>
get the real coords. Also, stages of a multicache won't show up,<br/>
either, just the first stage. But, at least it will give us a good<br/>
general idea of where NOT to plant a box. The icons of the caches tend<br/>
to jump around a bit so it's not always the exact location, but like I<br/>
said, it will show you the general location and you'll know not to<br/>
hide one nearby. You can click on the icon, then click on the link<br/>
that appears by the cache to see where it is exactly, but you have to<br/>
be a geocaching.com member &amp; logged in to do that. Here's an<br/>
explanation of the icons<br/>
(though it's pretty self-explanatory): Question mark: mystery cache<br/>
(no cache actually thereit's within 2 mi of the fake coords, but some<br/>
cachers go there anyway if they're new). Green<br/>
cache icon: traditional cache. Yellow cache icon: multicachefirst<br/>
stage starts there unless it's also a mystery. Ghost icon: virtual<br/>
cacheno physical container, but cachers will come by that location to<br/>
get the answer to a question. Envelope icon: letterbox hybridyes,<br/>
some cachers do also letterbox! It's just like it sounds, a combo of a<br/>
cache &amp; a letterbox. Stamp/logbook + trade items.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I haven't thoroughly confused everyone now! :) Any questions,<br/>
let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, happy International Talk Like a Pirate Day<br/>
tomorrow (9/19)! Arrggh, mateys!<br/>
