                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Catamount Carvers have come out of their temporary hibernation.  We<br/>
went in search of two boxes today.  We found The Shining in Estes Park,<br/>
but its box was crushed beyond repair.  Since the owner is in Illinois,<br/>
we decided to pull it for repair.  We should have it back in place on<br/>
Sunday or Tuesday.  We'll send another e-mail when it's back in<br/>
commission.<br/>
<br/>
The Shining Letterbox was crushed by its own top covering rock.  We've<br/>
seen that happen to a few of those more disposable storage containers. <br/>
In comparison, the older, standard Rubbermaid boxes hold up incredibly<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
We also took a hike up Crosier Mountain near Glenhaven to find the Rocky<br/>
Mountain Wedding Letterbox.  It was a wonderful find with everything in<br/>
perfect order!<br/>
<br/>
If the weather cooperates, we should be getting out a box or two of our<br/>
own in the coming week!<br/>

I know what the stamp is and can't wait to see it.  We are going to eat <br/>
Christmas dinner at the Stanley and will definitely want to find that box.   <br/>
  Puppy paws and husband that won't give himself a name, but still kinda <br/>
likes to letterbox but won't really admit that either - ha<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Unless something new has happened to The Shining box in Estes Park, it<br/>
should be there.  We pulled that box about November 19th and had it back<br/>
in place on November 24th.  We sent a note to this list on both occasions<br/>
and was also in contact with the box owner.  The owner obviously hasn't<br/>
taken the "pulled for repair" note off letterboxing.org.  I'm very sorry<br/>
that we didn't see your e-mail earlier, but we were out of town.  I will<br/>
try to contact the box owner again to inform her of this problem.<br/>
<br/>
We were down in Arizona this past week and found some very nice<br/>
letterboxes in Tucson.  I must say that one of the boxes was a murderous<br/>
hike with fairly unclear clues and lots of steep grade and cholla choking<br/>
our way.  We gave up at one point, as we feared not getting back to the<br/>
car before dark.  It's the first time our kids have had any complaints<br/>
about "letterboxing."  We've had them on plenty of big hikes, but the<br/>
cacti factor put them over the edge.  Oddly enough, we got it anyway! <br/>
The stamp was really cool ... hand-carved with a handmade scroll.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays!<br/>

The box has been replaced for quite a while.  It was only out of service<br/>
for a few days.<br/>

&gt; Now I am bummed - was gonna run up to Estes Park and snowshoe on <br/>
&gt; Dec. 24 <br/>
&gt; because there is a letterbox at the Stanley Hotel....but, it has <br/>
&gt; been pulled <br/>
&gt; for repair.  Rats!   I may start a new trend if it is not there - <br/>
&gt; put <br/>
&gt; something there anyway!!  I could stamp a little piece of paper to <br/>
&gt; put <br/>
&gt; inside the box when it returns - kind of like a "get well card" for <br/>
&gt; the box. <br/>
&gt;   Is this legal?  You know, I have had this happen several times - <br/>
&gt; discovering the box was missing and it is so sad and I feel so let <br/>
&gt; down.  <br/>
&gt; So, just leave a little remembrance - like they do for <br/>
&gt; people...maybe <br/>
&gt; flowers!!!<br/>
