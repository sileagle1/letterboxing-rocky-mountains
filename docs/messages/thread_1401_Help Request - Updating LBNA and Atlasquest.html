                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm finding that keeping both these sites updated, especially after<br>
getting over 50 stamps at the Golden Treasures Gathering, to rather<br>
tedious and very time consuming. <br>
<br>
Do any of you have any tips on easy ways or shortcuts to updating<br>
these sites? Basically I am doing searches on AQ for each individual<br>
stamp, recording the find, then going over to LBNA, repeating the<br>
search and recording the find there, if it exists. As far as I can<br>
tell there's no way to determine whether an LB'er has posted to AQ,<br>
LBNA, or both.<br>
<br>
LBNA, IMHO, is more tedious. Their search engine isn't as user<br>
friendly as AQ and I just find the site harder to use in general.<br>
<br>
I thought of just dropping the update of LBNA, but I'm sure there are<br>
many LB'ers who use it exclusively.<br>
<br>
Any hints or help would be appreciated!<br>

I just double checked and it is now $35 a year.  You probably got a renewing membership, so you are locked in at that lower price of $15.  How many years ago was it that price?<br>

I would say that I joined last year but hearing that PRE has been with us 2 years now makes me think it's been longer.  I can't believe how time has flown by.  I just looked at LBNA and it looks like I started this crazy hobby in 2004!  It seems like yesterday but time is flying by.<br>
