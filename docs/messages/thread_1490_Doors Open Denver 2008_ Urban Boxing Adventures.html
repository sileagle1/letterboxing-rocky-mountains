The event listing has been updated with more detailed information <br/>
about meeting places.  With the buildings that are open and the event <br/>
boxes that are in the works, I think it will be a really fun time.<br/>

the "mostest-iness"  for putting togther this event.  Thanks also to <br/>
them, Tai Chi and Chai Tea and leviathan for placing boxes for us all <br/>
to find.  It pleases me to no end that so many folks have an interest <br/>
in coming Denver proper!  It was great to meet some new friends and <br/>
visit with some old ones.<br/>
<br/>
I've been going to Doors Open Denver every year since it started and <br/>
starting two years ago attempted to try and get boxers interested in <br/>
some of the fascinating history, culture, architecture that Denver and <br/>
this event have to offer.  Two years ago there were 3 of us wandering <br/>
the streets (and one of them was my non-boxing friend).  Last year <br/>
about 15 boxers showed up, and in the neighborhood of double that this <br/>
year :-)<br/>
<br/>
A toast and some pie to you ALL!!  May this become an annual <br/>
tradition.  The DOD location list this year was particularly well-put-<br/>
together by the Mayor's Office of Cultural Affairs.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone want to share highlights from the weekend?<br/>
<br/>
For me it was *finally* touring the Molly Brown house after all these <br/>
years of passing by it sometimes twice a day (and having a letterbox <br/>
there).  Our guide was the world's fastest talker.  Also seeing the <br/>
progress being made at the old Elitch Theatre.  The first time I toured <br/>
it was in the dark while dodging leaky ceiling areas and fox poop left <br/>
by the only residents at that time.  It's going to be amazing when that <br/>
place re-opens to the public.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a great weekend everybody!<br/>
