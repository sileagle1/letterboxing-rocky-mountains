I live really close (like three miles or so) to the Prairie Conservation <br>
Center, and would be happy to come down some day and help you out!  Just let <br>
me know!  I've found all the boxes there back in July '03 so it's been <br>
awhile, but I remember them all well.<br>
<br>
Cheers - and welcome to the group!<br>
