After we stamped in we went and had pie in a lovely pie shop.  Did you <br/>
go to the pie shop, too, FRH?  ARRRR!  I had banana cream!<br/>
<br/>
Is this a great hobby or what?!<br/>

Es, who knows that most of us forget all about the listings on the <br/>
mystery page sometimes and had so much fun with this one that she <br/>
wanted to share<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Es for the compliment.  If you solve Avian Revenge in Shadowville,<br/>
remember the "bonus box" ... The Blue Box is also listed under mystery. <br/>
I'm just sayin' while you are at it, you can give Honeywine a crack too. <br/>
It's not at the same location, but it could be on your way.<br/>
<br/>
And, there's always our older word of mouth box that's been sleepily<br/>
waiting for someone new to find it ... I'm just sayin'...<br/>
<br/>
Catamount Carvers, who turn into farmers most every Saturday morning ...<br/>
not nearly as exciting as looting and pillaging and snake charming ...<br/>
