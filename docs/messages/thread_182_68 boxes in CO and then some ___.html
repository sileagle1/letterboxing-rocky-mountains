Today was excellent!  Even though we started boxing in Texas ( in <br/>

Found today:<br/>
Woody the Beaver - we were the first to stamp in!<br/>
Rock Crawler - second attempt - wow, that was hidden very well!!!!<br/>
The Miner (Gold Rush) - great condition - excellent stamp!  Allowing <br/>

Any snake encounters while you were there?!<br/>

Rocky Crawler was a fun box! =]  Once I made it to the RIGHT parking<br/>
lot, we had to wait for over 30 minutes for the area to calm down so we<br/>
could grab it =]<br/>
