couple of them may have thawed this week in this heat wave. And if 
it's as awesome as your own stamp I'd like to see it no...

only one box in Moab that is snowed in, although the Left Hand Box 
is out of commission until it dries out. I think it needs a...

Ok, I'm tightening my shoelaces and heading out the door. I have the 
feeling you might beat me there, but that's ok because I ALWAYS 
enjoy seeing the Y & Co. stamps. I am planning on heading that...
