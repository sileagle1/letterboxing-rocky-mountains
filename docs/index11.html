                        Hi all,

No luck at all. I found myself looking in all the same places that I

need to step back and see it with a fresh outlook...

                        I'm only doing one vendor show this year, but a box or so will be with 
me, along with my fleece creations.

                        Thanks for the tips on camo tape, everyone.  I'd found some at the

other places.
