                        Should! I remember the first Gathering in Connecticut, where there 
were six attendees sitting around the campfire talking like mad. And 
just look at the place now. Wish we could be there with you...

                        depends on when I get up in the morning, when it is, and when its done.
I have a long shift on saturdays and need to be home by 5 (leave by 4)
