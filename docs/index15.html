                        I've recently relocated this LB to a more secluded spot, so reprint the 
clues if you printed them before 06-02-2008.

                        I'm sure you're all smart enough but because it's freaking me out...  make sure that you send a big enough envelope for your patch(es) - keeping in mind that they are a 5 inch circle.
