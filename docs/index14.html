                        I had two boxers report SKI TRAIN missing this week.  We aren't sure how soon we can get 
up to Winter Park to check on it.  If you'll be in the area and can double check it for me, I'd 
appreciate...

Wow! I am so amazed by the patch, it is gorgeous!
In fact, my current letterboxing bag is not worthy enough to sew the patch onto... I need to get a new backpack now...
